The alias is an amalgam of Iron Man's armor and Captain America's patriotism.\n\n\n== Fictional history ==\n\n\n=== Norman Osborn ===\n\nNorman Osborn donned the original Iron Patriot armor during the Dark Reign storyline to exert his authority as 'commander' of H.A.M.M.E.R. and his own personal Avengers. Osborn's Iron Patriot's activities have been increasingly jeopardized by various superheroes such as when he was tricked into attacking Tony Stark (in an early Iron Man suit) and when the New Avengers led by Captain America (Bucky Barnes) used Iron Patriot's tracking device on Luke Cage as a trick to destroy his own house. During his invasion of Asgard on the \"claim\" of a national security threat, Osborn's Iron Patriot armor gets dismantled remotely by Stark in the middle of Osborn's fight with Steve Rogers, revealing Osborn's Green Goblin-like facepaint in fear of the Void. When Rogers, Stark and Thor transfer him to the Raft penitentiary, Osborn blames his Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world as Iron Patriot.\n\n\n=== James Rhodes ===\n\nJames Rhodes wears the Iron Patriot armor for a while.\n\n\n=== Iron Patriot Drones ===\nDuring the Fear Itself storyline, one is seen amongst Iron Man's many armors summoned to assists the New Avengers against the new Red Skull (in the Skadi form), and is vaporized with by the female villain's new powers.During the Marvel NOW! event, another version is seen at a weapons expo that Daisy Johnson and Nick Fury, Jr. were attending. During the attack by A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics) and their fight with the Secret Avengers (which Rebel Ralston gets killed), the Scientist Supreme of the A.I.M. High Council takes the opportunity to steal the armor. The Iron Patriot armor was replicated and its low-level A.I. was grown considerably, creating an army of sentient Iron Patriot drones which A.I.M. used to incriminate the United States in numerous international attacks. When an army of Iron Patriot droids that were going to attack Iran appear, S.H.I.E.L.D. sent the Hulk to destroy the Iron Patriot droid army. Using holographic communication, S.H.I.E.L.D. hacks into the A.I.M. network which allows Rhodes to talk to the Iron Patriot drones. Rhodes makes the Iron Patriot army understand their programmed actions are wrong, and states Rhodes could teach.During the \"Inhumanity\" storyline, the Iron Patriot drones were disabled and badly damaged when the Secret Avengers were confronted by the vengeful Inhuman known as the Junkman's power of technopathy.\n\n\n=== Toni Ho ===\n\nDr. Toni Ho is an engineer with three doctorates, who wore the Iron Patriot armor as a member of the U.S.Avengers.\n\n\n=== Sharon Carter ===\n\nSharon Carter later wore her version of the Iron Patriot armor.\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nThe Iron Patriot armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in the helmet which allowed the suit to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While Iron Man's armors utilized repulsor technology, the original Iron Patriot design did not as \"Oz [was] too stupid\" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system so the chest's star-shaped Uni Beam projector had a less powerful output. However, the new Iron Patriot armor is a complete redesign that's an update of the previous model.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n\n=== American Son ===\nAmerican Son is another exoskeleton used by Harry Osborn during the \"Dark Reign\" storyline, and later by Gabriel Stacy.\n\n\n=== Iron Hulk ===\nRobert Maverick wore the Iron Patriot Armor during the \"No Surrender\" arc, calling himself Iron Hulk while combating the Hulk.\n\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nThe Ultimate Marvel equivalent of Iron Patriot armor appears during the \"United We Stand\" storyline due to Tony Stark inspired by Steve Rogers.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe Iron Patriot concept's animated debut is seen in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series, with the original armor worn by Norman Osborn and the American Son armor (known as the Patrioteer) worn by Harry Osborn.\nThe Iron Patriot concept also makes sporadic appearances in the Avengers Assemble animated series. The Iron Patriot armor is among various armors remote-controlled by Tony Stark (voiced by Adrian Pasdar) in \"Exodus\". The Iron Patriot suit is also among Iron Man's armors after Ultron's hijacks them to attack Captain America in \"Avengers Disassembled\" and Iron Man in \"The Ultimates\".
