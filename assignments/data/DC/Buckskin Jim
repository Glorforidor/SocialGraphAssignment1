The term is generally associated with an [[American comic books]] genre published from the late 1940s through the 1950s (though the genre had continuing popularity in Europe, and persists in limited form in American comics today). Western comics of the period typically featured dramatic scripts about [[cowboy]]s, [[gunfighter]]s, [[Sheriff|lawmen]], [[bounty hunter]]s, [[outlaw]]s, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s. Accompanying artwork depicted a rural America populated with such iconic images as guns, [[cowboy hat]]s, vests, horses, [[Western saloon|saloon]]s, ranches, and deserts, contemporaneous with the setting.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[Western novel]]s, [[Western film|films]], and [[pulp magazines]] were extremely popular in the [[United States]] from the late 1930s to the 1960s.\n\nWestern comics first appeared in syndicated [[Comic strip|newspaper strips]] in the late 1920s. [[Harry O&#39;Neill (cartoonist)|Harry O&#39;Neill]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Broncho Bill|Young Buffalo Bill]]&#39;&#39; (later changed to &#39;&#39;Buckaroo Bill&#39;&#39; and then, finally, &#39;&#39;Broncho Bill&#39;&#39;), distributed by [[United Feature Syndicate]] beginning in 1928, was about a group called The Boy Rangers, and was a pioneering example of the form.&lt;ref&gt;Markstein, Don. [http://www.toonopedia.com/bronchob.htm \&quot;Broncho Bill,\&quot;] Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia. Accessed Nov. 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1930s, &#39;&#39;[[Red Ryder]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Little Joe (comic strip)|Little Joe]]&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;[[King of the Royal Mounted]]&#39;&#39; were syndicated in hundreds of newspapers across the United States. [[Garrett Price]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;White Boy&#39;&#39; (later changed to &#39;&#39;Skull Valley&#39;&#39;) was another syndicated strip from the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Markstein, Don. [http://www.toonopedia.com/whiteboy.htm \&quot;Whiteboy,\&quot;] Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia. Accessed Nov. 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe first Western stories to appear in the comics were in the mid-1930s: [[National Allied]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[New Fun Comics]]&#39;&#39; #1 (Feb. 1935) ran the modern-West feature \&quot;Jack Woods\&quot; and the [[Old West]] feature \&quot;Buckskin Jim\&quot;; [[Centaur Publications]]&#39; &#39;&#39;The Comics Magazine&#39;&#39; #1 (May 1936) ran the feature \&quot;Captain Bill of the Rangers\&quot;; and [[David McKay Publications]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;Feature Book&#39;&#39; #1 (May 1937) and a single issue of &#39;&#39;King Comics&#39;&#39; (also 1937) featured &#39;&#39;[[King of the Royal Mounted]]&#39;&#39; reprints before Dell took over licensing of the character. [[Dell Comics]]&#39; &#39;&#39;[[The Funnies]]&#39;&#39; published a run of short adaptations of [[B-movie]] Westerns starting in vol. 2, issue #20 (May 1938). [[Dell Comics|Whitman Comics]]&#39; &#39;&#39;Crackajack Funnies&#39;&#39; ran regular Western features (including [[Tom Mix]] stories) beginning with issue #1 in June 1938.\n\nThe first stand-alone Western comics titles were published by [[Centaur Publications]]. &#39;&#39;Star Ranger&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Western Picture Stories&#39;&#39;&lt;ref&gt;Sexton, Lansing and Sexton, Andrea. [http://www.b-westerns.com/comics.htm \&quot;Cowboy Comic Books - an Overview: Tim Holt,\&quot;] The Old Corral. Accessed July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; both debuted from the publisher in late 1936, cover-dated Feb. 1937. &#39;&#39;Star Ranger&#39;&#39; ran for 12 issues, becoming &#39;&#39;Cowboy Comics&#39;&#39; for a couple of issues, and then becoming &#39;&#39;Star Ranger Funnies&#39;&#39;. The series ended in October 1939. &#39;&#39;Western Picture Stories&#39;&#39; ran four issues in 1937. [[Dell Comics]] published &#39;&#39;Western Action Thrillers&#39;&#39; #1 shortly thereafter (cover-date Apr. 1937), and began publishing &#39;&#39;[[Red Ryder Comics]]&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref name=Schelly&gt;Schelly, Bill and Keith Dallas. &#39;&#39;American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1950s&#39;&#39; (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2013), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; initially reprinting the long-running comic strip, in 1941.\n\n== \&quot;Golden Age\&quot;: 1948\u20131960 ==\nWestern comics became popular in the years immediately following [[World War II]], when superheroes went out of style. Adult comics readership had grown during the war years, and returning servicemen wanted subjects other than superheroes in their books. The popularity of the Western genre in comic strips and other media gave birth to Western comics, many of which began being published around 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoades, Shirrel (2008). &#39;&#39;A Complete History of American Comic Books&#39;&#39;. New York: Peter Lang Publishing, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schelly /&gt;\n\nMost of the larger publishers of the period jumped headfirst into the Western arena during this period, particularly [[Marvel Comics]] and its forerunners [[Timely Comics]] and [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]. &#39;&#39;[[Kid Colt Outlaw]]&#39;&#39; debuted in 1948, running until 1979 (though it was primarily a reprint title after 1967). The company soon established itself as the most prolific publisher of Western comics&lt;ref&gt;Markstein, Don. [http://www.toonopedia.com/twogun1.htm \&quot;Two-Gun Kid,\&quot;] Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia. Accessed Dec. 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; with other notable long-running titles, including &#39;&#39;[[Rawhide Kid]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Two-Gun Kid]]&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;[[Wild Western]]&#39;&#39;.\n\nThe six-issue 1950 [[Harvey Comics]] series &#39;&#39;[[Boys&#39; Ranch]]&#39;&#39;, by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], was a seminal example of the Western comics genre. [[DC Comics]] published the long-running series &#39;&#39;[[All-Star Western]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Western Comics]]&#39;&#39;. [[Charlton Comics]] published &#39;&#39;[[Billy the Kid (Charlton Comics)|Billy the Kid]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Cheyenne Kid&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Outlaws of the West&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Texas Rangers in Action&#39;&#39;, and the unusual title &#39;&#39;[[Black Fury (comics)|Black Fury]]&#39;&#39;, about a [[horse]] that roamed the West righting wrongs. Both [[Dell Comics]] and [[Fawcett Comics]] published a number of Western titles, including &#39;&#39;[[The Lone Ranger]]&#39;&#39; (Dell) and &#39;&#39;[[Hopalong Cassidy]]&#39;&#39; (Fawcett, later continued by DC after Fawcett folded in 1953). Many issues of Dell&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Four Color]]&#39;&#39; featured Western stories during the 1950s. [[Avon Comics]] published a number of Western comics, the most notable titles being based on historical figures like [[Jesse James]] and [[Wild Bill Hickok]]. [[Youthful (publisher)|Youthful]] published the Western titles &#39;&#39;Gunsmoke&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Indian Fighter&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;Redskin&#39;&#39; (later known as &#39;&#39;Famous Western Badmen&#39;&#39;). And [[Toby Press]] published its own &#39;&#39;[[Billy the Kid]] Adventure Magazine&#39;&#39;.\n\n=== Characters ===\nThe first Western hero to have his adventures published in the comics was the [[Masked Raider]], published by [[Timely Comics]] beginning in 1939.\n\nTimely/Atlas/Marvel favored Western characters with the word \&quot;Kid\&quot; in their name, including the [[Apache Kid (comics)|Apache Kid]], [[Kid Colt]], the [[Outlaw Kid]], the [[Rawhide Kid]], the [[Ringo Kid]], the [[Two-Gun Kid]], and the [[Western Kid]]\u2014as well as the more obscure heroes the Prairie Kid, the Arizona Kid, and the Texas Kid. Other companies followed suit, with DC&#39;s [[Stuff the Chinatown Kid]] and the [[Wyoming Kid]]; [[Charlton Comics]]&#39; [[Billy the Kid (Charlton Comics)|Billy the Kid]] and the Cheyenne Kid; and Dell&#39;s the [[Cisco Kid#Comics|Cisco Kid]].\n\n[[Black Rider (comics)|Black Rider]] and [[Phantom Rider]] were two other Marvel company characters from the genre&#39;s peak. Other early [[DC Comics]] Western characters included [[Johnny Thunder#John Tane|Johnny Thunder]], [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]], [[Pow Wow Smith]], [[Tomahawk (comics)|Tomahawk]], the [[Trigger Twins]], and [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]. [[Dell Comics]] featured the [[Lone Ranger]], and Dell&#39;s [[Lobo (Dell Comics)|Lobo]] (debuting in 1965) was the medium&#39;s first [[African-American]] character to headline his own series.\n\n==== Cowboy actor comics ====\nThe years 1946\u20131949 saw an explosion of titles \&quot;starring\&quot; Western film actors and cowboy singers. Almost every star, major or minor, had their own title at some point; and almost every publisher got in on the action: [[Fawcett Comics|Fawcett]] published [[Allan Lane]], [[Monte Hale]], [[Gabby Hayes]], [[Lash LaRue]], [[Tex Ritter]], and [[Tom Mix]] comics; Dell published [[Gene Autry]], [[Rex Allen]], [[Roy Rogers]], and [[Wild Bill Elliott]] comics; [[Magazine Enterprises]] published [[Charles Starrett]] and [[Tim Holt]] comics; [[Toby Press]] published a [[John Wayne]] title; and DC produced short-lived [[Dale Evans]] and [[Jimmy Wakely]] titles. (Dale Evans and [[Reno Browne]] were the only two Western actresses to have comics based on their characters.){{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Most of the cowboy actor titles featured photo covers of the stars; most series had been canceled by 1957.\n\n=== Creators ===\nSince Westerns were such a popular genre in the 1950s, many of the period&#39;s notable creators spent at least some time doing Western comics.\n\nWriter [[Paul S. Newman]] and artist [[Tom Gill (comics)|Tom Gill]] had an 11-year stretch on [[Dell Comics|Dell]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[The Lone Ranger]]&#39;&#39;, a 107-issue run that marks one of the longest of any writer/artist team on a comic-book series. [[Larry Lieber]] spent nine years as writer-artist of Marvel&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Rawhide Kid]]&#39;&#39;. [[France Herron]] and [[Fred Ray]] were the long-time writer and artist of DC&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Tomahawk (comics)|Tomahawk]]&#39;&#39;. [[Gaylord DuBois]] excelled in writing Western comics featuring realistic animals: he wrote the entire run of &#39;&#39;[[Silver (horse)|The Lone Ranger&#39;s Famous Horse Hi-Yo Silver]]&#39;&#39;, the entire run of &#39;&#39;[[National Velvet]]&#39;&#39; under both the Dell and Gold Key imprints, and many other animal stories for a number of publishers.\n\n[[Carl Pfeufer]] was the longtime artist of Fawcett&#39;s [[Tom Mix]] comics. Artist [[Fred Guardineer]] had a long run on [[Magazine Enterprises]]&#39; &#39;&#39;The [[Durango Kid]]&#39;&#39;. [[Pete Tumlinson]] illustrated most of [[Kid Colt]]&#39;s early stories. Later, Tumlinson drew Western stories for [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]&#39; &#39;&#39;Outlaw Fighters&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Two-Gun Western&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;[[Wild Western]]&#39;&#39;. [[Russ Heath]] drew a corral-full of Western stories for such Marvel titles as &#39;&#39;[[Wild Western]],&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;All Western Winners,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Arizona Kid,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;[[Black Rider (comics)|Black Rider]],&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Western Outlaws,&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Reno Browne, Hollywood&#39;s Greatest Cowgirl.&#39;&#39; [[Vic Carrabotta]] worked on such Marvel Westerns as &#39;&#39;[[Apache Kid (comics)|Apache Kid]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Kid Colt: Outlaw]]&#39;&#39;, [[The Outlaw Kid]], and &#39;&#39;Western Outlaws&#39;&#39;. Artist [[John Severin]] was known for his 1950s Western comics art for Atlas. Artist [[Mike Sekowsky]] drew such characters as the [[Apache Kid (comics)|Apache Kid]], the [[Black Rider (comics)|Black Rider]], and [[Kid Colt]] for Atlas; he later freelanced for other companies, drawing the [[TV-series]] spin-offs &#39;&#39;[[Gunsmoke]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Buffalo Bill, Jr.]]&#39;&#39; for [[Dell Comics]].\n\nArtist [[Rocke Mastroserio]] specialized in Western stories for such [[Charlton Comics]] series as &#39;&#39;[[Billy the Kid (Charlton Comics)|Billy the Kid]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Black Fury (comics)|Black Fury]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Jim Bowie]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Rocky Lane&#39;s Black Jack&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Sheriff of [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Six-Gun Heroes&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in Action&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;[[Wyatt Earp]], Frontier Marshal&#39;&#39;. [[Pat Boyette]] worked on such Charlton Western series as &#39;&#39;[[Billy the Kid (Charlton Comics)|Billy the Kid]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Cheyenne Kid&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;Outlaws of the West&#39;&#39;.\n\n== 1960s decline ==\nThe Western genre in general peaked around 1960, largely due to the tremendous number of Westerns on American [[television]].{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Increasingly, the genre reflected a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] view of the American West\u2014and American history in general. As the country grappled with the cultural issues of the 1960s and the [[Vietnam War]], the genre seemed increasingly out of touch.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAs the [[United States|American]] public&#39;s interest in the genre waned, Western literature\u2014including comics\u2014began to lose its appeal as well. At the same time, the comics industry was shifting back to superheroes (entering its \&quot;[[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]]\&quot;) and away from some of the other genres which had flourished during the 1950s. In fact, of the original Western comics series begun in the late 1940s and early 1950s, only a handful of titles survived the 1950s. Charlton&#39;s low production costs enabled it to continue producing a number of Western titles, but otherwise Dell&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[The Lone Ranger]]&#39;&#39;, and Marvel&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Gunsmoke Western]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Kid Colt Outlaw]]&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;[[Rawhide Kid]]&#39;&#39; were the only Western titles to make it through the 1960s.\n\n[[Gary Friedrich]], [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]], and [[Ogden Whitney]] are three of the few notable Western comics creators from the 1960s.\n\n== Weird West and continuing appeal ==\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s saw the rise of [[revisionist Western]] film. Elements include a darker, more cynical tone, with focus on the lawlessness of the time period, favoring realism over romanticism, and an interest in greater historical authenticity. Anti-heroes were common, as were stronger roles for women and more-sympathetic portrayal of Native Americans and Mexicans. The films were often critical of big business, the American government, and masculine figures (including the military and their policies).\n\nReflecting the trend, in 1968 DC debuted the new character [[Bat Lash]], who starred in a short-lived series. They also revived the &#39;&#39;[[All-Star Western]]&#39;&#39; title, starting volume two of the series in 1970. In 1972, &#39;&#39;All-Star Western&#39;&#39; changed its name to &#39;&#39;[[Weird Western Tales]]&#39;&#39;, with many stories featuring the newly created Western antihero [[Jonah Hex]] (debuting in 1975 in his own title). &#39;&#39;Weird Western Tales&#39;&#39; (sister title of &#39;&#39;[[Weird War Tales]]&#39;&#39;) defined a new [[multi-genre]] form: \&quot;[[Weird West]],\&quot; a combination of the Western with another literary genre, usually [[Horror comics|horror]], [[occult]], or [[Fantasy comics|fantasy]]. Other Western characters DC created during this period include the heroes [[Scalphunter (DC Comics)|Scalphunter]] and [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]], and the villains [[El Papagayo]], [[Terra-Man]], and [[Quentin Turnbull]].\n\nMarvel also attempted to capitalize on the renewed interest in the Western with two mostly reprint titles, &#39;&#39;[[The Mighty Marvel Western]]&#39;&#39; (1968\u20131976) and &#39;&#39;[[Western Gunfighters]]&#39;&#39; vol. 2 (1970\u20131975).\n\nThe short-lived publisher [[Skywald Publications]] attempted a line of Western titles in the early 1970s, but nothing came of it.\n\n&#39;&#39;Weird Western Tales&#39;&#39; survived until 1980, and &#39;&#39;Jonah Hex&#39;&#39; until 1985. By then no major publishers were producing Western titles, though iconic characters from the DC and Marvel canons would occasionally make cameo appearances in other books.\n\nThe [[DC Comics]] imprint [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] reintroduced the Western genre in 1995 with &#39;&#39;[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]&#39;&#39;, set in a contemporary version of the West. In the 1990s and 2000s, the Western comic leaned toward the Weird West subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period, from &#39;&#39;[[Jonah Hex]]&#39;&#39; to &#39;&#39;[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]&#39;&#39;. Series like &#39;&#39;[[Desperadoes (comics)|Desperadoes]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[High Moon]]&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;[[Scalped]]&#39;&#39; demonstrate the genre&#39;s continuing appeal. Creators like [[Joe R. Lansdale]], [[Michael Fleisher]], and [[Tony DeZuniga]] were notable contributors to Western comics from this period.\n\nIn addition, publishers like [[America&#39;s Comics Group]] and [[AC Comics]] have reprinted a number of Western comics from the genre&#39;s \&quot;Golden Age.\&quot;\n\n&#39;&#39;[[The Goodbye Family]]&#39;&#39;, about a family of Weird West undertakers, started in 2015 and continues in both online and print formats.\n\n== Outside of the United States ==\nThe Western genre&#39;s overall popularity in Europe spawned a Western comics trend, particularly in [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], and [[England]]. Many European countries published reprints of American-made Western comics (translated into the respective country&#39;s native language). The Italian publishers [[Sergio Bonelli Editore]] and Editorial Novaro led the field\u2014Editorial Novaro&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Gene Autry]]&#39;&#39; title ran 424 issues from 1954\u20131984. The Norwegian publisher Se-Bladene and the British publisher [[L. Miller &amp; Son]] were also particularly known for their Western comics reprint titles. Se-Bladene&#39;s &#39;&#39;Texas&#39;&#39; ran 606 issues between 1954\u20131975. The [[Comics in Australia|Australian publishers]] Ayers &amp; James, Cleland, Federal Publishing, Gredown, and [[Horwitz Publications]] all published reprints of American Western comics during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n=== Italy ===\nThe most popular and long-running Italian-produced Western comic is [[Gian Luigi Bonelli]] and [[Aurelio Galleppini]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;Tex&#39;&#39; (starring [[Tex Willer]]), first published in 1948. &#39;&#39;Tex&#39;&#39; is among the most popular characters in Italian comics, and has been translated into numerous languages, including [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]],Tamil, [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Slovene language|Slovenian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Hebrew]].\n\n&#39;&#39;[[Captain Miki]]&#39;&#39;, by the trio [[EsseGesse]], was published in [[Italy]] (and translated into many other languages) throughout the 1950s. Characters in the comic were inspired by [[Gabby Hayes]] and the popular 1939 Western film &#39;&#39;[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]&#39;&#39;. EsseGesse also produced the popular series &#39;&#39;[[Il Grande Blek]]&#39;&#39;. [[Benito Jacovitti]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Cocco Bill]]&#39;&#39; is a Western humor comic produced since the mid-1950s.\n\n[[Sergio Bonelli]] and [[Gallieno Ferri]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Zagor]]&#39;&#39; was first published in Italy by [[Sergio Bonelli Editore]] in 1961. [[Carlo Boscarato]] and [[Claudio Nizzi]]&#39;s [[Larry Yuma]] was a popular character in the Italian magazine &#39;&#39;[[Il Giornalino]]&#39;&#39; throughout the 1970s. [[Giancarlo Berardi]] and [[Ivo Milazzo]]&#39;s [[Ken Parker (character)|Ken Parker]] is a popular Western hero appearing in Italian comics since 1977.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, writer Gianfranco Manfredi&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Magico Vento]]&#39;&#39; was a popular title from [[Sergio Bonelli Editore]]. Since the late 1990s, Enrico Teodorani&#39;s [[Djustine]] has been featured in erotic \&quot;[[Weird West]]\&quot; stories in Italy and the United States.\n\n=== Franco-Belgian Western comics ===\nThe Western humor comic &#39;&#39;[[Lucky Luke]]&#39;&#39;, published since 1946, debuting in &#39;&#39;[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]&#39;&#39; magazine, is one of the most popular and best-selling comics series in continental Europe. Popular in Canada, about half of the series&#39; adventures have been translated into English. &#39;&#39;Lucky Luke&#39;&#39; comics have been translated into 23 languages, including many European languages, and some African and Asian languages.\n\n&#39;&#39;[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]&#39;&#39; magazine featured Western-themed comics starting in 1947 with [[Le Rallic]]&#39;s various series, and later, between 1955 and 1980 the humor-based [[Chick Bill]] by [[Greg (comics)|Greg]] and [[Tibet (comics)|Tibet]]. The competing magazine &#39;&#39;Spirou&#39;&#39; published [[Jij\u00e9]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Jerry Spring]]&#39;&#39;, in a realistic vein, beginning in 1954. Albums from the &#39;&#39;Jerry Spring&#39;&#39; series were published until 1990.\n\n[[Jean-Michel Charlier]] and [[Jean Giraud]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]&#39;&#39; is a Western series published beginning in 1963 and continuing until 2005. The series were inspired by &#39;&#39;Jerry Spring&#39;&#39;, and the artist Giraud had been mentored by [[Jij\u00e9]]. Charlier and Giraud created the &#39;&#39;[[Jim Cutlass]]&#39;&#39; series in 1981; subsequent volumes were written by Giraud and drawn by [[Christian Rossi]].\n\nGreg and [[Hermann Huppen]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Comanche (comic book series)|Comanche]]&#39;&#39; was published from 1972\u20131983 (with the series being continued by Rouge for four more stories). The Belgian publisher [[Le Lombard]] produced the title &#39;&#39;[[Buddy Longway]]&#39;&#39;, by Swiss comics creator [[Derib]], from 1972\u20131987, and from 2002\u20132006.\n\nDurango is a western series created by the belgian Yves Swolfs in 1981. Currently 17 tomes are available.\n\n=== Other countries ===\nEngland&#39;s [[L. Miller &amp; Son]]&#39;s original Western comics titles included &#39;&#39;Colorado Kid&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Davy Crockett]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Kid Dynamite Western Comic&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Pancho Villa]] Western Comic&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;Rocky Mountain King Western Comic&#39;&#39;, all published in the 1950s. Jim Edgar and [[Tony Weare]]&#39;s \&quot;Matt Marriott\&quot; was a daily strip which ran in the &#39;&#39;[[London Evening News]]&#39;&#39; from 1955 to 1977.\n\nSpanish cartoonist Manuel Gago Garcia&#39;s &#39;&#39;The Little Fighter&#39;&#39; was a popular series of Western comics between 1945 and 1956. &#39;&#39;Yuki the Bold&#39;&#39; (debuting in 1958) is another popular Spanish series, as were the shorter-lived series &#39;&#39;Apache&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Red Arrow&#39;&#39;. Other Spanish Western comics include &#39;&#39;Sheriff King&#39;&#39; (beginning in 1964), &#39;&#39;Sunday&#39;&#39; (1968), and &#39;&#39;Kelly Hand&#39;&#39; (1971).\n\n[[Hugo Pratt]] and [[H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Sergeant Kirk]]&#39;&#39; was a popular Western comics title in Argentina during the 1950s. Additional Sergeant Kirk stories were published into the early 1970s.\n\nWestern comics were popular in Japan in the early 1950s, both translations of American titles like &#39;&#39;[[Straight Arrow]]&#39;&#39;, the [[Durango Kid]], and [[Tim Holt]]; and original Japanese [[manga]]. The story goes that during the American occupation of Japan directly after World War, General Eisenhower forbade Japanese publishers to publish [[samurai]] comics, and that the next best thing were Western stories of adventure.&lt;ref&gt;FALK, RAY.
