== Fictional character biography ==
Mad Harriet is raised in Granny Goodness's orphanage. A deeply disturbed child, she impresses Granny with her ferocious temper and penchant for violence, and she inducts the girl into the Female Furies. In this capacity, Mad Harriet serves Darkseid. During the battle with the Earth-based Suicide Squad over the fate of Glorious Godfrey, Harriet is almost killed when she attacks the Bronze Tiger and her energy claws backfire.
During another mission, Harriet is captured by the Gods of New Genesis but is sent back to Darkseid. Later, Mad Harriet is seen as a prostitute in Granny Goodness' brothel, though it is left ambiguous as to whether this is the real Mad Harriet or a delusion by the second Mister Miracle. She also befriends fellow criminal Harley Quinn, though Bernadeth later scolds her for associating with a mortal.
Mad Harriet reappeared with the rest of the Female Furies as they battled Firestorm, Orion, and Hawkgirl on separate occasions.
In Countdown #11, Mad Harriet was part of the battle against Mary Marvel, Harley Quinn and the second Catwoman. As Apokolips' Dog Soldiers open fired on Mary, she ducked and the bullets shredded Mad Harriet instead. 
In Final Crisis, Mad Harriet was one of the Furies whose spirit possessed some of Earth's heroines and villainess. Her vessel was Batwoman.

After Lex Luthor claimed leadership of Apokolips, Mad Harriet joined Granny Goodness and the other Female Furies in the deadlands, awaiting Darkseid's return. She later participated in the battle against Kalibak's forces, though she was eventually defeated by her teammate Lois Lane after the Furies turned on the human when she revealed her relationship with Superman. Mad Harriet was imprisoned on Apokolips with Lashina, Stompa, and Granny Goodness when Superman became ruler of the planet.At some point later, Mad Harriet and her comrades were freed from their imprisonment by Darkseid, who had been slowly regaining his power on Earth. Along with the other Female Furies, Mad Harriet was assigned to seek out mystical artifacts that would further empower Darkseid. Steve Trevor and his team of soldiers called the Oddfellows prevented Mad Harriet and the Furies from stealing the relics, and in the ensuing battle Harriet, along with Lashina, was captured. Both Lashina and Mad Harriet refused to answer Wonder Woman's questions about Darkseid's plans which led to Wonder Woman freeing the two Furies and attempting to battle them for answers. The battle was interrupted by Darkseid, who had transported a chunk of the A.R.G.U.S. headquarters to his lair in the Amazon jungle. During the chaos, Mad Harriet battled the soldiers of A.R.G.U.S. and later fled when Darkseid was apparently killed by Wonder Woman.During the escalation of the war between Apokolips and New Genesis, Mad Harriet attended the birth of Jacob, the son of Big Barda and Mister Miracle. She also participated in the war against New Genesis.

Like a member of The Female Furies, Mad Harriet is superhumanly strong equal that her partners Lashina or Bernadeth. Her advanced physiology makes her extremely long-lived and immune to all diseases. Mad Harriet possesses a remarkable agility and flexibility above the other Female Furies. Due to the fact she is extremely insane, Harriet has a wild fighting style.
Mad Harriet wears "power spikes" on her hands that crackle with energy. They can cause enough damage to harm even the most powerful metahumans of the DC universe.
