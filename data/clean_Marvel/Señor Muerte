Ramon was the owner of a chain of gambling casinos, and a criminal who called himself \"Se\u00f1or Suerte\" (which means \"Mr. Luck\" in English) in his role as head of criminal gambling operations in New York.  He used the name \"Se\u00f1or Muerte\" (which means \"Mr. Death\" in English) when he killed his opponents.\nRamon sent men to kill Frank Jenks and Luke Cage.  Muerte attempted to kill Luke Cage, and murdered a rival casino owner. He battled Cage, but was electrocuted by his own device during the battle and died.Ramon reappears without explanation years later, being forced to commit crimes by Lady Caterpillar, who had abducted his wife, Rebecca Clyde.\n\n\n== Jaime and Phillip ==\nAfter Ramon's death, his younger brothers Jaime and Phillip took over his operations, and became the co-owners of their brother's gambling casinos. Jaime became \"Se\u00f1or Suerte\" and Phillip became \"Se\u00f1or Muerte\". Jaime was a professional thief, and Phillip was a professional assassin.\nPhillip, as the new Se\u00f1or Muerte, posed as his deceased brother Ramon. Alongside the Tarantula, he murdered government agent Ken Astor, and attempted to hijack a military convoy, the Madbombs. He battled Captain America. Phillip wore gloves that were able to release spider venom into his victims.\nJaime, as Se\u00f1or Suerte, attempted a theft of Tutankhamen artifacts from a museum, and battled Cage and Iron Fist.

He used an assortment of knives, high-powered handguns, hand grenades, and flame-throwers concealed in the specially designed pockets of the coat and vest he usually wore.
