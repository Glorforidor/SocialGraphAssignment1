They are adversaries of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; They first appeared as adults in &#39;&#39;[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]&#39;&#39; #147 (Aug 1961) and as teens in &#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39; #372 (Sept 1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=203-204}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe team originated at a time when &#39;&#39;[[Superman]]&#39;&#39; editor [[Mort Weisinger]] was consciously adding new elements to the \&quot;Superman mythos\&quot; over a period of years, building an extended cast of supporting characters who could provide new story opportunities. The creation of the Legion of Super-Heroes was part of that plan, and in the Legion&#39;s fourth appearance (\&quot;The Army of Living Kryptonite Men\&quot; in &#39;&#39;[[Superboy (comic book)|Superboy]]&#39;&#39; #86, Jan 1961), there&#39;s a suggestion that [[Lex Luthor]] would someday lead a group of super-villains.&lt;ref name=Krypton&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |title=The Krypton Companion |date=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781893905610 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven months later, in &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #147&#39;s story \&quot;The Legion of Super-Villains\&quot;, that prediction came true.&lt;ref name=Krypton/&gt;\n\n==Fictional team history==&lt;!--needs expanding to include the adult Legion of Super-Villains--&gt;\nPre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39;, the Legion first appears when [[Lex Luthor]] creates a radio to contact the future, hoping to send a message to a Legion of Super-Villains, feeling there must be an evil counterpart to the Legion of Super-Heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume Three: Superman |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=1-4012-1389-8 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is broken out of jail by a gun, flying belt, and force-field helmet being sent into his cell. He then meets the trio of villains, [[Cosmic King]], Lightning Lord and [[Saturn Queen]], who tell him of their origins. They cause trouble for Superman and finally an illusion cast by Saturn Queen succeeds in luring him to a planetoid, where a Kryptonite field holds him. He is told the origins of the LSV, and sentenced to death in a parody of the way the Legion of Super-Heroes voted him in, but the adult Legion of Super-Heroes appears and battles their foes. Luthor threatens to kill Superman, but [[Saturn Girl|Saturn Woman]] offers herself in his place. Superman asks for a tribute to her and is released after promising not to rescue her. He uses part of [[Saturn]]&#39;s rings to create a ring round the planetoid, causing Saturn Queen to hypnotize the villains before they can kill Saturn Woman, as it is revealed Saturn&#39;s rings somehow make the inhabitants stay good. Saturn Queen is given a fragment to make sure she stays good, and the other villains are jailed. However, they would battle Superman at other points, such as during &#39;&#39;[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]&#39;&#39;, where they aid Brainiac in assaulting Superman at his Fortress of Solitude. They also kill Lana Lang, before fleeing back to the future when Superman brutally attacks Lightning Lord.\n\nPre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39;, the Legion of Super-Villains was founded by Tarik the Mute, who had suffered irreparable damage to his vocal cords during a battle with the [[Science Police]] and subsequently developed a pathological hatred of law and order.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} He founded a [[school]] for supervillains, which served as the headquarters and recruiting grounds for the Legion&#39;s first incarnation.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} He blackmailed [[Colossal Boy]] into joining as a teacher.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\nSeveral other incarnations of the group formed over the years, led first by Sun Emperor and then by [[Nemesis Kid]].{{Issue|date=October 2009}} In the last incarnation they conquered the low-tech planet of [[Orando]], the homeworld of [[Princess Projectra]], and slipped it into another dimension as a base of operations.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} Each villain was sworn to kill one Legionnaire, but only Nemesis Kid succeeded, fatally wounding [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]].{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn Post-&#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]&#39;&#39; continuity, some of the members of the Legion of Super-Villains attempted to remake the universe by tampering with the origins of [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] and adopting them as their own \&quot;children\&quot;, eventually transforming them into the dictators of Earth, and eliminating other members of the [[Justice League|JLA]] to stop them from interfering. Superman and Batman managed to overcome their brainwashing, however, due to the [[Darkseid]] of another reality telling them what had happened; they restored the timestream to its proper course, and took the villains to the 31st century to be imprisoned, but kept the memories of their lives with the villains.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman/Batman&#39;&#39; #14-18 (January\u2013April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Five Years Later===\nDuring the fourth volume of &#39;&#39;Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39;, the Legion of Super-Villains has disbanded, and some of its members had actually reformed. Echo joined the Legion during the Five Year Gap, but resigned after the events of Black Dawn.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #28 (April 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Lightning Lord reformed and went to work on his family&#39;s plantation on [[Winath]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #3 (January 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Ron-Karr joined the [[Legion of Substitute Heroes]]&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #16 (March 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and Spider Girl joined the Legion,&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceB\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #54 (February 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; nursing some feelings for [[Ultra Boy|Jo Nah]] and changing her identity to \&quot;Wave\&quot; when the Legion went on the run.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceB\&quot;/&gt; Saturn Queen married [[Matter-Eater Lad]] and reformed after retrieving her family&#39;s hypno-stone from [[Prince Evillo]], ultimately becoming queen of Titan.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #50 (Late November 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation Roy, however, was kidnapped by the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominator]]-controlled Earthgov and almost [[mindwipe]]d as a soldier for the Dominion.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #27 (March 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; These events were all wiped out by &#39;&#39;[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #62 (November 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The Lightning Saga===\nManifestations of the LSV based on the nightmares of [[Nura Nal|Dream Girl]] appeared at the end of &#39;&#39;[[Justice Society of America]]&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #4 (2007), where they kill the guards of [[Arkham Asylum]].\n\n===Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes===\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39; #859 (2008), Spider Girl and Radiation Roy are shown to be members of the xenophobic &#39;&#39;[[Justice League]] of Earth&#39;&#39;, along with other rejected [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] applicants [[Kirt Niedrigh|Earth Man]] (formerly Absorbency Boy), Eyeful Ethel, Tusker, Golden Boy, and Storm Boy. Spider Girl is now in a relationship with Earth-Man, the League&#39;s leader, and traded the Legionnaire [[White Witch (comics)|White Witch]] to [[Mordru]], in return for his staying off the planet. Roy now has to wear a containment suit, since his radioactive powers have caused him to develop [[tumor]]s all over his body, specifically one dominating the right side of his face. Defeated by [[Superman]] and the Legionnaires, the Justice Leaguers are sent to the prison planet Takron-Galtos.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds}}\nThe Legion of Super-Villains appear in the &#39;&#39;[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]&#39;&#39; [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] which runs from August 2008 to September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dccomics.com/dcu/comics/?cm=11273 |title=&#39;&#39;Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds&#39;&#39; #5 (of 5) |accessdate=2008-12-16 |work=DC Comics.com |date=December 15, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226075019/http://dccomics.com/dcu/comics/?cm=11273 |archivedate=December 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This incarnation of the Legion includes Lightning Lord, [[Saturn Queen]], [[Cosmic King]], Sun Emperor, Beauty Blaze, Ol-Vir, [[Tyr (DC Comics)|Tyr]], Zymyr, [[Hunter (comics)|Hunter]], and Chameleon Chief as well as other Legion of Super-Heroes villains Black Mace, [[Universo]], Dr. Regulus, [[Grimbor the Chainsman]], [[Mordru]], [[Esper Lass]], Magno Lad, [[Micro Lad]], Echo, Terrus, the League of Super-Assassins (Silver Slasher, Lazon, Neutrax, Mist Master, and Titania), the [[Fatal Five]] ([[Tharok]], [[Emerald Empress]], [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]], [[Mano (comics)|Mano]], and [[Validus]]), and the [[Justice League of Earth]] ([[Radiation Roy]], Tusker, [[Spider Girl]], Golden Boy, [[List of Legion of Super-Heroes members#Joined during the \&quot;Five Year Gap\&quot;|Storm Boy]], and [[Kirt Niedrigh|Earth-Man]]).

The Legion of Super-Villains later appear on Sorcerer&#39;s World as Mordru is trying to stop [[Dawnstar]], [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]], [[Blok (comics)|Blok]], and [[Green Lantern]]/Legionnaire Rond Vidar from rescuing the [[White Witch (comics)|White Witch]]. The White Witch manages to create a stargate, but Rond forces them through and is left to fight the Legion by himself. After Vidar has fought off several Legion members, Saturn Queen gets inside his head and starts to hinder his willpower. When Prime grabs Rond by the neck, Saturn Queen tells him to wait, since Rond is Universo&#39;s son. Universo shows no care for Rond and only wants his power ring. Rond mocks him, telling him it can never be his, and spits in his face before Prime snaps his neck. Universo tries to take his ring, but it flies off to [[Oa]]. Mordru is then offered membership in the Legion, telling him it can only be temporary, which is the same case for the Fatal Five and the Justice League of Earth. Earth Man sums it up by saying that, as much as the various villains dislike each other, they all want the Legion of Super-Heroes dead. They head for Earth and launch an attack on the Legionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&#39;&#39; #2 (November 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the tide turns against them as the White Witch uses Mordru&#39;s spell \&quot;Aufero magus infusco!\&quot; three times to absorb Mordru and his magic.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceA\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&#39;&#39; #5 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Post-&#39;&#39;Legion of Three Worlds&#39;&#39;===\nIn &#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #3 (2009), it was revealed that the Legion of Super-Villains has sent an espionage squad back into the 21st century.\n\nIt has also been revealed that [[Saturn Queen]] has been reforming the group in order to bring anarchy back to the universe, starting with the destruction of the worlds that house the immortal beings that represent will ([[Oa]]), faith (the [[Rock of Eternity]]), and wisdom (Utopia, the World of the Wise, homeworld of supporting character Harmonia Li).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39; #15, released July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Roster==\nThe members of the Legion included:&lt;!--either needs to be deleted or merged with the villain roster shown in the Infobox--&gt;\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Akka&#39;&#39;&#39; - Expert martial artist from the planet Sklar.

The lineup consists of Lightning Lord (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]), Hunter (voiced by [[Khary Payton]]), Esper (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]), Tyr (voiced by [[Khary Payton]]), Wave, and Ron-Karr (voiced by [[Shawn Harrison (actor)|Shawn Harrison]] with the character depicted as a shapeshifter). This version is primarily led by Lightning Lord. Calling themselves the \&quot;Light Speed Vanguard\&quot; they pretend to be superheroes and attempt to outperform the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. However, they are soon revealed to be financially motivated protector-extortionists and assassins. The team, minus Lightning Lord, return at the beginning of Season 2 assisting the Fatal Five. Now led exclusively by Tyr in the absence of Lightning Lord, they appear as one of several teams of villains released from prison by [[Imperiex]]. In that same episode, [[Brainiac 5]] later refers to them officially as the Legion of Super-Villains.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cosmicteams.com/legion/docs/lsv.htm Cosmic Teams profile]\n* [http://www.dragonhero.com/lsh/villains.html Dragon Hero.com profile]\n* [http://www.readersadvice.com/lsh/lshaltb4.html#B.4.00.
