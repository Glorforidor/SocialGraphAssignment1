Created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], they appeared in their own self-titled feature which ran from &#39;&#39;[[Star-Spangled Comics]]&#39;&#39; #7 (April 1942)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 41 |quote = Joe Simon and Jack Kirby took their talents to a second title with &#39;&#39;Star-Spangled Comics&#39;&#39;, tackling both the Guardian and the Newsboy Legion in issue #7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to #64 (January 1947). In 1970, [[Jack Kirby]] introduced a new Newsboy Legion, made up of the sons of the original [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] characters.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Pre-Crisis version===\nThe Newsboy Legion is a group of orphans, living on the streets of [[Suicide Slum]], selling newspapers to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=282-283}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also frequently in trouble with the law, although local policeman Jim Harper had a soft spot for them. In their first appearance, Harper, shortly after becoming [[Guardian (DC Comics)|the Guardian]], also becomes the Newsboys&#39; legal guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring theme in their stories was that the boys suspected Harper was the Guardian but were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/gnewsboy.htm |title=The Newsboy Legion}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Newsboy Legion consisted of Tommy Tompkins (the leader); Big Words (the team genius);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Roy |title=The All-Star Companion: Vol 2 |date=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1893905375 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabby (an excitable kid who never stopped talking); and Scrapper (the tough guy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent |url-access=registration |accessdate=8 April 2020 |page=[https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/184 184]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Newsboy Legion were reintroduced in &#39;&#39;[[Superman&#39;s Pal Jimmy Olsen (comic)|Superman&#39;s Pal Jimmy Olsen]]&#39;&#39; #133  (October 1970) as part of [[Jack Kirby&#39;s Fourth World]] story arc. The Legion in that story were the sons of the originals, who were now working at a government [[genetics]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2010 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0-7566-6742-9 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new addition to the team was Walter \&quot;Flipper Dipper\&quot; (or \&quot;Flippa Dippa\&quot;) Johnson Jr., an [[African-American]] boy. He was obsessed with and very capable of underwater maneuvers. He is also the son of another member of the Project. His nickname was later shortened to \&quot;Flip\&quot;.\n\nDuring their first mission, the villainous [[Morgan Edge]] develops the Whiz Wagon for the unsuspecting boys.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=473}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempts to use it and them (and by extension, [[Jimmy Olsen]]) to kill the Hairies, an underground, technologically advanced society. The Hairies were literally neighbors of the Project and both were near the Evil Factory, which strove to destroy the others. Assisting the Legion in fighting the Factory was a clone of Scrapper called &#39;Scrapper Trooper&#39;, who was designed for military support of the Project. &lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;s Pal, Jimmy Olsen&#39;&#39; #146 (Feb. 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe boys would become affected by the Project in other ways; such as befriending an experiment from the &#39;Evil Factory&#39;. They called this large, pink, humanoid entity &#39;Angry Charlie&#39;. He was the only survivor from the Factory. The police authorities from Scotland, where the Factory had been hiding, allowed the Legion to maintain custody of the entity.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;s Pal, Jimmy Olsen&#39;&#39; #145 (Jan. 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Post-Crisis version===\n[[File:Newsboy Legion - Superman - Funeral for a Friend.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the Newsboy Legion as drawn in Superman - Funeral for a Friend]]\n\nPost-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]], the Newsboy Legion&#39;s 1940s history was unchanged, as was their later involvement with the DNA Project (now called [[Project Cadmus]]). Instead of having identical sons, however, the new Newsboy Legion were now said to be [[cloning|clone]]s, created by the same technology that recreated the Guardian, as part of an [[Apokolips]] plot that went wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Guardian clone, they shared their \&quot;father&#39;s\&quot; memories, at least up to their current age, meaning that they were sometimes unfamiliar with the modern world (the new Flip&#39;s memories dated from the fifties, rather than the forties). They first appeared in this form in &#39;&#39;Superman Annual&#39;&#39; #2 (1988), written by [[Roger Stern]], and were extensively featured in [[Karl Kesel]]&#39;s run on &#39;&#39;[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]&#39;&#39;, including breaking [[Superboy (modern)|Kon-El]] out of Cadmus. The clones were always getting into trouble, such as when they hid the existence of a large monster that ate furniture.\n\nThe post-Crisis Newsboys were also given real names: Big Words was Anthony  Rodriguez; Gabby was Johnny Gabrielli and Scrapper was Patrick  MacGuire.\nThey were briefly joined by the Guardian&#39;s niece \&quot;Famous\&quot; Bobby Harper, but she subsequently went to stay with another relative.\n\nThe Legion rebel against Cadmus for the first time when they the adults have stolen Superman&#39;s body. They join with an infiltration team composed of Lois Lane and several super-powered &#39;Underworlders&#39;, a Metropolis faction devoted to Superman. The group fails to regain Superman&#39;s body.&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Superman The Man Of Steel\&quot; (March 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe incident with Harper involved the Legion taking down an operation run by [[Granny Goodness]]; an orphanage that was a secret kidnapping ring for the dark realm of [[Apokolips]].&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Guardians Of Metropolis\&quot; #1 (November 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBoth versions of the Legion would deal with adversaries such as the insane scientist Dabney Donovan and lackeys of [[Darkseid]]. The Cadmus project entire would deal with attacks and manipulation from [[Lex Luthor]]&#39;s forces.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]&#39;&#39; #56, significant changes in Project Cadmus meant the Newsboys, original and clones, left the Project. It was briefly suggested that the clones were investigating what was really behind these changes, but this was not followed up on.\n\nThe Newsboy clones rescued Jimmy from the sewers beneath the project in &#39;&#39;[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]&#39;&#39; #29 (October 2007), following his breakout from Cadmus. They allowed Jimmy to stay in the \&quot;Legion Clubhouse\&quot; (a boarded-up storefront) while he tried to resolve his situation, but he was kidnapped by the second [[Forager (comics)|Forager]] (&#39;&#39;Countdown&#39;&#39; #28). Their \&quot;fathers\&quot; were not mentioned.\n\nThe group appears in issue one of &#39;&#39;[[Death of the New Gods]]&#39;&#39; (Dec 2007). Using the Whiz Wagon&#39;s computers, they assist Jimmy in gaining photographic evidence of the death of the &#39;&#39;Black Racer&#39;&#39;.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&#39;&#39; (one-shot, Dec 2008), the original Newsboy Legion members were killed by [[Codename: Assassin]]. The fate of the clones remains unknown. This was part of a long-reaching conspiracy to kill all Kryptonian beings of power, of which there were many at the time. The man in charge of this plot was United States General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Superman&#39;s Pal, Jimmy Olsen\&quot; (vol. 2) #1-2 (Nov-Dec 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn September 1944, the Newsboy Legion teamed up with the Boy Commandos to stop armed and armored traitors based out of New York City. &lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Newsboy Legion Boy Commandos Special\&quot; (October 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Seven Soldiers version===\nIn [[Grant Morrison]]&#39;s new take on the Guardian in &#39;&#39;[[Seven Soldiers]]: [[Manhattan Guardian|The Guardian]]&#39;&#39;, the &#39;&#39;Manhattan Guardian&#39;&#39; newspaper has a citywide network of volunteer reporters called the \&quot;Newsboy Army\&quot;.\n\nLater in that same series it was revealed that a group called the Newsboy Army was active during the forties in an area of New York called Nowhere Street. This group consisted of Captain 7 (an African-American boy in a football uniform), Ali Ka-Zoom (a young stage magician), Vincenzo &#39;Kid Scarface&#39; Baldi (an Italian boy in an impeccable suit), Chop Suzi (an Asian girl, the team&#39;s mechanic), Edward &#39;Baby Brain&#39; Stargard (an infant prodigy), Little Miss Hollywood (an impressionist, the daughter of Irish immigrants) and Millions (the world&#39;s richest dog). In their final mission as a team, they are cursed by the Terrible Time Tailor to be given horrible fates to prevent them from stopping his plans for the Harrowing.\n\nMillions \&quot;dies\&quot; shortly thereafter. It is widely assumed that Cap impregnates Suzi, as his designation after the encounter with the Terrible Time Tailor is \&quot;child molester\&quot;. However, the crossword puzzle included in &#39;&#39;Seven Soldiers&#39;&#39; #1 implies that Suzi may have given birth to twins, fathered by Baby Brain - despite obvious physical obstacles. Cap is subsequently killed by the others. Hollywood becomes an alcoholic &#39;super-impressionist&#39;. Ali Ka-Zoom masters genuine magic, goes mad, and dies, and Kid Scarface became Vincenzo the Undying Don, the leader of the L.A. underworld and is killed by the [[Sheeda]]. Baby Brain survives to found the Manhattan Guardian newspaper. Ali Ka-Zoom has shown up alive in &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39;. In &#39;&#39;Seven Soldiers&#39;&#39; #1, it is revealed that Kid Scarface/Don Vincenzo actually bathed Millions in the Cauldron of Rebirth, and Millions inherited all of Vincenzo&#39;s property after his death, becoming the \&quot;Dogfather\&quot;.\n\nThe name \&quot;Newsboys of Nowhere Street\&quot; suggests both the Newsboy Legion and Kirby&#39;s later kid gang, the [[Dingbats of Danger Street]].\n\n===Doc Savage===\nBig Words&#39; favorite expression of surprise is \&quot;I&#39;ll be superamalgamated!\&quot; This phrase was originally used by the similarly polysyllabic [[William Harper Littlejohn]] in &#39;&#39;[[Doc Savage]]&#39;&#39;.\n\n==Collections==\nDC has published two hardback collections:\n* &#39;&#39;The Newsboy Legion&#39;&#39; v1, 2010, {{ISBN|1-4012-2593-4}} (reprints &#39;&#39;Star Spangled Comics&#39;&#39; #7-32).\n* &#39;&#39;The Newsboy Legion&#39;&#39; v2, 2017, {{ISBN|978-1-4012-7236-4}} (reprints &#39;&#39;Star Spangled Comics&#39;&#39; #33-64).\n\n==Other versions==\nIn \&quot;Elseworld&#39;s Finest\&quot;, the Legion was a small sub-group of Newsboys who counted a very young Jimmy Olsen among their number. &lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Elseworld&#39;s Finest\&quot; Vol. 1 #1-2 (Oct. - Nov. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==In other media==\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Patriot Act\&quot;, the Newsboy Legion made an unnamed cameo as a group of young kids that help civilians to safety. At the end of the episode, the Newsboy Legion is part of the group that ends up saving the Justice League from [[General Wade Eiling]] by convincing him to back down.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]: [[Young Justice: Outsiders|Outsiders]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;First Impressions\&quot;, the Newsgirl Legion is a genderbent version of the group which is composed of Tommi Thompkins (voiced by [[Mae Whitman]]), Gabi Gabrielli (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]]) and Antonia \&quot;Big Words\&quot; Rodriguez (voiced by [[Zehra Fazal]]). Tommi Thompkins, is the daughter of Thomas Thompkins (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]), the mayor of [[Brooklin, Maine|Brooklyn, Maine]]. Sheriff Patrick Maguire (voiced by [[Troy Baker]]) is based on Scrapper. The characters are also an homage to &#39;&#39;[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]&#39;&#39; with Thomas and Patrick resembling Mayor Fred Jones Sr. and Sheriff Bronson Stone.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://toonopedia.com/gnewsboy.htm Newsboy Legion] at [[Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia]].
