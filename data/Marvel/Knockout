They are often depicted as antagonists to the superhero character [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain America]].\n\n==Fictional team history==\nThe Femme Fatales are villains and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] that serve as mercenaries for hire. Group members Bloodlust and Whiplash have a history of working together prior to joining the Femme Fatales, as members of a previous group called the Band of Baddies.<ref>''Marvel Comic Presents'' Vol.1 #48</ref> They were hired by fellow villain the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] in the disguise of Dr. Turner to threaten an ambassador. Spider-Man intervened and saved the ambassador, making him an enemy of the Femme Fatales. They then joined forces with other villains the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Luis Alvarez|Tarantula]], but all of them were defeated by Spider-Man and his ally the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]. Though the villains got away.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #340, 342-343.</ref>\n\nThe Femme Fatales later received an invitation to join [[Superia]] and her organization of female criminals, the [[Femizons]]. They accepted, and battled [[Captain America]] and the [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] in the process.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol.1 #389-392</ref>\n\nThe group would splinter and disband sometime later: Bloodlust and Whiplash was seen at the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Weapons Expo.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol.1 #411-413</ref>\n\nBloodlust later lost her powers after [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. Mindblast, who retained her powers, briefly allied herself with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] during the \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" storyline.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' #1</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Avengers: Standoff!]]\" storyline, Bloodlust and Mindblast were turned into duplicate [[Maria Hill]]s through the powers of [[Kobik]] in order to keep the Avengers away from Pleasant Hill.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Hunt for Wolverine]]\" storyline, the Femme Fatales are joined by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] and [[Sapphire Styx]], with Whiplash taking the name Snake Whip. The Fatales ambush [[Kitty Pryde]]'s group at the King's Impresario Restaurant at Hightown, [[Madripoor]]. While Knockout defeated [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], Bloodlust fought [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], Snake Whip fought [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], and Mindblast fought [[Psylocke]] until [[Sapphire Styx]] used her lifeforce-draining ability on Psylocke. Kitty Pryde got Jubilee and Domino away from the King's Impresario Restaurant as Snake Whip states that they won't get far.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Mindblast and Knockout prepare to have Rogue and Storm delivered to Viper's bosses in Soteira, it was revealed that Sapphire Styx was given to Viper and the Femme Fatales by Soteira as Viper tells Snake Whip to let Sapphire feed. Meanwhile, Bloodlust was seen at the Wheelers and Dealers casino with a mathematician named Stenya Ubacowits who was hired to help in the flight trajectory of a satellite.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Domino fights Bloodlust at the launch site and defeats her, Snake Whip works to restrain Sapphire when she starts to see Wolverine's Patch alias. Kitty Pryde and Jubilee fight Mindblast and Knockout until Kitty destroys the psychic-enhancements on Mindblast's back enough for Magneto to recover and join the fight. By the time, Kitty Pryde, Domino, and Jubilee catch up to Sapphire Styx, they discover that Psylocke is mentally attacking Sapphire.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Sapphire Styx exploded enabling Psylocke to create a new body from Sapphire's soul power, Kitty Pryde goes into the rocket and frees Rogue and Storm. As Rogue steals some of Knockout's strength to defeat her, Psylocke uses her powers to defeat Bloodlust and Snake Whip. Kitty Pryde and Domino persuade Magneto not to take revenge on Mindblast. After Viper gets away with Magneto pursuing her, the Femme Fatales are locked up. In a discussion between Kitty and Rogue, Snake Whip cooperated with Kitty and told her about Soteira looking for Wolverine's body in exchange for a lighter sentence.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #4.
