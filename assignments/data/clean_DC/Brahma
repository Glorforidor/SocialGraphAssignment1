The original group first appeared in a special written by Stuart Immonen published in 1999, and a later mini-series written by Fabian Nicieza, which was published in 2000. The second group debuted in Superman No. 714 in 2011.\n\n\n== Historical Supermen ==\n\nThe original Supermen of America was an official Superman fan club from the 1940s. Comic readers could send away for and receive special membership cards that also doubled as decoders. Members also received buttons and special certificates.\n\n\n== Fictional history ==\n\n\n=== Original team ===\nThe young members of the superhero team Supermen of America are all young metahumans gathered by Outburst after the shooting death of singer Junior K-D from the boy band Crossfire. Outburst and his family had been saved from death at Doomsday&#39;s hands by Superman. The young naive meta is willing to accept Lex Luthor&#39;s funding for a team of superheroes to protect the city in Superman&#39;s absence. Although Luthor volunteered money, Outburst is tasked with recruiting the members.\nOutburst first recruits his girlfriend White Lotus, a young meta trained by the Warlords of Okaara, then he gathers Brahma, Loser, Pyrogen, and Psilencer. They were salaried heroes but they were determined to protect the city from villains emboldened by news of Superman&#39;s apparent death.\nThey refurbish buildings across Metropolis and turn them into community centers. The main building Outreach 1 serves as the team&#39;s headquarters. After Psilencer&#39;s untimely death by a gang member, Outburst and his inexperienced teammates are deeply shaken and reconsider their vocation. It was around this time that the team met and recruits Maximum, the angry young protector of Suicide Slum, a chronically poor section of Metropolis. A former athlete, Maximum would have remained quadriplegic without special implants provided by Lexcorp.\nA disgruntled Lexcorp employee discovers that S.T.A.R. Labs had hidden a capsule inside a special holding chamber called Lockdown 6 in the waters near Metropolis. Luthor successfully deploys Pyrogen to retrieve the capsule from Lockdown 6, but he encounters the villainous group Deep Six and is rebuffed. Darkseid, lord of Apokolips, also wanted the contents of Lockdown 6 and had sent the Deep Six to retrieve them. In the Vega system, the Warlords of Okaara sense the danger presented by the capsule, and take preventative measures.\nThe Okaarans overpower Earth&#39;s defensive forces and White Lotus hurries to negotiate a peace settlement before they \&quot;cleanse&#39; the planet. To save Earth from worse attacks, while White Lotus was negotiating with the Okaarans, the chamber is opened and the Unimaginable was unleashed. The Unimaginable&#39;s energy form possesses Maximum and he temporarily gains immense power. Maximum&#39;s parents eventually convinced him to relinquish the power, which he disperses safely.\nIn exchange for the Supermen&#39;s silence about his involvement with the Unimaginable fiasco, Lexcorp cuts its ties with the Supermen of America charities. Lex Luthor signs all property deeds over to the organization, including Outreach 1.\n\n\n==== Current status ====\nSeveral members of the group are seen in the during the 2006 Infinite Crisis event in the pages of The OMAC Project No. 6. The team is confronting several OMACs, technologically advanced warriors controlled by a central intelligence that wishes to corral superhuman activities, even it means using murder. The OMACs analysis states the team is \&quot;67.89% neutralized\&quot;. White Lotus is shown upright and active. Brahma and Outburst are clearly down. Loser is being attacked by two OMACs. Outside of a passing reference in a subsequent issue of Superman, wherein it is mentioned Superman went to check on the team\u2014however much there was left at that point\u2014the final fate of the SoA remains unrevealed.\n\n\n=== Second team ===\nAfter a months-long walk across the US, Superman recruits several allies into a new group named after the former SoA.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n=== Original team ===\nOutburst (Mitch Anderson) \u2013 Outburst is the team leader, and has powers of magnetism manipulation..\nWhite Lotus (Nona Lin-Baker) \u2013 White Lotus has a malleable Auric forcefield and was trained in martial arts by the Warlords of Okaara. She was the offspring of African-American and Asian parents.\nBrahma (Cal Usjak) \u2013 Brahma is originally super strong and invulnerable. In the mini-series he discovered the ability to change his size as well, but the larger he grew the more petrified and stonelike his form became.\nPyrogen (Claudio Tielli) \u2013 Pyrogen is a powerful fire manipulator, and a hothead.\nLoser (Theo Storm) \u2013 Loser possesses a powerful dermal force field capable of withstanding anti-matter.\nPsilencer (Tim Thomas Townsend) \u2013 Psilencer is a prescient telepath and team tactician, killed by a gang member.\n\n\n==== Later additions ====\nMaximum (Max Williams) \u2013 Maximum is an African-American teenager created by Fabian Nicieza for the mini-series. Maximum&#39;s powers closely resembled those of Ultra Boy from the Legion of Superheroes. Max&#39;s powers come directly from Lexcorp, he can channel his special energies to increase his speed strength or senses to superhuman levels, but only one at a time.\n\n\n=== Second team ===\n\nSuperman (Kal-El/Clark Kent)\nSuperboy (Kon-El/Conner Kent)\nSupergirl (Kara Zor-El/Linda Lang)\nSteel (John Henry Irons)\nLivewire (Leslie Willis)\nArnold \&quot;Iron\&quot; Munro\nSuper-Chief (Saganowhana)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nDCU Guide entry for Supermen of America Special #1\nDCU Guide entry for Supermen of America mini-series&quot;</span>
