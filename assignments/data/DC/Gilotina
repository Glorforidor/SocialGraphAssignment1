They have been trained by [[Granny Goodness]] to serve as [[Apokolips]]&#39;s elite strike force.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infighting among the Furies is commonplace, most typically to appoint a leader to the group.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt;\n\nAfter former leader [[Big Barda]] defected to Earth to be with her lover, [[Mister Miracle]], [[Darkseid]] gave a kill order on the pair, prompting the rest of the Female Furies to strike. First, [[Mad Harriet]] and [[Stompa]] ambushed Barda but vanished after weakening her. Shortly after, Barda found and grabbed [[Lashina]] before she was able to attack, though Lashina escaped Barda&#39;s grip. A fight quickly ensued, though Lashina teleported away when Barda managed to defeat her. After tracking down a [[Mother Box]] to [[Funky Flashman]]&#39;s residence, the Furies, this time with [[Bernadeth]], appeared. Realizing that they had been tricked, the Furies destroyed the house, though Funky Flashman managed to escape by throwing his assistant at the warriors. Having failed to kill either Barda or Mister Miracle, the Furies returned to Apokolips.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mister Miracle&#39;&#39; #6 (1972). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLater, Barda had traveled back to Apokolips and recruited dozens of Female Furies to help her rescue the captured Mister Miracle. Gilotina seduced and killed the guard, allowing the other Furies to storm Section Zero. Elsewhere, Lashina took the section director&#39;s post in order to discover where Mister Miracle was held captive. The Furies ambushed Granny Goodness, who had been holding a viewing party for Mister Miracle&#39;s trial by combat with a mysterious creature called the Lump. Bernadeth held the assassin [[Kanto (comics)|Kanto]] at bay with her Fahren-knife, while an enraged Barda nearly killed Granny Goodness until she learned Mister Miracle had survived. Reunited, Barda and Mister Miracle, along with Bernadeth, Lashina, Stompa, and Mad Harriet, returned to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mister Miracle&#39;&#39; #8 (1972). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOn Earth, the Furies had little time to relax as they were soon incapacitated by the World Protective League. When they awoke, they found themselves trapped in a cage behind thick glass. They easily escaped due to Mad Harriet&#39;s claws and Stompa&#39;s boots. They also freed Mike McCracken of the All-Nations Agency. They were soon ambushed by a security patrol, though the Furies easily disposed of them. The Furies helped to defeat the Head of the World Protective League, and Mike McCracken sabotaged the building so that it would blow up in four hours. After retrieving her mega-rod, Barda teleported the group to safety.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mister Miracle&#39;&#39; #10 (1972). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhile on Earth, the Furies, without Mad Harriet, participated in Mister Miracle&#39;s tricks, using their weapons to show great feats by the escape artist. They also joined in the battle against [[Doctor Bedlam]] and his animates.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mister Miracle&#39;&#39; #11 (1972). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was next seen at the beach where they thrash some [[Navy|marines]] for interrupting their leisure swimming.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mister Miracle&#39;&#39; #12 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Lashina and Stompa later helped Barda and Ted Brown clear up a new location for Mister Miracle&#39;s act.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mister Miracle&#39;&#39; #14 (1973). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] later mentioned that Lashina and the Furies had been called to join [[New Genesis]] in the war against Apokolips.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mister Miracle&#39;&#39; #19 (1977). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nUnder unknown circumstances, the Female Furies left Barda on Earth and returned to Apokolips where they were temporarily assigned to command a unit of automated battle machines as punishment for their defection. The Furies attempted to revolt, but they were subdued along with Granny Goodness by Apokoloptian soldiers with electric jolts.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;New Gods&#39;&#39; #6 (1984). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Female Furies eventually regained Darkseid&#39;s trust, and he assigned them the task of retrieving [[Glorious Godfrey]] from Belle Reve Penitentiary. He appointed Lashina as new leader of the Furies, though [[Desaad]] tried to convince the ruler to appoint his sister Bernadeth in the position. The Furies traveled to Earth and broke into the prison, battling various members of the [[Suicide Squad]] and easily capturing their target. As the Furies opened a Boom Tube to return to Apokolips, Bernadeth betrayed Lashina, leaving her for dead on Earth. Lashina briefly took the codename Duchess and joined the Suicide Squad until she was able to find a way to return to her planet.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; #3 (1987). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLashina recruited several members of the Squad into helping her return to Apokolips, and kidnapped several others (including Big Barda).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; #33 (1989). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; When they arrived on Apokolips, the Suicide Squad battled through waves of [[Parademon]]s. They were soon after confronted by the Female Furies and other members of Darkseid&#39;s Elite.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; #34 (1989). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, Stompa battled [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] but ended up getting defeated by Barda. Mad Harriet fought and defeated [[Shade, the Changing Man]] by using his own energies against him. Newcomer Artemiz and her Cyberpak battled [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]], though the Fury suffered defeat. Bernadeth waited until Lashina had exhausted herself battling others, then struck her with her dagger. However, Lashina eventually defeated Bernadeth and killed her by snapping her neck. Granny Goodness ended the battle and welcomed Lashina back to the Furies&#39;s ranks.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; #35 (1989). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked what they should do with the remaining members of the Suicide Squad, Lashina replied: \&quot;Let&#39;s just kill them\&quot;. Before they were able to finish off the Squad, the [[Forever People]] appeared with the Suicide Squad members that had remained on Earth. Their interference allowed Big Barda and the other captives to fight back, though the battle came to an end when Darkseid appeared. Enraged that Lashina had brought humans to Apokolips, he revived Bernadeth and used his Omega Beams to disintegrate Lashina. He then revived the fallen Suicide Squad members and allowed them to leave Apokolips.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; #36 (1989). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMuch later, Granny Goodness held a combat demonstration at her orphanage, displaying Bernadeth, Stompa, Mad Harriet, and Artemiz as they battled a group of Series-9 Drones. The demonstration was interrupted by Darkseid, who revealed Mister Miracle had returned to Apokolips, and he wanted the Furies to kill him. He revived Lashina, though as punishment he kept Bernadeth as leader. The Furies managed to quickly defeat Mister Miracle and deliver him to Darkseid&#39;s throne room.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mister Miracle&#39;&#39; #17 (1990). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After his comrades aided his escape, Mister Miracle defeated the Female Furies using his miracle mister soap.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mister Miracle&#39;&#39; #18 (1990). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA second wave of Female Furies, including long-time member Gilotina, [[Malice Vundabar]], [[Bloody Mary (DC Comics)|Bloody Mary]], and [[Speed Queen (comics)|Speed Queen]], later appeared and went on a killing spree, but were stopped by [[Hawk and Dove]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Hawk and Dove&#39;&#39; #21 (1991). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Furies made an appearance as antagonists in [[Grant Morrison]]&#39;s acclaimed &#39;&#39;[[Seven Soldiers]]&#39;&#39; event, specifically in the &#39;&#39;Seven Soldiers: [[Mister Miracle]]&#39;&#39; mini-series. Here, they are all given human forms along with Darkseid and his other minions, with the Furies all becoming prostitutes with Granny Goodness acting as their pimp. They attempt to entice [[Shilo Norman]], the second Mr. Miracle when he arrives at the [[Dark Side Club]] searching for Darkseid himself. They knock Shilo out, and then stuff him in the trunk of a car while he is bound and gagged, eventually torturing and setting him ablaze in a forest. This is later revealed to be a horrid illusion brought about by Darkseid&#39;s [[Omega Sanction]].\n\nThey are later shown aiding Granny in her scheme to overthrow the [[Greek Gods]], kidnapping Dr. Helena Sandsmark in order to antagonize her daughter [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]] during the events of her solo mini-series. After the deaths of [[Mister Miracle]] and [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] during the [[Death of the New Gods]], the Source stated Darkseid was the only remaining New God. The only Furies who were not visibly killed, currently, are Lashina, Stompa, Gilotina, Malice, Wunda, and Artemiz; although at the end of &#39;&#39;Death of the New Gods&#39;&#39; it is reiterated that all the New Gods are dead. While the New Gods were being killed off, Granny Goodness orchestrated the [[Amazons Attack|Amazon-American war]] to pose as [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] to train women (such as [[Harley Quinn]] and [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]]) under the auspices of becoming Amazon warriors into new Female Furies. This seems to conflict directly with &#39;&#39;[[Terror Titans]]&#39;&#39;, where Lashina (in her human form), is shown to be one of the villains running the Dark Side Club with the Clock King. She is last seen being electrocuted into unconsciousness by [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], who then presumably turns her over to the authorities with the rest of the upper level Dark Side Club players.\n\nAfter the end of the Fourth World, in the [[Final Crisis|Final Crisis of mankind]], the corrupted [[Mary Marvel]] released the [[Anti-Life Equation]] and creates new Female Furies from Earth&#39;s heroines and villainesses, including [[Wonder Woman]], [[Catwoman]], [[Giganta]] and [[Batwoman]].\n\n===&#39;&#39;The New 52&#39;&#39;===\nIn 2011, &#39;&#39;[[The New 52]]&#39;&#39; rebooted the continuity of the DC universe and introduced a brand new Fury named Sweet Leilani. Granny Goodness sent Leilani to Earth in order to retrieve a Mother Box. She discovered that it was in the new [[OMAC (comics)#Kevin Kho|O.M.A.C.]]&#39;s possession. After a battle, Leilani was defeated and quickly retreated, vowing to return with the other Female Furies.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;OMAC&#39;&#39; #6 (2012). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Under unknown circumstances, Sweet Leilani left Darkseid&#39;s employ along with teammates Enchanthrax, Killsandra, and Thumpa, and formed the Femmes Fatales. Together, they joined the Cult of Yuga Khan. The cult&#39;s leader, Aagog, sent the Femmes Fatales to Earth in order to capture Beautiful Dreamer of the [[Forever People]] in hopes to resurrect Yuga Khan. After suffering defeat by the Forever People, the unconscious Femmes Fatales were gathered by Lashina and Granny Goodness, the latter of whom mentioned that a war was approaching and that \&quot;all they need is the kind of love only Granny can give\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Man and the Forever People&#39;&#39; #7-8 (2015). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the Darkseid War, Lashina and [[Kanto (comics)|Kanto]] went to Earth in search of the amazon Myrina Black, who had given birth to Darkseid&#39;s child, Grail.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; #41 (2015). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After Darkseid&#39;s death, Lashina, Kanto, and [[Kalibak]] encountered Wonder Woman, Mr. Miracle, and several other heroes.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; #45 (2015). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Gods were close to defeating the heroes until Big Barda appeared, which drove the villains back. Barda proposed a peace treaty with Lashina, but Lashina refused, declaring that the Furies would never stop hunting her down.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; #46 (2016). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLater, Barda returned to Apokolips and made a pact with the Furies: Barda would return to the group if they helped her defeat Grail and protect Mr. Miracle. While Grail and the newly revived, enslaved Darkseid were about to defeat Wonder Woman, Mr. Miracle, and the other heroes, Barda appeared through a boom tube alongside Lashina, Stompa, Bernadeth, Mad Harriet, [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]], Kalibak, and Kanto. Working together with the heroes, the Furies were able to defeat Grail and separate Darkseid from the Anti-Life Equation. In the ensuing explosion, Darkseid and Grail both vanish. Big Barda revealed the truth to Mr. Miracle and left with the other Furies back to Apokolips.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; #50 (2016). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;DC Rebirth&#39;&#39;===\nAfter the events of the \&quot;Darkseid War\&quot; storyline that led to \&quot;[[DC Rebirth]]\&quot;, [[Lex Luthor]] became ruler of Apokolips. Granny Goodness, along with the Furies, remained loyal to Darkseid, and awaited his return on the outskirts of Apokolips. A Mother Box later mysteriously teleported [[Lois Lane]] to Apokolips. Granny Goodness, along with Lashina, Stompa, and Mad Harriet, as well as several other unnamed Furies, took Lois captive. However, after being ambushed by a Dredge Worm, Lois managed to win over the Furies by aiding them in battle. Granny invited Lois to join the Furies and replace a fallen Fury. When a different Fury opposed Lois joining, Granny reminded her of Alianna Hubbard, the first human to join their ranks. Later, Granny offered Lois Lane some cooked meat and reminded her that the Furies are family.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Superman #34 2018\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #34 (2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nGranny Goodness and the Furies, with Lois, then made their way for the main citadel of Apokolips. Along the way, they discovered Kalibak, who had captured Superman and Lex Luthor. When Granny Goodness scolded Kalibak, he attacked, and a battle between the Furies and Kalibak&#39;s forces ensued. During the battle, Lois Lane rescued Superman, who attacked Kalibak. Before he could be defeated, Kalibak used his machine to absorb the fires from Apokolips. This severely weakened Superman, though the battle escalated when Superman&#39;s son rode in on the Hunger Dogs of Apokolips.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #35 (2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs the battle raged on, Lashina and Mad Harriet attacked Superman while Granny fought Kalibak. When Lois Lane jumped to Superman&#39;s defense, the Furies turned on her, claiming that by caring for a man she was belittling the progress that the Furies had made. However, Lois managed to defeat the Furies with her spear. Later, Lashina, Stompa, and Mad Harriet were seen dressed in rags in a prison cell after Superman took leadership of Apokolips.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #36 (2018).
