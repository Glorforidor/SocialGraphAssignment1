Billy Yank

Billy Yank or Billy Yankee is the personification of the loyal United States soldier (volunteer or Regular) during the American Civil War. The latter part of the name is derived from yankee, a slang term for New Englanders. Although little evidence exists to suggest that the name was used widely during the Civil War (unlike its rebel counterpart Johnny Reb), early 20th century political cartoonists introduced 'Billy Yank' to symbolize U.S. combatants in the American Civil War of the 1860s.
Billy Yank is usually pictured wearing a regulation Federal blue wool uniform that included the fatigue blouse, a light-weight wool coat with an inside pocket and four brass buttons on the front, with a kepi-style forage cap made of wool broadcloth with a rounded, flat top, cotton lining, and leather visor.
