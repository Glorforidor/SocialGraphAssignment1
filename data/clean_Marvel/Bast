The Heliopolitans first full Golden Age appearance was in the story \&quot;The Terror That Creeps\&quot; by Stan Lee and Werner Roth, published in Marvel Tales #96 (June 1950), and involves a man that fails to convince the public that the Great Sphinx of Giza is slowly moving to the edge of the desert, where it will be empowered by Set and destroy mankind. The goddess Bast would later make her first appearance (as a totem) with the Black Panther in Fantastic Four #52 (July 1966). Many of the other deities, including Horus, Isis and Osiris, were introduced in Thor #239 (September 1975). Khonshu, who became associated with Moon Knight, first appeared in Moon Knight #1 (November 1980). Joseph Muszynski argued in his book Everything I Needed to Know About Life I Learned from Marvel Comics that the introduction of Egyptian deities \&quot;excited our tendency to enjoy variety\&quot; as the pantheon contained multiple gods and personalities as opposed to the Judeo-Christian religions. Ed Strauss contended that Marvel was able to dive into ancient Egyptian religion because it \&quot;had long been retired into the realm of mythology\&quot; unlike Christianity.\n\n\n== Fictional history ==\nThe Heliopolitans were worshipped as deities by the inhabitants of the Nile River Valley from as early as 10,000 BC. According to Heliopolitan legend, the first of these were Gaea (as Neith), the Demiurge (as Nun), and Set (as Apep/Apophis). Neith and Nun sired Atum, the first of the Ogdoad \u2014 the old gods. As Neith went about creating mortal life, Set desired to destroy her creations. In turn, Neith called Atum for protection. Atum and Set fought for eons until Atum transformed into the Demogorge and drove Set off. After Set&#39;s defeat, Atum begot the Ennaed \u2014 the new gods, took the name Ra and settled in the sun.The Ennead resided in the ancient city of Heliopolis until their king Osiris placed mortal pharaohs in charge so that the gods could become less involved with human affairs and relocated themselves to the extradimensional realm of Celestial Heliopolis. A few, including Bast, Sobek, and Sekhmet, choose to remain on Earth. Bast would eventually become the patron deity of Wakanda, while Sobek and Sekhmet became patrons of less influential African cults. The pantheon of Wakanda was later retconned as the Orisha, consisting of Thoth, Ptah, Mujaji, Kokou and Bast.In Celestial Heliopolis, Seth murdered his brother Osiris in an attempted coup but Osiris&#39; wife Isis, and his sons Horus and Anubis combined their powers to resurrect Osiris. Osiris then dispatched Horus to exact revenge on Seth in a battle that lasted for several hundred years, ending when Seth gained the upper hand and sealed the gods in a pyramid. The trapped gods remained in the pyramid for several millennia until they managed to reach out to the Asgardian god Odin. With help from Odin&#39;s son, Thor, they defeated Seth, severing his left hand as they battled, and freed the Heliopolitans.Osiris later empowered Thor to revive Asgardians who were harmed by the Destroyer.The gods of Heliopolis, powerless and calling themselves \&quot;Lost Ones\&quot;, joined Thor and Earth Force in fighting Seth and his forces again, and ultimately regained their powers after the apparent death of Seth.\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe gods Bast and Sekhmet were both mentioned by T&#39;Challa / Black Panther in the 2016 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Captain America: Civil War, with T&#39;Challa explaining, \&quot;In my culture, death is not the end. It&#39;s more of a stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands, and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veld where you can run forever.\&quot; Bast is again mentioned in the prologue of the 2018 film Black Panther as having helped the first Black Panther become king of Wakanda.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nHorus appears in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2, voiced by Colin McFarlane. He is found in the Egypt area of Chronopolis and helps Captain America, Doctor Strange, and Thor fight an awakened N&#39;Kantu, the Living Mummy while Captain Marvel works to free Hulk from the quicksand. After Loki is defeated, Horus sees to it that Loki puts right what he has wronged in Egypt.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of deities in Marvel Comics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHeliopolitans at The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe\nHeliopolis at MarvelDirectory.com\nHeliopolitans on Marvel Database, a Marvel Comics wiki&quot;</span>
