                <span class="s2">&quot;extract&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Morlocks are a group of mutant characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The characters are usually depicted as being associated with the X-Men in the Marvel Universe. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Paul Smith, they were named after the subterranean race of the same name in H. G. Wells&#39; novel The Time Machine - but unlike in the Wells book, they are not a faceless, threatening mass of villains. They first appeared as a group in The Uncanny X-Men #169 (May 1983). Caliban appeared prior to that, but he was not yet a member of the Morlocks.\nThe Morlocks were depicted as an underground society (both literally and figuratively) of outcast mutants living as tunnel dwellers in the sewers, abandoned tunnels, and abandoned subway lines beneath New York City. The Morlocks were composed of mutant misfits, especially those mutants who, because of physical mutations or other conspicuous manifestations of their mutant genetics, were unable to pass as human in normal society. Subjected to hate, fear, and disgust from human society due to their \&quot;deformed\&quot; appearances, dangerous mutations, or otherwise outcast or misfit statuses, most of the Morlocks viewed humans (and even more mainstream mutants such as the X-Men) with distrust and anger, and they occasionally committed criminal or antisocial acts upon the above-ground human society.\nDue to a series of tragedies, the original Morlocks no longer reside in subterranean New York City (except Marrow, who was one of the original Morlocks as a child), although a violent splinter cell Gene Nation and a comparable group called Those Who Live in Darkness have emerged. Similar groups, called Morlocks by readers and/or the X-Men themselves, have appeared under Chicago and London.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to Callisto, she formed the Morlocks by first recruiting Caliban, and then using his power to track down other mutants who were unable to integrate into normal society. The Morlocks initially squatted in a network of abandoned, interconnected tunnels beneath Manhattan, which had originally been built as Cold War bomb shelters and then forgotten.The X-Men were alerted to the existence of the Morlocks when their leader Callisto kidnapped Angel and intended to make him her mate. This brought Storm to challenge Callisto to a duel for leadership of the Morlocks. Victorious, Storm orders an end to their attacks on normal humans, but she does not assume leadership of the Morlocks full-time. Against her wishes, several Morlocks later kidnap the child superheroes Power Pack so that they could be raised by the Morlock Annalee, who had lost her own children. When Callisto discovers what was going on, she forces Annalee to let them go. They promise to return in the future to keep her company.A majority of the Morlocks are slaughtered by Mister Sinister&#39;s Marauders in the \&quot;Mutant Massacre\&quot;. Most of the survivors move on to join Gene Nation, having lived in a pocket dimension led by Mikhail Rasputin. Leech instead becomes a ward of Generation X. Other survivors include Erg and Beautiful Dreamer (whose whereabouts were unknown until \&quot;Decimation\&quot;), Thornn, (who would join X-Corporation), and Caliban.\nIt is later revealed that many of the Morlocks were actually failed experiments of the Dark Beast, although he made certain that they didn&#39;t remember being tampered with, however Mister Sinister recognized that the Morlocks were based on his own genetic studies (which the Dark Beast learned from the Sinister of his reality), and that&#39;s why he ordered the Marauders to kill the entire underground society.\nA new group called the Tunnel Rats which also calls itself \&quot;Those Who Live in Darkness\&quot; have inhabited the sewer tunnels just below the surface of Mutant Town/District X. District X writer David Hine claims to never have intended this group to have any ties to the original Morlocks.During the \&quot;Decimation\&quot; storyline, some of the remaining powered Morlocks sought out asylum at the X-Mansion. There were some Morlocks that remained underground under Marrow&#39;s protection.During the \&quot;Endangered Species\&quot; storyline, Masque and the Morlocks with him began their search for Magneto where they had some future-telling diaries with them where one of them states that Magneto is still a mutant in light of M-Day.At the time when the Terrigen Cloud was loose on Earth infecting mutants with M-Pox since the \&quot;Infinity\&quot; storyline, the number of mutants that are living underground had increased. In addition to these mutants, Callisto showed sympathy towards the humans who sought out refuge from the global landscape. As a way to live out the dream of Professor X, this unified society of humans and mutants lived together as the New Morlocks. The Morlock are further decimated by the Mauraders, but Cyclops helps the Chechnyan government expel rebels in exchange for a Morlock sanctuary.When Krakoa was established as a mutant paradise, known Morlocks Caliban and a revived Healer are among its citizens.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n=== Founding Members ===\nDebuting along with the rest of the Morlocks (with the exception of Caliban) it was revealed that Masque, Caliban, Callisto and Sunder founded the Morlocks under the streets of Manhattan.\n\nCaliban - Caliban became Death, and later Pestilence.

The event resulted in the Marauders killing many of the Morlocks under orders of Mr. Sinister. Only a few survived, with the protection of the X-Men, X-Factor, Power Pack and Thor. The event spanned Uncanny X-Men #210-212, X-Factor #9-11, New Mutants #46, Thor #373-374 and Power Pack #27.

Few, however, returned to the Alley, their original home. There, Masque assumed leadership. Many new surviving Morlocks were introduced when Sabretooth decided to finish his original task. He is stopped by a newly \&quot;upgraded\&quot; Caliban. Later, a splinter group of the Morlocks is introduced.

As leader, he then floods the tunnels in order to destroy the remaining Morlocks. It is revealed later that he actually transported the Morlocks to another dimension dubbed the Hill, whose timeline moved faster than the main Marvel Universe. There, he set himself up as their king and forced them to fight for the right to live.\n\nBrain Cell - Current whereabouts and status unknown.\nMarilou - Killed by Mikhail Rasputin.\nMarrow - One of the Morlocks that were transported to the Hill dimension by Mikhail Rasputin.

When attacked by Humanity&#39;s Last Stand, an emotional backlash caused D&#39;Gard to assume control over Storm, who relinquished her leadership role. In X-Men: Prime many of the Hill Morlocks returned to found Gene Nation. As the new group, they attacked the human oppressors of the past Morlocks under the leadership of Marrow. It is unknown whether the remaining Morlocks of Africa stayed there or relocated to New York. A few have been seen there since, as well as a few Morlocks who chose to remain in New York City despite previous attempts on their lives.\n\nBoost - One of the surviving Morlocks.

However, Feral and Thornn were later seen re-powered; but this was later to be revealed in Wolverine (vol. 3) #54-55 that only their physical mutations were restored, not their mutant powers, which led to Feral being killed by Sabretooth.\nIn one of Generation M&#39;s \&quot;Ex-Mutants&#39; Diaries,\&quot; Sally interviews Marrow about the Morlocks. Marrow reports that 80% of the remaining Morlocks (which was most likely already very small) are depowered now and look like humans. She states that most of them are still afraid about going out of the tunnels.\nCurrently, Marrow works as a watchman of the Morlocks, as she is called by the remaining ones when problems occur. She explained this status in the aftermath of thirteen depowered Morlocks murdered by Ghoul.\nOne character commented that, post-M-Day, the chance of meeting a Morlock in the tunnels under New York is now harder than meeting an alligator in the Floridian sewers.\nSome former Morlocks who actually kept their powers sought refuge at Xavier&#39;s Institute and became known as the 198. They are Beautiful Dreamer, Caliban, Erg, Leech, and Skids.\nDark Beast and Mikhail Rasputin are also still powered, though Mikhail is in Kapalan.\n\n\n=== The Extremists ===\nDuring Ed Brubaker&#39;s \&quot;The Extremists\&quot; arc, the Morlocks reappear under the leadership of Masque and now consisting of Bliss, Erg, Litterbug, Skids and a recently captured Leech. Later in this story, it was revealed Skids only joined the Morlocks to spy on them on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\n\n=== All current Morlocks shown after M-Day ===\nPowered\n\nBeautiful Dreamer - Killed by the Purifiers using a new form of the Legacy Virus\nBliss - A resident of Utopia\nJoe Bugs - An insect-like mutant who was shown only in flashback.

In it, a small group of mutants living in the sewers of Chicago help each other to fulfill their one last wish on the surface while trying to escape the mutant-hunting Sentinels.\n\nAngel Dust - She ran away from home upon discovering she was a mutant, to protect her family from possible Sentinel attacks. Adrenaline gives her bursts of super-strength. Confirmed to be depowered by S.H.I.E.L.D..\nCell - Robber and gang member whose body transformed into a giant, single-celled body capable of extending pseudopods and engulfing objects which then are digested.

They were being pursued by an agent of the Church of Humanity named Mr. Clean, a genetically engineered human who was stalking and killing mutants. This was their only appearance. It is unknown whether or not they survived the persecution of the Church of Humanity.\n\nBurning Puddle - Son of Miss Saccharine. Sweats acid.

One known Morlock member was Artemis.After the fall of Apocalypse, a trail of escaped mutants from the Breeding Pens lead the X-Men underground, they encountered a group of scared, orphaned children called the Morlocks. The X-Men offered to help bring them out of hiding in the sewers, but the Morlocks lashed out at them for fear of being locked up and thrown back into cages by the X-Men, now mutant-hunting officers of the newly restored human government. The X-Men emerged victorious and the Morlocks were brought back to the Xavier Institute where they were detained.\n\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nThe Morlocks in the Ultimate Marvel universe have a more sophisticated underground living situation than the mainstream Morlocks, including at least one mutant with energy-generating powers to provide electricity, hydroponic gardens to provide or supplement their food supply, and external air-exchange vents.\nIn Ultimate X-Men #80 Nightcrawler saves the Morlock named Pyro, who was outnumbered while fighting the Friends of Humanity and the police. Other members shown as of issue #82 are Caliban, Callisto, Sparks and Sunder (who was the leader). After a fight with the X-Men (who were trying to rescue Toad), the Morlocks elected Nightcrawler as their new leader. In #90 Mister Sinister finishes his 10 mutant kills at the Morlock base.

Instead, they are referred to as The Omegas. Callisto is still the leader (she possessed Caliban&#39;s mutant sensory ability and Quicksilver&#39;s speed), but other members (including Anole, Arclight, Glob Herman, Phat, Psylocke, Quill/Kid Omega, and Spike) are pulled from other parts of The X-Men universe. Leech also appears in the film, with no apparent connection to The Omegas.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe Northern California thrash metal band Hatchet have a song called \&quot;Morlock&#39;s Tomb\&quot; based on the characters from X-Men.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe Morlocks appear in X-Men: The Animated Series. Its members are Annalee, Ape, Caliban, Callisto, Erg, Glowworm, Leech, Masque, Mole, Plague, Scaleface, Sunder, Tar Baby, and Tommy. They first appear in \&quot;Captive Hearts\&quot; where the Morlocks captured Cyclops and Jean Grey. The X-Men led by Storm then came to get Jean and Cyclops back. In the end after a duel between Storm and Callisto, not only did the X-Men get Cyclops and Jean back, Storm also gained leadership of the Morlocks. Several of the Morlocks would have subsequent cameos outside of the sewers (an example being \&quot;Sanctuary\&quot;). They would have a major role to play in the episode \&quot;Out of the Past\&quot; and were last seen in \&quot;Have Yourself a Morlock Little X-Mas\&quot;.\nThe Morlocks have appeared in the X-Men: Evolution episode \&quot;X-Treme Measures.\&quot; The members of the Morlocks represented include Caliban, Callisto, Cybelle, and Scaleface. The series also introduced the Morlock characters Facade (a mutant boy with camouflage powers who can blend with his surroundings), Lucid (a mutant with X-Ray vision who is voiced by Lee Tockar), and Torpid (a mute mutant little girl with a paralyzing touch coming from her large hands). Unlike their comic counterparts, they have no facial reconstructions as bestowed by Masque (who is not featured in this series), although some are naturally ugly due to their mutations. The Morlocks first appear attacking a beverage factory because something in the drinks is poisonous to mutants. It leaked into the tunnels, causing some of the unnamed members to fall ill. Spyke later joined them to protect the weaker Morlocks. In the episode \&quot;Uprising,\&quot; Spyke protects the Morlocks and convinces them not to stay hidden. The Morlocks later help Spyke and the X-Men fight Duncan Matthews and his friends when they start attacking mutants.\nThe Morlocks have appeared in The Gifted season two episode \&quot;coMplications\&quot;, led by their leader Erg.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nIn the video game X-Men Legends, the X-Men must go on a mission to rescue Gambit from the Morlocks.

Aside from Marrow and Healer are a substantial number of unnamed Morlock Grunts, Morlock Claws, Morlock Goths, Morlock Lieutenants, Morlock Giants, Morlock Leviathans, and Morlock Blades.\nIn X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse, the Morlocks have been brainwashed by Apocalypse and Mister Sinister, leading Marrow as a known survivor where she has joined Moira MacTaggert and others in helping rescue refugees.\nThe Morlock Tunnels appear in the video game Marvel Heroes.
