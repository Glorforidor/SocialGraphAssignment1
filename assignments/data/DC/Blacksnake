The character was created by editor and co-plotter [[Julius Schwartz]], writer [[Gardner Fox]] and [[penciler]] [[Gil Kane]]. The Atom was one of the first superheroes of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] and debuted in &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; #34 (October 1961).\n\nThe Atom has been played in various TV series by Alfie Wise and [[John Kassir]]. He was currently played by [[Brandon Routh]] in &#39;&#39;[[Legends of Tomorrow]]&#39;&#39; in the shared DC [[Arrowverse]] on [[The CW]]. His character first appeared in the third season of &#39;&#39;[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]].&#39;&#39;\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Atom debuted in &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; #34 ([[cover-date]]d Oct. 1961) from the [[DC Comics]] precursor, National Comics.&lt;ref name=gcdshowcase34&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/16431/ &#39;&#39;Showcase&#39;&#39; #34] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420155431/http://www.comics.org/issue/16431/ |date=April 20, 2016 }} at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; Early comics-fandom pioneer [[Jerry Bails]] wrote to the National Comics editor [[Julius Schwartz]] in December 1960 outlining an updated version of [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Al Pratt]], the company&#39;s 1940s [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Atom.&lt;ref name=alterego2p8&gt;{{cite news | authorlink= Roy Thomas | first= Roy | last = Thomas | title = Splitting the Atom | work = [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] | date = Autumn 1999 | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bails and future [[Marvel Comics]] editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]] collaborated on a suggested version that incorporated elements of a Golden Age hero, [[Quality Comics]]&#39; [[Doll Man]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;alterego2p8-9\&quot;&gt;Thomas, \&quot;Splitting the Atom\&quot;, pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Eventual Atom writer [[Gardner Fox]] wrote Bails on January 1, 1961, stating that Schwartz passed along Bails&#39; letter to him.\n{{quote|...so that I might write and let you know that okay okay okay (this is hush-hush) an Atom book may get under way [sic] in the next month or so. I am trying to cook up some \&quot;new\&quot; super-powers for him in.... Your own suggestions are excellent and most especially the one about the atomic compression of his body, which is to be a feature of the \&quot;new\&quot; Atom. I have seen art samples of how he will look. ... [A]t the present moment the intent is to make him a college student rather than the scientific experimenter you have in mind. This is all talk, mind you &amp;mdash; nothing definite.&lt;ref&gt;Fox letter to Bails, reprinted in Thomas, \&quot;Splitting the Atom\&quot;, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\nSchwartz wrote Bails on January 6 saying he had already been planning a new version of the Atom, in the vein of National&#39;s reimagined Golden Age superheroes the Flash and Green Lantern, and had already asked artist [[Gil Kane]] to sketch designs.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz letter to Bails, reprinted in Thomas, \&quot;Splitting the Atom\&quot;, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Kane, unaware of Bails&#39; suggestions,&lt;ref name=alterego2p11&gt;Thomas, \&quot;Splitting the Atom\&quot;, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; said he did \&quot;a series of drawings\&quot; on large illustration boards, including a depiction of the new Atom riding a [[German shepherd]] dog and another of a pistol firing at the Atom, who wore the costume he eventually would in his comic debut but without a belt.&lt;ref name=alterego2p10&gt;Thomas, \&quot;Splitting the Atom\&quot;, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Kane, who lived in [[Jericho, New York]], on [[Long Island]], at the time, drove to the nearby [[Hicksville, New York|Hicksville]] home of DC production person Tom Nicolosi, who colored the drawings using St. Martin&#39;s dyes.&lt;ref name=alterego2p10 /&gt; Schwartz, after seeing the drawings, had the belt added, a detail Kane said he disliked since \&quot;it broke up the costume lines.\&quot;&lt;ref name=alterego2p11Kane&gt;Kane in Thomas, \&quot;Splitting the Atom\&quot;, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz said he had not wanted to reuse the Golden Age Atom, Al Pratt, and had read about [[dwarf star]]s and thought a fragment of one could power the new hero&#39;s miniaturization. He added that he and Fox together plotted the early stories of this new Silver Age Atom.&lt;ref name=alterego2p13&gt;Thomas, \&quot;Splitting the Atom\&quot;, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Fox said in 1979, \&quot;I doubt that any feedback from Bails or Thomas had very much of an influence, though always kept their ideas in the back of our minds.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;March 26, 1979, letter from Fox to James Flanagan, published in &#39;&#39;Robin Snyder&#39;s History of Comics&#39;&#39; vol. 2, #2 (Feb. 1991) and quoted in Thomas, \&quot;Splitting the Atom\&quot;, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHis [[alter ego]], Ray Palmer, is an homage to [[science-fiction]] magazine editor [[Raymond A. Palmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason |last=Brice |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/bobro/102552572329705.htm |title=Alter Egos And Alternate Earths |publisher=ComicsBulletin.com |date=1998-08-14 |accessdate=2011-03-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810205911/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/bobro/102552572329705.htm |archivedate=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Silver Age===\nRaymond \&quot;Ray\&quot; Palmer, is a physicist and professor at Ivy University in the fictional city of [[Ivy Town]], somewhere in [[New England]], specializing in matter compression as a means to fight overpopulation, famine and other world problems. Using a mass of [[white dwarf star]] matter he finds after it lands on Earth, Palmer fashions a [[lens (optics)|lens]] that enables him to shrink any object to any degree he wishes. Compression destabilizes an object&#39;s molecular structure, however, causing it to explode.\n[[File:Ray Palmer and Jean Loring (circa 1961).png|left|thumb|Ray Palmer with his girlfriend and later wife, [[Jean Loring]]. Art by [[Gil Kane]] and [[Murphy Anderson]] from &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; #34 (Oct. 1961).]]\nDuring a [[spelunking]] expedition, Palmer and his students, along with his girlfriend, lawyer [[Jean Loring]], find themselves trapped in a cave. In desperation, Palmer secretly uses the lens he has carried with him to shrink himself in order to be able to climb through a small opening in the fallen rocks sealing the cave, knowing he will likely explode. Using a [[diamond]] [[engagement ring]], Palmer enlarges the hole sufficiently and descends to the floor to try to alert the others of the escape route before dying. However, upon entering the lens&#39; beam, he finds himself returned to normal size and without danger of exploding. As the lens is covered with cave moisture, Palmer believes this has altered the beam to allow this strange effect. When subsequent experiments still result in objects exploding, Palmer concludes some unknown force in his own body allows him to safely size-shift. He decides to use this effect to become a superhero.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Beatty, Scott|first = Wallace, Dan|author-link =|contribution = Atom II|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 30|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = London|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[retcon]] in &#39;&#39;Brightest Day: The Atom Special&#39;&#39; (July 2010) removes the influence of his exotic physical makeup, tying his survival instead to the discovery of a &#39;&#39;compression matrix,&#39;&#39; a fabric able to spread the effects of the ray on the entire body, stabilizing it. The prototype matrix later became his costume.&lt;ref name=\&quot;bdtas\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Brightest Day: The Atom Special&#39;&#39; (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nPalmer creates a belt tool to control his miniaturization to [[subatomic]] size with an emergency backup mechanism in his gloves, and develops a costume that he can wear at most times that only becomes visible when he shrinks significantly. In addition, he develops equipment that allows him to decrease his weight in addition to his size, allowing him to glide on air currents on a low setting, while a high setting allows him to handle or strike objects with the equivalent strength of his normal size and build. A favorite travel method is to call some location on the [[telephone]] and when the phone is answered, Palmer can shrink enough to travel through the phone lines in seconds to emerge out the answering phone.\n\nHe carries out the bulk of his early superheroic adventures in Ivy Town, where he often helps his girlfriend, Jean Loring, win her cases. Much later, he gains the innate equivalent powers within his own body.\n\nPalmer has fought against several alien and supernatural threats, as well as having his own rogues gallery: his arch enemy is [[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]] the Time Bandit, the menace of the [[Bug-Eyed Bandit]], the dangerous eco-terrorist [[Floronic Man]], and the miniature misguided [[List of hidden races in DC Comics#E|Bat-Knights of Elvaran]]. He also had several [[time travel]] adventures by means of Professor Alpheus V. Hyatt&#39;s Time Pool. The Atom is a member of several incarnations of the [[Justice League]], and the team is gracious enough to supply a special chair scaled to his default size which can elevate to whatever height needed so he can easily partake in team meetings without having to go out of costume. There, he meets [[Hawkman]] ([[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] pre-&#39;&#39;[[Hawkworld]]&#39;&#39;, [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]] post-&#39;&#39;Hawkworld&#39;&#39;), one of his closest friends in the superhero community. Neither character achieved major popularity, and even in their heyday were mostly supporting characters, often with Palmer as a specialist in size alteration who was often needed to access extremely confined areas only he could access. Hawkman would manufacture [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] wings for a [[myna]] Ray saved, taking on the name Major Mynah and became the Atom&#39;s partner and steed.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Sword of the Atom, Power of the Atom, and Teen Titans&#39;&#39;===\n[[File:SwordAtom3.jpg|thumb|left|&#39;&#39;Sword of the Atom&#39;&#39; #3. Cover art by [[Gil Kane]].]]\nThe Atom had one short-lived [[miniseries]] and three subsequent specials, all titled &#39;&#39;Sword of the Atom&#39;&#39;, in which Palmer abandons civilization after divorcing his wife Jean, who had an affair with fellow lawyer Paul Hoben, and becomes the hero of a tribe of six-inch (152&amp;nbsp;mm) -tall yellow-skinned humanoid aliens called [[List of hidden races in DC Comics#M|Morlaidhans]] in the jungles of [[South America]]. He also becomes consort to their princess, Laethwyn. Palmer bequeathes his size-changing belt and role as Ivy Town&#39;s protector to Jean&#39;s new husband, Hoben. During this time, Palmer&#39;s friend Norman Brawler pens the book &#39;&#39;The Atom&#39;s Farewell&#39;&#39;, in which he reveals Palmer&#39;s identity as the Atom.\n\nEventually the colony is destroyed, despite Palmer&#39;s attempt to save it, by a group associated with the US Government acting as [[loggers]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power of the Atom&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer is forced to escape via the telephone to [[North America]]. In the attempt, he fails to anticipate that the connection will involve [[artificial satellite|satellite]] relay and the unexpectedly arduous trip causes him to remain at approximately three feet high and without his costume&#39;s size changing equipment.\n\nWith the help of a friend, Ray creates a new costume from the material of the white dwarf star. This time, instead of a belt, Palmer uses an encephalotronic grid in the costume&#39;s headpiece to control the costume. The grid is keyed to his unique brainwaves. This enables him to transfer his mass into an unknown dimension which allows him to alter his size and weight just by thinking about it. He can even make the new costume appear or disappear with a thought by shifting most of its atoms to or from the other dimension. This allows him to be in costume while at full height or to shrink without having to have his costume appear. He can even increase his weight while remaining six inches (152&amp;nbsp;mm) tall or reduce his weight while remaining at full size. Ray often does this and is then light enough to ride wind currents, where he actually appears to be flying to a limited degree. Palmer also develops a mental link with the white dwarf matter to which he has been regularly exposed. Most of the mass lies within another dimension. Ray can draw upon that mass and hit with a super-concussive force. He has been shown to punch through concrete walls, crush an exam table and break the axle of a car that is moving at high speed.\n\n[[File:Power of the Atom 07.jpg|thumb|&#39;&#39;Power of the Atom&#39;&#39; #7, depicting the Atom in his new costume]]\nPalmer would learn of those behind the genocide of the Morlaidhans, namely five [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operatives, part of a group called the Cabal. In a mission called Operation: Fireball, the tiny aliens were murdered in hopes Ray would return as the Atom and become a tool for the Cabal (as Ray worked for the CIA in his earlier years). Instead, Palmer shrank the five agents to six-inch height and the CIA would employ them as a group called Micro/Squad. The Atom would take on new enemies during this period, such as Humbug, a sentient robot in control of an army of duplicates of itself, and Strobe, a technological armor-clad crook. Micro/Squad would also return, attempting to murder Palmer for what he did to them. Instead, teammate Ginsburg dies in the explosion they set and Ray approaches [[Atom (comics)#Adam Cray|Adam Cray]] about becoming the new Atom in order to bring the remaining Micro/Squad into the open. Cray agrees, steals Paul Hoben&#39;s size-changing belt, and joins the [[Suicide Squad]]. The plan works as the villains emerge and Palmer takes the place of operative Sting; but their leader, Blacksnake, kills Cray and takes the belt for himself, returning to normal height. Blacksnake murders the remaining members of his crew as Ray arrives, revealing himself, posing as Sting, and battles him. After Blacksnake is defeated, the Cabal employs Task Force X II to murder him in order to protect their secrets.\n\nLater, during the events of &#39;&#39;[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]&#39;&#39;, Palmer is rejuvenated to a teenage state and develops the ability to grow in height in addition to his previous abilities, all of which he was capable of controlling innately without using his white dwarf star-based equipment. He becomes field leader of a new group of [[Teen Titans#Teen Titans (vol. 2, 1996\u20131998)|Teen Titans]], composed of hybrids of human beings and the [[H&#39;San Natall]], after a chance meeting with [[Isaiah Crockett (comics)|Isaiah Crockett]] on his first day attending Ivy University. As a former member of the Justice League, Palmer viewed his affiliation with the Teen Titans as a step backward. The group primarily battled the [[List of criminal organizations in DC Comics#V|Veil]], an anti-alien organization that employed [[Deathstroke]] and [[Dark Nemesis]], but it&#39;s revealed that their leader Pylon was actually a H&#39;San Natall. They would also face Jugular (hired by the H&#39;San Natall) and Loren Jupiter&#39;s son Jarrod, aka Haze. The Atom&#39;s new growth powers were instrumental in the battle against Sekhmet of the Millennium Giants. Ray subsequently regains his original age and memories and loses his new powers after he begins to rapidly age and [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] has to use DNA taken prior to his rejuvenation to restore him to his original state. Palmer returns to his teaching job at Ivy University, but also becomes an associate and alternate member of the JLA. With his exit from the Teen Titans, the group disbands. One notable student under Palmer was [[Firestorm (comics)|Ronnie Raymond]], who, without the knowledge of elements of [[Martin Stein]], found difficulty in fully employing his abilities as Firestorm.\n\n=== &#39;&#39;Identity Crisis&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Countdown&#39;&#39; ===\n{{Main|Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Countdown to Final Crisis}}\nIn the 2004-05 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] &#39;&#39;Identity Crisis&#39;&#39;, Jean Loring kills [[Sue Dibny]], the wife of the [[Elongated Man]]. After stealing some of the Atom&#39;s shrinking technology and his costume, she kills Sue in a misguided attempt to win Palmer back. She also arranges a hit on [[Tim Drake]]&#39;s father which is carried out by [[Captain Boomerang]] (Digger Harkness). The intent is for Jack Drake to kill some random attacker, but both manage to kill each other. After committing her to [[Arkham Asylum]], Palmer shrinks himself to microscopic size and disappears.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt;\n\nPalmer eventually meets up with his old friend Carter Hall after microscopically traveling through phone lines. He warns Hall of the consequences of [[mindwiping]] [[Batman]] and of harassing criminals over a crime that is perpetrated by Jean, one of their own. Palmer explains he needs time away, and shrinks himself again after Hall agrees to keep the meeting secret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sequart.com/columns/index.php?col=10&amp;column=800] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023193057/http://www.sequart.com/columns/index.php?col=10&amp;column=800|date=October 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHis legacy lived on, however. [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]], a student of [[Physics]] in [[Hong Kong]] that corresponded with Ray Palmer via mail in the past, found a copy of his costume and shrinking device to become the current Atom. Around this same time, an unnamed teenager with powers similar to Palmer joins the Teen Titans under the name [[Molecule (comics)|Molecule]]. After a brief tenure with the team, he is later killed during a confrontation with the [[Terror Titans]].\n\nDuring the [[52 (comics)|missing year]], Palmer&#39;s technology is employed by [[Supernova (comics)|Supernova]] to shrink and grow in size in order to enter and exit the [[Kandor (comics)|bottle city of Kandor]].\n\nDC Comics would not reveal Palmer&#39;s whereabouts since his disappearance at the end of &#39;&#39;[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=101892 MEGA CON 2007: DAY ONE &amp; DCU PANEL] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303024531/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=101892 |date=March 3, 2007 }}, [[Newsarama]], February 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, Palmer returned to play a very important role in the &#39;&#39;[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]&#39;&#39; limited series. A [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] asks the [[Source Wall]] what is the solution to \&quot;the great disaster,\&quot; it answers \&quot;Ray Palmer\&quot;. Subsequently, [[Kyle Rayner]], [[Donna Troy]] and [[Jason Todd]] scour the Multiverse for the former Atom, who just might hold the key to saving reality from a crisis of unparalleled proportions.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=7935 |title=DC Comics |publisher=DC Comics |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn their travels, the quartet has found people marked with the Atom&#39;s familiar symbol. The group tracks Palmer to Earth-51, where he assumes the life of its native Palmer after his life is cut short during his studies of the Multiverse and discovery of the looming Crisis. Meeting the Jean of Earth-51 and the Justice League again for the first time, Palmer is found on a world where the heroes have been able to eradicate supercrime and create a utopian Earth (later revealed to have been the result of this reality&#39;s Batman murdering all of this world&#39;s super-criminals after the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] killed Jason Todd). However, once Kyle, Donna, Jason and [[Bob the Monitor]] are able to track him down,&lt;ref name=\&quot;countdown18\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Countdown&#39;&#39; #18 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Bob attempts to kill Palmer; with the Challengers&#39; help, Palmer escapes and reveals to the Challengers that it was the Ray Palmer of Earth-51 who was meant to stop the Great Disaster and that he had been trying to carry on his work, to no avail.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt;\n\nWhen the Challengers return to their own Earth, [[Jimmy Olsen]] is kidnapped by [[Mary Marvel]], who has been corrupted by [[Darkseid]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Countdown to Final Crisis&#39;&#39; #4 (April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer hitches a ride from within Jimmy. When Darkseid takes control of Jimmy&#39;s powers, Palmer locates and shuts down the control sphere inside Jimmy&#39;s brain, but is then swarmed by Apokoliptian antibodies. While escaping this onslaught, Palmer discovers the \&quot;battery\&quot; containing the New God spirit energies.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Countdown to Final Crisis&#39;&#39; #3 (April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer removes it from Jimmy&#39;s head and shatters it, releasing the energies.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Countdown to Final Crisis&#39;&#39; #2 (April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nPalmer later (after much cajoling) joins Donna, Kyle, and [[Forager (comics)|Forager]] in their new mission as border guards to the Multiverse, realizing that there is nothing left for him on Earth anymore.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Countdown to Final Crisis&#39;&#39; #1 (April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Palmer returns home to New Earth one more time, upon realizing that his old nemesis [[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]] had taken his identity to mislead a young pretender to his identity, [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]]. After helping his successor to once again save Ivy Town, he returns to the Multiverse with a new sense of fulfillment, leaving his town in the hands of a new, capable hero.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The All-New Atom&#39;&#39; #25&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the &#39;&#39;[[Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39;, Palmer returns to New Earth and works with Choi again to aid in the efforts to evacuate the last free humans.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Final Crisis&#39;&#39; #7 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]&#39;&#39; mini-series, it has been confirmed that Palmer will become a member of [[Hal Jordan]]&#39;s new [[Justice League]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League: Cry for Justice&#39;&#39; #1 (July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;Blackest Night&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\nOn the night of the superhero&#39;s memorial day, Palmer asks Hawkman to visit Jean&#39;s grave to be honored as a fallen member of the community, but Hawkman refuses because of what she did in &#39;&#39;[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blackest Night&#39;&#39; #1 (July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer is later shown speaking to Hawkman again, over the phone (unaware that his friend has been killed and reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]). Atom is then invited to visit undead Hawkman in order to discuss his heartache over his wife.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blackest Night&#39;&#39; #2 (August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer is later revealed to have shrunk into Hawkman&#39;s ring, escaping certain death. Joining the battle between [[Hal Jordan]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], and the Black Lanterns, Palmer is set upon by Black Lanterns Ralph and Sue Dibny, who use his guilt over Jean&#39;s actions to try to feed on his compassion-filled heart. Palmer is saved from death by the [[Indigo Tribe]], who combine their light with Hal&#39;s to destroy the Dibnys and their rings. During the crisis, Palmer was able to deduce with the heroes that the black rings are simulations taking the identities of the deceased and needing to feed. The Indigo Tribe take the heroes to the [[Hall of Justice]], unceremoniously taking Hal Jordan and abandoning the rest when the Black Lanterns renew their attack.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blackest Night&#39;&#39; #3 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nPalmer helps the heroes escape via a phone line, and then brings them to the JSA, who were also being attacked by Black Lanterns. During the crisis, Palmer meets [[Damage (DC comics)|Damage]], son of [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Al Pratt]], the first hero to be called Atom. The two heroes briefly acquainted during the battle, and begin to develop a friendship. Palmer stopped the Black Lantern Al Pratt from killing Damage, but was unable to keep the reanimated Jean from finishing the job.&lt;ref name=\&quot;bn4\&quot;/&gt; Palmer made a futile attempt to stop one of the black rings from turning Damage&#39;s corpse into an undead before Jean used his own technology to shrink him, Mera, and herself into the fully transformed Damage&#39;s ring.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blackest Night&#39;&#39; #5 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; As Palmer and Mera battle Jean inside the black ring, Jean reveals [[Nekron]]&#39;s plan along showing what is happening at [[Coast City]], as deceased residents and revived heroes arise as Black Lanterns under the demon lord&#39;s commands. [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] witnesses their battle and plans to rescue Palmer and Mera from Jean.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #49 (December 2009)- a \&quot;Tales of the Black Lantern Corps\&quot; co-feature in the issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Deadman saves Palmer and Mera by briefly possessing Jean, allowing them to escape and join the heroes against Nekron and his army. During the battle, Palmer is chosen as a deputy officer of the [[Indigo Tribe]] to be more effective against Nekron&#39;s forces. Although the Indigo Tribe eschews formal uniforms for tribal patterns over simple garments, Ray Palmer&#39;s costume is turned into a close approximation of the tattered &#39;&#39;Sword of the Atom&#39;&#39; clothings he had used in the past.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blackest Night&#39;&#39; #6 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nPalmer&#39;s past is rehashed, showing that he never quite got over Jean, even during the days of &#39;&#39;Sword of the Atom&#39;&#39;. Indigo-1 claims that she can teleport the armies of each Lantern Corps onto Earth, if given time to meditate. The responsibility falls to Palmer to protect her while she does so. Before she enters her trance, she reveals to Palmer that the indigo staff and his overwhelming compassion allows him to mimic the other powers of the Lantern Corps; she demonstrates this by temporarily becoming a Red Lantern and vomiting corrosive blood all over an attacking company of Black Lanterns. She then enters her trance, while Palmer fights off Black Lanterns Hawkman and Hawkgirl by temporarily becoming an Orange Lantern, loudly proclaiming \&quot;I want my friends back!\&quot; He then summons two orange energy duplicates of Khufu and Chay-Ara to help him fight off his and Indigo-1&#39;s attackers. He is briefly successful. But then Jean shows up to torment him, and she leaps into Indigo-1&#39;s ring. Palmer follows her. He ends up reliving Sue Dibny&#39;s death, and is then attacked by various Black Lantern Morlaidhans, the minuscule race he befriended during &#39;&#39;Sword of the Atom&#39;&#39;. He fights them off and, summoning the powers of a Green Lantern, destroys Jean. Indigo-1 manages to summon the various armies and thanks Palmer for his help. He tells her to keep his involvement in the deployment of the troops a secret, and asks that she help him find a way to legitimately resurrect Hawkman and Hawkgirl.&lt;ref name=\&quot;taah46\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;The Atom and Hawkman&#39;&#39; #46 (January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the final battle, Palmer gets his wish when Hawkman and Hawkgirl are brought back to life by power of white light at the end of the &#39;&#39;Blackest Night&#39;&#39; series.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blackest Night&#39;&#39; #8 (March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Ray&#39;s involvement of secret resurrect remains unknown.&lt;ref name=\&quot;taah46\&quot;/&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;Brightest Day&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; co-feature===\nIn July 2010 Ray Palmer had a &#39;&#39;[[Brightest Day]]&#39;&#39; one-shot that led to a co-feature in &#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39;.

He seeks out [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to find the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], Oracle manages to trace a data line, and Ray enters through the internet where he then encounters the Calculator and interrogates him to find out the dealers are. However, Calculator creates a room with no oxygen to make Atom&#39;s heartrate slower and he attempts to kill the Atom.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #516 (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Ray manages to grab Calculator and shrinks to return to Oracle&#39;s base. While Ray is in remission, he threatens Calculator who tells him that something called the Colony has manipulated Ray. Later, Prof. Hyatt was attacked by the Colony while looking for white dwarf matter.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #517 (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; When Ray arrives, he goes to rescue Prof. Hyatt. During the fight, the Colony dies by incineration from the white dwarf matter. Ray calls Oracle to trace the phone line, and while he arrives at the Colony&#39;s base he is confronted by the Colony squad.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #518 (September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter failing to avoid detection, he is confronted by Uncle David and with his help, pulls him away from the Colony heading towards the teleporter. Once safe, Uncle David tells Ray about the Colony. David also tells Ray that he could not leave and could not work on the projects on his own, he shows Ray how to travel using the astrology orb called the ant farm to see a mini-planet of microscopic nature. But, the Colony followed them to David&#39;s hideout and travels to the ant farm Ray then engages them in an epic battle.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #519 (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle the Colony died from incineration as it did before but, Ray managed to save him using his stable white dwarf matter. Ray demanded to know what they desired and the Colony tells him the same thing, and they transport the ant farm to the Colony&#39;s base.

Since they cannot return, Ray follows David with a backup plan when suddenly Ray is approached by robotic insects.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #520 (November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; David explains that the robotic insects are caretakers. They manage to fix the belt buckle and he returns to normal size when in Colony&#39;s base. Failing to escape, Ray is forced by the scientist to bring the white dwarf matter. He shows the monitor renderings where Colony is standing in front of the hospital where is father his and he is going to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #521 (December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen Ray refused, Hawkman prevents Colony from attacking Ray&#39;s father. Ray receives a call from Oracle to trace the monitor renderings, but Hawkman is being attacked by the Colony squad that miniaturize into Hawkman&#39;s body. Ray chooses to save Hawkman to leave the Colony&#39;s base while the other Colony escapes and kidnaps Ray&#39;s father. Ray rescues Hawkman by leaping into a body of the Colony attackers. When Hawkman is recovering, the Colony leaves their message to bring the white dwarf meteor and warned him no tricks, and to bring the meteor in order to save his family. While Ray traded the meteor to Colony before the Colony leaves, they exchange it for Ray&#39;s family that is in the ant farm. Ray travels into the ant farm and discovers that they planted a nuclear bomb on a vest strapped to his uncle David. Ray then manages to save his father and David and shrinks the bomb before it had a chance to detonate. While Ray&#39;s father is recovering, Ray reveals to David that he planted the white dwarf meteor into a nano-liquid to make the Colony&#39;s headquarters shrink. Ray, David, and Hawkman arrive at the location of the Colony&#39;s headquarters to attack their base. After the Colony was defeated however, David tells him there are more Colonies in the area. Later, Ray returns his father home. Ray forgives his father and apologizes for giving him a rough life before he overhears a firefighter rescue service, as he is a capable hero once more.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Giant-Size Atom&#39;&#39; (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring this same period, Ray begins an investigation into the disappearance of Ryan, whom unbeknownst to the superhero community, had been murdered by [[Deathstroke]].

Ray then engages Deathstroke in an epic battle, but Ray is being pulled by the mysterious voice of Telos to fight opposite [[Champions of Angor|Angor]] universe&#39;s Barracuda. While Ray battles Barracuda, Ryan Choi suddenly appears and to be alive, and confronts him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Convergence: The Atom&#39;&#39; #1 (April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan explains that his death and consciousness had survived in the universe where the Atoms&#39; masses are shifted to whenever they change size. Ryan then returns to the realm of the living after appropriating Ray&#39;s hand that Barracuda severed during their battle, to create a new body for him after they defeat Barracuda. Ray is hospitalized after losing his hand, and Deathstroke infiltrates the hospital and attempts to kill him, but Ryan interferes as they work together to defeat Deathstroke and restored Ray&#39;s hand.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Convergence: The Atom&#39;&#39; #2 (May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;The New 52&#39;&#39;===\nIn September 2011, &#39;&#39;[[The New 52]]&#39;&#39; rebooted DC&#39;s continuity. In this new timeline, Ray appears in &#39;&#39;[[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein: Agent of S.H.A.D.E.]]&#39;&#39; as S.H.A.D.E.&#39;s science advisor,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E.&#39;&#39; #1 (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; although he appears to have retained his abilities.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E.&#39;&#39; #7 (March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; His shrinking technology enables S.H.A.D.E. agents to enter and leave their microscopic headquarters, the Ant Farm. He later uses his size-shifting abilities to assist Superman in visiting the Bottle City of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], during which he wears a protective suit similar to the Atom costume.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman/Superman&#39;&#39; #19 (April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of this adventure he expresses an interest in becoming a superhero as the Atom.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman/Superman&#39;&#39; #20 (May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently assists Superman in costume during Superman&#39;s fight with [[Vandal Savage]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #48 (March 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;DC Rebirth&#39;&#39;===\nSubsequently, in the &#39;&#39;[[DC Rebirth]]&#39;&#39; reboot, on Earth-0, Ray Palmer is, by day, a professor at an Ivy League college and, by night, the experienced crime fighter The Atom. He reveals his secret identity to his friend and apprentice Ryan Choi, and enlists him for tech support during his adventures. After many adventures together, Ray disappears and Ryan is scolded when Ray cancels classes for the fifth day in a row. When Ryan goes to get Ray from his workshop where he has seemingly been confined for a week, he instead finds a video recording from Ray. In it he reveals he discovered a universe beyond the subatomic, a so-called Microverse while investigating a disruption in space and time, and within he found something that posed an existential threat to their universe. He asks Ryan, the only other person who knows how to use the Atom&#39;s technology and whom Ray trusts, to go into it, rescue him, and finish his work. Ray informs Ryan that upon arrival he will also meet with someone who he himself has encountered. He tries to warn Ryan about something, but the footage cuts out abruptly before he can finish.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;DC Universe: Rebirth&#39;&#39; one-shot (May 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Batman]] begins recruiting for his new Justice League of America, he chooses Ray as one the members of the new league, however when he enters Ray&#39;s office he finds Ryan instead. Ryan explains to Batman about Ray&#39;s situation so he takes Ryan as Ray&#39;s successor.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League of America: Rebirth&#39;&#39; one-shot (February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]], during his ongoing quest to reveal the mysteries of his past lives, is transported to the Microverse, where Ray has relocated. Together they recover a starship located on the living planet Moz-Ga which belonged to several of Hall&#39;s past lives.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkman #6 (October 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Atom possesses the power to alter his size down to the subatomic level while retaining his natural strength level. This is accomplished by using the remnants of a white-dwarf star made into a belt buckle worn with his costume. Originally, he had to manipulate his abilities via the belt, and later with hand movements, before eventually syncing directly with his brain via mental commands. The Atom is one of the few heroes in the DC Universe that has 100% control over his body on the molecular level ([[Plastic Man]] being another), thus making him exponentially more powerful than he is often portrayed; he is limited only by his application of his powers. Some of the applications he has demonstrated include reducing his mass to glide through the air (simulating flight, like [[Wonder Woman]]) and increasing his mass to punch through concrete. He also demonstrated the ability to make his costume appear and disappear at will by shifting its atoms between this dimension and another.\n\nDuring &#39;&#39;Countdown to Final Crisis&#39;&#39;, Palmer learned he could shrink down beyond the Subatomic scale in order to traverse the Multiverse by slipping below the quantum layer beneath reality.&lt;ref name=\&quot;cdft10\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39; #18 (December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He has been shown to be able to ride phone lines to his destination by dialing a number and traveling through the handset (his signature use of his power), and recently shrinking small enough to travel on photon signals through fiber optic cable.&lt;ref name=\&quot;bn4\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Blackest Night]]&#39;&#39; #4 (October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSome of The Atom&#39;s more impressive feats include shrinking into Superman&#39;s bloodstream and manually rearranging his molecules to create [[Kryptonite]] and defusing Black Lantern [[Atom (Al Pratt)|Al Pratt&#39;s]] Atomic Punch and resizing within him, ripping his body apart in the process.&lt;ref name=\&quot;bn4\&quot;/&gt;\n\nFollowing the events of &#39;&#39;[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]&#39;&#39;, the Atom gained the ability to also grow in size and internalizes his other abilities without the use of his white dwarf star-based apparatus. However, when returned to his natural age, these abilities were lost.\n\nAs a member of the Indigo Tribe, Ray possessed an [[Power ring (weapon)#Indigo|indigo power ring]] powered by compassion, which provided him with flight, energy projection, and a protective force field. He also utilised a staff capable of duplicating the abilities of other wielders of the Emotional spectrum within range.\n\nHe has also shown the ability to allow others to shrink down with him if the situation requires it, such as when he shrank himself, Superman, Flash, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Plastic Man to repair the links between seven shattered subatomic particles, or shrinking [[John Henry Irons|Steel]], [[Matrix (comics)|Supergirl]] and [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] to directly treat a kryptonite tumor in Superman&#39;s body. However, this ability is relatively limited; initially anyone other than himself who was shrunk would explode after two minutes if not returned to their normal size, although by the time he sent Superman&#39;s allies into the Man of Steel, he was able to extend this time to around an hour.\n\n==Supporting cast==\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Atom (comics)#Adam Cray|Adam Cray]]&#39;&#39;&#39; - The son of an assassinated senator, Adam Cray is approached by Ray Palmer to take up his mantle as the Atom in order to bring Micro/Squad into the open so Palmer can infiltrate their ranks and bring them to justice.

The C.I.A. gathered a group of America&#39;s brightest scientific minds power of the United States. Project Colony quickly developed projects and weapons systems that over the next years. The original group changed over the decades, faces and minds were constantly being and handed an unlimited budget to explore and experiment. After the Cold War ended, the group and Project Colony was officially discontinued. However, the greatest minds the country had to offer were in the middle of new experiments and projects. They reformed as a private organization, now calling ourselves simply the Colony, and continued their work in secret to America&#39;s global and [[metahuman]]. Unfortunately, the global landscape grew increasingly unstable; tension grew within their ranks.

McGinley]]. He first appears in \&quot;The Return\&quot; to help [[Lex Luthor]] defend himself against [[Amazo]] by building a [[nanotechnology]]-disabling laser that would deactivate Amazo. When it fails, Atom shrinks himself and Lex Luthor only for Amazo to follow them. In \&quot;Dark Heart\&quot; (written by [[Warren Ellis]]), Atom helps the Justice League disable a [[grey goo]]-like alien weapon known as the Dark Heart which uses nanotechnology to replicate its forces. He manages to disable it, which also deactivated its forces. The Atom&#39;s final vocalized appearance was in \&quot;Clash,\&quot; when he examined a device built by Lex Luthor which [[Superman]] had mistaken for a bomb. In \&quot;Panic in the Sky,\&quot; Atom was shown in his small form unconscious before Supergirl&#39;s fight with [[Galatea (Justice League Unlimited)|Galatea]].\n* Ray Palmer appears in the &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Sword of the Atom!\&quot; voiced by [[Peter Scolari]]. In the episode, it is revealed that Ray had been the original Atom and Ryan Choi&#39;s mentor, but that he had eventually retired and moved to the Amazon. There, he encountered the Morlaidhans and Princess Laethwyn. After teaming up with Batman, Ryan and Aquaman to defeat a traitorous and xenophobic Chancellor Deraegis, Ray chooses to stay in the Amazon as Laethwyn&#39;s lover.\n* Ray Palmer appears in &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]&#39;&#39; voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]. He is first mentioned in the episode \&quot;Agendas\&quot; where he is considered for membership in the Justice League. In episode \&quot;Usual Suspects\&quot;, Ray becomes a member of the Justice League. In episode \&quot;Auld Acquaintance\&quot;, Ray is shown as one of the infected Leaguers by the [[Starro]] Tech of Vandal Savage and then he is cured by [[Miss Martian]]. In episode \&quot;Happy New Year\&quot;, [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]] mentions that she has a lab assignment with Dr. Palmer and has to postpone a date with [[Mal Duncan]]. In \&quot;True Colors,\&quot; Atom and Bumblebee attempt a micro-surgery to get the Scarab off of [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Jaime Reyes]] only for them to be extracted when the Blue Beetle Scarab started producing antibodies to fight them off.\n* [[Jason Marsden]] reprises his role of the Atom in the &#39;&#39;[[DC Nation Shorts|DC Nation Short]]&#39;&#39; titled \&quot;Sword of the Atom.\&quot;\n* Ray Palmer appears in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Action]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Jerry O&#39;Connell]].\n\n====Live-action====\n\n* The Atom appeared in \&quot;The Roast\&quot;, the second of two 1979 live-action TV specials aired under the umbrella title &#39;&#39;[[Legends of the Superheroes]]&#39;&#39;. In \&quot;The Roast\&quot;, the Atom (played by Alfie Wise) is engaged to marry villainess [[Giganta]] (played by actress A&#39;leshia Brevard).\n* The Atom appeared in the 1997 live action TV series pilot, &#39;&#39;[[Justice League of America (1997 film)|Justice League of America]]&#39;&#39; played by [[John Kassir]].\n\n=====Arrowverse=====\n{{main|Arrowverse}}\n[[File:Atom (Brandon Routh).jpg|thumb|right|[[Brandon Routh]] as Ray Palmer/The Atom]]\n[[Brandon Routh]] portrays Dr. Raymond \&quot;Ray\&quot; Palmer / The Atom in [[The CW]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Arrowverse]]&#39;&#39;. Unlike most versions, Ray&#39;s suit does not solely shrink himself and other obejcts; instead, it was originally designed as a combat exosuit with blasters, capable of flight.\n* Ray Palmer first appears as a recurring character in &#39;&#39;[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]&#39;&#39;.\n** In [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]], Ray is a brilliant scientist (with a 140 I.Q. and 4 PhDs) and the CEO of Palmer Technologies (formerly Queen Consolidated, rebranded after he purchases it from receivership). His fianc\u00e9e, Anna Loring, was murdered by [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson/Deathstroke]]&#39;s Mirakuru men (which takes place during the [[Arrow (season 2)|second season]]), and he vows to never let anything like Slade&#39;s attack happen again. To achieve this, he devotes much of his efforts to building a high tech suit of armor with built-in weapons and flight capability, acquiring the necessary resources from various businessmen. He also has an ambition to rebuild Starling City and rechristen it \&quot;Star City\&quot;. He hires [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]] to work for him and becomes romantically attracted to her. He eventually starts dating her, much to the jealousy of [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]]. After succeeding in building his suit, the \&quot;Arrow\&quot; (in reality, Maseo Yamashiro framing Oliver on behalf of [[Ra&#39;s al Ghul (Arrowverse)|Ra&#39;s al Ghul]]) begins killing people. Ray uses his suit&#39;s x-ray vision feature to discover the real Arrow&#39;s identity as Oliver Queen. On learning of Felicity&#39;s affection towards Oliver, Ray becomes jealous and tries to apprehend him. However, Oliver defeats Ray and tells him to trust Felicity, and Ray accepts that Oliver is being framed. When Maseo tries to kill Felicity, Ray saves her, but at the cost of his being shot in the chest. He is able to survive by secretly using a new micro-technology to heal himself. Ray later realizes that Felicity is indeed in love with Oliver, and the pair have a civil break-up and decide to resume being friends. In the season finale, Ray assists Team Arrow in their attempt to stop Ra&#39;s destroying Starling City with a bio-weapon and partakes in their initial attack on the League&#39;s men in Nanda Parbat. After this fails he accompanies them back to Starling City and succeeds in dispersing the antidote, saving hundreds of lives. At the end of the episode, Ray works on a new technology to give his suit the ability to shrink, but is seemingly killed in an explosion that destroys the entire top floor of Palmer Technologies. \n** In [[Arrow (season 4)|season four]], it is revealed that the explosion, in conjunction with the micro-tech injected into him several weeks before, actually shrunk Ray and his suit to miniature sizes. For months, Ray sends distress calls to Felicity with no response, as she had left the city to be with Oliver. One of these messages is eventually intercepted by [[Damien Darhk (Arrowverse)|Damien Darhk]], leader of [[H.I.V.E.]], who captures Ray and keeps him in a miniaturized state to use his suit&#39;s powers for Darhk&#39;s own agenda. Meanwhile, the city is re-branded \&quot;Star City\&quot; in Ray&#39;s honor, and Felicity inherits Palmer Technologies as part of Ray&#39;s will. Felicity begins getting encrypted messages on her phone with him calling her name. After tearfully listening to Ray&#39;s last message, Felicity discovers Ray is alive. Team Arrow locates and rescues him and, with the help of [[Curtis Holt (Arrowverse)|Curtis Holt]], are able to restore Ray to normal size. However, seeing that Star City has not gotten any better, believing that nobody really cared that he \&quot;died\&quot;, and that Palmer Technologies is teetering on bankruptcy, Ray concludes that his past life has amounted to nothing. He elects to remain officially dead until he can figure out where he wants his new life to go, but still assists Team Arrow whenever they need help.\n* Routh portrays Ray during [[The Flash (season 1)|season one]] of &#39;&#39;[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]&#39;&#39;, in the episode \&quot;All-Star Team-Up\&quot;. Here, he helps [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen/The Flash]] deal with [[Bug-Eyed Bandit|a villain using a swarm of cybernetic bees]] to attack those who ruined her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2015/arrow-without-oliver-producers-preview-the-rise-of-black-canary-atom-and-brick-120140918/ |title=&#39;Arrow&#39; Without Oliver?

Ray also shares Cisco&#39;s love for naming super-villains; he and Cisco both come up with \&quot;Bug-Eyed Bandit\&quot;, and Cisco approves of Ray&#39;s naming another metahuman \&quot;[[Deathbolt]]\&quot; (&#39;&#39;Arrow&#39;&#39;, \&quot;Broken Arrow\&quot;). Ray is briefly mentioned in the season&#39;s penultimate episode, \&quot;Rogue Air\&quot;; when Oliver helps Barry fight [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Eobard Thawne/Reverse-Flash]], he shoots him with an arrow that delivers \&quot;nanites... courtesy of Ray Palmer\&quot; which temporarily disables Eobard&#39;s speed.\n* Routh reprises his role as Ray in the spin-off series &#39;&#39;[[Legends of Tomorrow]]&#39;&#39; as part of the main cast. \n** In the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 1)|first season]] he is recruited by time-traveler [[Rip Hunter (Arrowverse)|Rip Hunter]] to help him defeat [[Vandal Savage (Arrowverse)|Vandal Savage]] across the timeline. Ray accepts the offer as he is attracted by the thought of giving his current life meaning after seeing the waste he believes his former life to have been, although his enthusiasm and optimism still occasionally overrides his lack of practical experience.

He also begins a flirtatious friendship with [[Hawkgirl (Arrowverse)|Kendra Saunders]], which develops into a romantic relationship and ultimately an engagement. However, when another reincarnation of [[Hawkman (Arrowverse)|Carter Hall]] is located, Ray ends the relationship amicably, knowing that Kendra is meant to be with Carter. Ray also forms something of a bond with [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory/Heat Wave]], who nicknames Ray \&quot;haircut\&quot;, despite being polar opposites in personality. Mick denies any connection between them, but he has protected Ray on occasion and the two work well together, as when they take out the 1958 version of Savage and destroy his meteor before its effects can destroy time.\n** Ray returns in the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 2)|second season]], still acting as a member of the Legends. During time in 1942, Ray modifies a Super-Serum provided to the Nazis by Eobard Thawne to save the team&#39;s new ally [[Nate Heywood (Arrowverse)|Nate Heywood]] from his [[hemophilia]], giving Nate the ability to turn into a metallic skinned state. His suit is destroyed during a trip to feudal Japan when it is stolen by a ruthless local warrior, but Mick Rory gives Ray the cold gun that used to belong to the now-deceased [[Captain Cold (Arrowverse)|Leonard Snart]] so that he can still act as a hero. When the team travel to Colorado in 1874, Ray rebuilds his suit with dwarf star minerals. In the crossover episode \&quot;[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion!]]\&quot;, Ray notes that [[Supergirl (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]] looks a lot like his cousin, which is a reference to Routh&#39;s portrayal of Superman. In [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 3)|season three]], Ray begins an ambiguous relationship with Damien Darhk&#39;s daughter [[Nora Darhk|Nora]] who is played by Routh&#39;s real life wife [[Courtney Ford]] The characters during season 5 get married before leaving the waverider and the team. Ray forms a [[bromance]] with Nate and in [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 4)|season four]] agrees to become the host of the demon [[Neron (Arrowverse)|Neron]] to save Nate&#39;s life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tvmaze.com/articles/553/egg-macguffin-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-s04e13-review|title=\&quot;Egg MacGuffin\&quot; \u2013 DC&#39;s Legends of Tomorrow S04E13 Review|website=TV Maze|date=April 30, 2019|accessdate=May 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray ends up in [[Hell (Arrowverse)|hell]], where he uses his warmth and charm to befriend old Legends enemy Vandal Savage, before being rescued by Nora and [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|John Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/legends-of-tomorrow-ends-a-chaotic-season-with-somethin-1834908643|title=Legends Of Tomorrow ends a chaotic season with something sweet and storybook simple|website=[[The A.V.
