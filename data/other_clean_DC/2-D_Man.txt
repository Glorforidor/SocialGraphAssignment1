2-D Man is a villain in the Batman Beyond animated series. His powers are elasticity and the ability to be two-dimensional, which means he has a square-shaped body with virtually no curvature to his joints. Therefore, his body has no depth to it, and he resembles a thin piece of paper. His real name is Stewart Lowe, and he is a member of the villainous group The Terrific Trio.
