A stand-alone sequel to the 1992 film &#39;&#39;[[Batman Returns]]&#39;&#39; and the third installment of [[Warner Bros.]]&#39; [[Batman (1989 film series)|initial &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; film series]], it stars [[Val Kilmer]] replacing [[Michael Keaton]] as Bruce Wayne and Batman, alongside [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Chris O&#39;Donnell]], [[Michael Gough]], and [[Pat Hingle]]. The plot focuses on Batman trying to stop [[Two-Face]] and the [[Riddler]] in their villainous scheme to extract confidential information from all the minds in [[Gotham City]] and use it to learn Batman&#39;s identity and bring the city under their control. In the process, he gains allegiance from a young, orphaned circus acrobat named [[Dick Grayson]], who becomes his sidekick [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and meets and develops feelings for psychiatrist [[List of Batman supporting characters|Dr. Chase Meridian]], which brings him to the point to decide if he will lead a normal life or if he is destined to fight crime as Batman forever.\n\nSchumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton&#39;s films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic books of the [[Dick Sprang]] era, as well as the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s television series]]. After Keaton chose not to reprise his role, [[William Baldwin]] and [[Ethan Hawke]] were considered as a replacement before Val Kilmer joined the cast.\n\nThe film was released on June 16, 1995. &#39;&#39;Batman Forever&#39;&#39; grossed over $336 million worldwide and became the sixth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1995. The film received mixed reviews, with criticism directed towards the CGI, Kilmer&#39;s performance, costume designs and tonal departure from previous films, but praising the visuals, cinematography, score, and the performances of Carrey and Jones. The film was followed by &#39;&#39;[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]&#39;&#39; in 1997, with Schumacher returning as the director, Chris O&#39;Donnell returning as Robin, and [[George Clooney]] replacing Kilmer as Batman.\n\n==Plot==\n&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;\nIn [[Gotham City]], the vigilante [[Batman]] defuses a hostage situation orchestrated by a criminal known as [[Two-Face]]\u2014formerly [[district attorney]] Harvey Dent, who was disfigured with acid by mobster [[Sal Maroni]], which Batman failed to prevent\u2014but Two-Face escapes. Edward Nygma, an eccentric researcher at [[Wayne Enterprises]], approaches his employer, Bruce Wayne\u2014secretly Batman\u2014with an invention that can beam television signals into a person&#39;s brain. Bruce rejects the device, concerned the technology could manipulate minds. After killing his supervisor and staging the death as a suicide, Nygma resigns and plots revenge against Bruce, obsessively sending him riddles.\n\nBruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychologist obsessed with Batman, and invites her to the circus. Two-Face hijacks the event and threatens to detonate a bomb unless Batman surrenders himself. Acrobat Dick Grayson, the youngest member of the Flying Graysons, manages to throw the bomb into the river, but Two-Face kills his family. Bruce persuades the orphaned Dick to live at [[Wayne Manor]] as his ward, and Dick discovers Bruce is Batman. Taking the [[Batmobile]] for a joyride, Batman saves Dick from thugs; determined to avenge his family, Dick demands to join Batman in crime-fighting and kill Two-Face, but Bruce refuses.\n\nNygma, inspired by Two-Face&#39;s raid at the circus, adopts a criminal persona, the [[Riddler]], and forms an alliance with Two-Face, promising to uncover Batman\u2019s identity. They commit a series of robberies to finance Nygma\u2019s new company and mass-produce his brainwave device, the \u201cBox\u201d, which secretly steals information from users\u2019 minds. Nygma hosts a party where he goads Bruce into using the Box, before Two-Face unexpectedly arrives. As Batman, Bruce pursues Two-Face and is nearly killed, but is rescued by Dick.\n\nBatman visits Chase, who explains that she has fallen in love with Bruce. He invites her to the manor and reveals his secret identity, while Dick runs away after taking pieces of one of Bruce&#39;s [[Batsuit]]s. The Riddler and Two-Face, having discovered Bruce\u2019s secret through the Box, arrive and blow up the [[Batcave]], shooting Bruce and kidnapping Chase. As Bruce recovers, he and his butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]], use the riddles to deduce that Nygma is the Riddler. Bruce dons a new Batsuit and Dick joins him as Batman&#39;s partner, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].\n\nBatman and Robin reach Riddler and Two-Face&#39;s lair on Claw Island, where they are separated. Robin encounters Two-Face and nearly kills him, but spares his life and is captured. Batman confronts the Riddler, who reveals Chase and Robin trapped in containment tubes above a deadly drop, giving Batman the chance to save only one hostage. Instead, Batman destroys the Riddler&#39;s brainwave receiver with a [[Batarang]], overwhelming the Riddler\u2019s mind and allowing Batman to rescue Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with the flip of a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death.\n\nImprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]], the Riddler claims to know Batman\u2019s secret identity and is visited by Chase, but it is revealed that the delusional Nygma now believes he is Batman. Chase tells Bruce that his secret is safe before parting ways, and Bruce resumes his crusade as Batman with Robin as his partner.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]: After coming across the journal of his father, Wayne starts questioning his act of vengeance.

After &#39;&#39;Batman Returns&#39;&#39; was deemed too dark and inappropriate for children, with [[McDonald&#39;s]] even shutting down their Happy Meal tie-in, Warner Bros. decided that this was the primary cause of the film&#39;s financial results and asked Burton to step down in favor of another director; [[Sam Raimi]] and [[John McTiernan]] were considered, [[Joel Schumacher]] was selected by Burton. Husband-and-wife screenwriting couple Lee and Janet Scott-Batchler were brought on to write the script, and agreed with Burton that \&quot;the key element to Batman is his duality.

[[Akiva Goldsman]], who worked with Schumacher on &#39;&#39;[[The Client (1994 film)|The Client]]&#39;&#39;, was brought in to rewrite the script, deleting the initial idea of bringing in the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] as a villain with Riddler, and the return of [[Selina Kyle (Batman Returns)|Catwoman]].

Originally darker than the final product, the film&#39;s original length was closer to 2 hours and 40 minutes, according to Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the film&#39;s 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; films were given special-edition DVD releases on the same day as the &#39;&#39;[[Batman Begins]]&#39;&#39; DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, although some of the following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/opinion_scissorpuppy_forever.html | title = Batman Forever \u2013 What Could Be: A Guide to the Batman Forever Cutting Room Floor | work = Batman-On-Film.com | accessdate = December 18, 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130702174008/http://www.batman-on-film.com/opinion_scissorpuppy_forever.html | archivedate = July 2, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThere was an undercurrent theme involving Bruce having repressed memories of an aspect of his parents&#39; death that he hadn&#39;t faced. His memories involved finding his father&#39;s diary on the night of his parents&#39; wake and reading that Bruce insisted that his parents must go to the theater, so he could watch one of the shows\u2014meaning he became Batman out of guilt that he was responsible for their deaths.\n\nMany scenes were filmed but deleted; others had footage removed. These included:\n\n* The escape of Two-Face from Arkham Asylum. [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] had another scene filmed here in the role of Doctor Burton, but his role was reduced in the final film. He discovers Two-Face&#39;s escape, encountering his psychologist hanged in Two-Face&#39;s cell with \&quot;The Bat Must Die\&quot; written in blood on the wall. This was supposed to be the film&#39;s opening scene, but producers decided this was far too dark for a family audience. This scene appears in the comic adaptation and the novelization. Segments of the scene also appears on the U2 music video of \&quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me.\&quot;\n* When Two-Face addresses the crowd from the helicopter in the opening action scene, the speech was truncated and several lines that appeared in the Theatrical Trailer were removed, including the line \&quot;If the Bat wants to play, we&#39;ll play!\&quot;\n*In the bank heist at the beginning of the film, after Two-Face&#39;s men shoots the elevator, Batman appeared and asks the men and Two-Face, \&quot;Going Down?\&quot; His line was cut and only appeared in the film&#39;s trailer.\n* There was a sequence that contained an extended fight scene between Two-Face and Batman, where they struggle for control of the helicopter. Two-Face accuses Batman of being \&quot;a killer too\&quot; (a continuity reference to the previous Burton films), then manages to escape by parachute after Batman realizes he has locked the steering wheel into position. This sequence is included in rough form on the special-edition DVD.\n* A scene right before Nygma arrives at Wayne Manor. It featured Bruce Wayne watching a local Gotham talk show with Chase Meridian as a guest, talking about Batman.\n* One scene right before Riddler and Two-face team up featured a little conversation with Dick and Bruce in the gym of the manor. This would explain why Dick suddenly has martial arts training. This scene appears in a rough edit on the special-edition DVD.\n* The scene where the Riddler fails to punch a security guard out. The guard is then brutally beaten by the Riddler using his cane. In the theatrical trailer, this guard is punched by Two-Face.\n* One sequence came directly after the casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He shows up at the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), where a roomful of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile&#39;s tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the special-edition DVD.\n* The construction of NygmaTech was after Batman solves the third riddle and was more in-depth. There were scenes shot that appear in publicity stills of Nygma with a hard hat helping with the construction of his headquarters on Claw Island.\n* Sugar and Spice, played by [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Debi Mazar]], try out the Riddler&#39;s device during the montage when it goes on sale. They are seated with the Riddler and Two-Face on the couch where Chase is handcuffed later in the film. This scene appears in the comic book adaptation, but not in the final film.\n* There was originally a scene after the montage of Alfred and Bruce examining the NygmaTech \&quot;Box.\&quot;\n* An extended scene established Bruce in the Batcave shortly after having discussed with Dick then that this would have saved his life after the battle with Two-Face in the subway system under construction. In this scene he is appreciated as the GNN news (Bruce watching in the Batcomputer) attacking Batman and Two-Face after the battle in the Subway and after that Bruce talking to Alfred turns into the dilemma of continuing to be Batman and try a normal life with Chase. Like the deleted Helicopter fight sequence, this scene also makes reference to Batman being \&quot;a killer\&quot;, and in the original production screenplay, this scene was to contain footage from &#39;&#39;[[Batman Returns]]&#39;&#39;, specifically the rooftop fight scene with [[Selina Kyle (Batman Returns)|Catwoman]]. This explains why in the theatrical version Bruce turns off all the systems in the Batcave telling Dick he gives up being Batman. This scene appears in a rough form on the special-edition DVD.\n* Another scene in the Wayne Manor raid sequence was longer, featuring Bruce and Chase fighting Two-Face and his thugs.\n* The scene involving Chase Meridian on the couch originally included a longer ending where the Riddler injects her with a green sleeping agent so he can easily place her in the small tube with the trap door.\n* Another deleted scene involved Bruce waking up after being shot in the head by Two-Face, temporarily forgetting his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the [[Batmobile]] was, and Alfred says, \&quot;Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave.\&quot; The platform then rotates downward to another level where the [[sonar]]-modification equipment is kept, from the special [[Batsuit]] to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the giant bat that inspired him to become Batman. Inside he finds his father&#39;s red diary which he had dropped when he first fell into the Batcave after his parents death. He reads the entry about him insisting his parents take him to the theater to see a show the same night they were killed. He realizes he had misread it, and his father had written &#39;even though Bruce insists, we wanted to see Zorro so his show will have to wait until next week&#39;. Bruce realizes his parents death was not his fault after all. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms to match the wing anatomy of the bat and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter [[Akiva Goldsman]] admitted the scene was very theatrical on the special-edition DVD and felt it would have made a difference to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by [[Rick Baker]], who was in charge of the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special-edition DVD.\n* The fight scene between Two-Face and Robin on Claw Island was originally longer.\n* The original ending was similar in style to the previous Batman films, which had involved a scene with Alfred in the limousine, the camera tracking upward through the Gotham cityscape, followed by a rooftop shot involving a silhouetted hero (Batman in the original, Catwoman in &#39;&#39;[[Batman Returns]]&#39;&#39;) facing the Bat Signal. When Alfred drives Doctor Chase Meridian back to Gotham, she asks him: \&quot;Does it ever end, Alfred?\&quot; Alfred replies: \&quot;No, Doctor Meridian, not in this lifetime...\&quot; The [[Bat-Signal]] shines on the night sky and Batman is standing on a pillar looking ahead. Robin then comes into shot and joins his new partner. They both leap off the pillar, towards the camera. A rough edit of the first half of the scene appears on the special-edition DVD, but not in its entirety.\n\n===Schumacher Cut===\nAfter Joel Schumacher died in June 2020, media outlets starting reporting the possible existence of a \&quot;Schumacher Cut.\&quot; This version was believed to be darker and contain less camp than the theatrical cut. Some of the differences include Bruce facing off against a human-sized bat, the darker, more serious tone, less of an emphasis on Dick Grayson, and a focus on Bruce&#39;s psychological issues with Chase.
