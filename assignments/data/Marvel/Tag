The Hellions have always been portrayed as rivals of various teams of younger [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] heroes in the [[X-Men]] [[Media franchise|franchise]], initially as actual villains and later on a team that was more of a school rival than actual enemies of the X-Men.\n\nThe first and most notable incarnation of the Hellions were students of [[Emma Frost]] and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]&#39;s [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]], and were rivals of the [[New Mutants]]. The original Hellions first appeared in &#39;&#39;New Mutants&#39;&#39; #16 (June 1984), created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the Hellions ended after an attack by [[Trevor Fitzroy]] and a squadron of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] that killed several Hellions.\n\nTwo later groups known as the Hellions or New Hellions both fought against various X groups such as [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] and [[X-Force]].\n\nIn &#39;&#39;New X-Men: Academy X&#39;&#39; a new group of Hellions were introduced, this time they were a part of the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]], the Hellions was one of several factions that the students were divided into including the New Mutants, with whom they had a rivalry. After the majority of mutants lost their powers in the &#39;&#39;[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]&#39;&#39; storyline the Hellions were combined into one squad as the number of mutants was greatly reduced.\n\n==Hellions (Massachusetts Academy)==\n{{Infobox comics organization &lt;!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--&gt;\n|image=NewMutants16.jpg\n|imagesize=\n|caption=The Hellions battle their rivals, the New Mutants, in their first appearance.

While attending classes at Frost&#39;s [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]], these young [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] secretly trained in the use of their powers in an underground complex beneath the school. They were longtime rivals of the [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]&#39;s students, the [[New Mutants]], and once held their own against the [[X-Men]].

This granted her razor sharp claws, enhanced senses and physical attributes, plus a prehensile tail.

She could also materialize and animate tangible images of the 2-D avatars/images on her tarot cards. Once materialized they are completely under her mental control and could do her bidding including aiding her in battle and flight. \n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Warpath (comics)|Thunderbird]]&#39;&#39;&#39; (James Proudstar), the younger brother of deceased X-Man [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|John Proudstar]] (the original Thunderbird), who possessed similar superhuman physical attributes, senses, and healing ability. He reformed and has served on the several X-Men teams under the codename, &#39;&#39;&#39;Warpath&#39;&#39;&#39;, and is currently a member of the X-Men.\n\nWhite Queen Emma Frost had another potential Hellion in [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] (Angelica Jones), but kept the girl from joining the team on field missions while grooming her to be Frost&#39;s personal assassin. Firestar eventually learned of Frost&#39;s plans and left the Massachusetts Academy.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Firestar&#39;&#39; #1\u20134&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter suffering a severe trauma at the hands of the [[Beyonder]],&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Wars II&#39;&#39; #9&lt;/ref&gt; a number of the New Mutants were transferred to the Massachusetts Academy by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] (then headmaster of [[X-Mansion|Xavier&#39;s School for Gifted Youngsters]]), due to their apparent need for psychic therapy from Emma Frost.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #38&lt;/ref&gt; While at the Academy, the transferred New Mutants \u2014 [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]], and [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] \u2014 were inducted into the Hellions.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #39&lt;/ref&gt; They soon returned to Xavier&#39;s School after their recovery and the revelation that the White Queen had employed Empath to coerce Magneto into allowing the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #40&lt;/ref&gt; After an alliance between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #209&lt;/ref&gt; and Magneto&#39;s ascension to the Inner Circle as its White King,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #51&lt;/ref&gt; relations between the Hellions and New Mutants improved.\n\nMagma, realizing she held feelings for Empath, eventually returned to the Hellions and the Massachusetts Academy;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #56-57&lt;/ref&gt; the two would later leave the team to travel to her home in Nova Roma.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #62&lt;/ref&gt; James Proudstar also left the Hellions, reemerging with [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the remnants of the New Mutants in [[X-Force]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The New Mutants&#39;&#39; #99&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSuperstrong and durable Beef (Buford Wilson) and bioelectricity-projecting Bevatron (Fabian Marechal-Julbin) were later additions to the group. They were present when the Hellions unsuccessfully challenged the [[New Warriors]] over the allegiance of their former member, Firestar.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;New Warriors&#39;&#39; #9\u201310&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe original Hellions however came to an end when [[Trevor Fitzroy]] and a squadron of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] attacked a Hellfire Club function; Jetstream and Beef were killed immediately,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #281&lt;/ref&gt; while Tarot, the rest of the Hellions and many guests erroneously believed to be unnamed Hellions were captured and drained of their life energies by Fitzroy.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #282&lt;/ref&gt; Emma Frost&#39;s guilt over her students&#39; deaths led to her eventual reform.\nThese Hellions were some of the many deceased mutants resurrected via the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]] by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] and [[Eli Bard]] during the \&quot;[[Necrosha]]\&quot; storyline running through &#39;&#39;[[New Mutants#New Mutants .28vol. 3.29|New Mutants]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[X-Force#2008 ongoing series|X-Force]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[X-Men: Legacy#X-Men: Legacy|X-Men: Legacy]]&#39;&#39;. They survived and are once again acting as a team.\n\nWith the establishing of the new sovereign mutant nation of Krakoa, the original Hellions and Bevatron, now free of the Transmode Virus, have all taken up residence there.\n\n==Emplate&#39;s Hellions==\nThe next group of Hellions was organized by the parasitic [[Emplate]] to attack [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], the new class of Emma Frost&#39;s students.
