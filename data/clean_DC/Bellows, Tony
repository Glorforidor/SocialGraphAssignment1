It is based on the DC Comics character Barry Allen / Flash, a costumed superhero crime-fighter with the power to move at superhuman speeds. The Flash starred John Wesley Shipp as Allen, along with Amanda Pays, and Alex D\u00e9sert.\nMultiple references to the series have been made on the 2014 Flash television series, including Shipp portraying multiple characters. Shipp also reprised his role as Barry Allen from this series in the crossover \&quot;Elseworlds\&quot;, which established The Flash as existing on a parallel Earth to the Arrowverse series.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nBarry Allen, a forensic scientist working for the Central City police, is struck by lightning and doused in chemicals in his lab. He develops superspeed and creates a superhero identity for himself to fight crime: The Flash. Research scientist Dr. Tina McGee works at S.T.A.R. Labs and helps Barry fight crime while trying to understand how his powers are developing.

Television tried to develop television films based on some DC Comics characters for CBS. Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo conceived one that featured several superheroes, including the Flash, though their project was not made. In January 1990, new CBS Entertainment president Jeff Sagansky expressed interest in creating a series featuring the Flash, and The Flash was announced a few months after.Bilson and De Meo were tapped to write the pilot episode, which they completed in January 1990. Filming for the episode took six weeks, from May through June 1990. The final effects for the pilot were completed a week before airing in September 1990. Bilson said, \&quot;There are 125 special effects. It&#39;s done on a grand scale.\&quot; The 2-hour pilot cost $6 million, and each subsequent episode of The Flash cost around $1.6 million to produce.\n\n\n=== Costumes ===\nThe four Flash suits made for the series for John Wesley Shipp cost a total of $100,000. On the suit, De Meo said, \&quot;John had to have his entire body cast. The suit is made out of latex. It was quite a process getting it.\&quot; Bilson added, \&quot;The suit was critical. You can&#39;t, after Batman, have a guy running around in tights.\&quot; The Flash&#39;s costume was designed and created by Robert Short, and built by Stan Winston Studios. Short said the latex suits were specially treated to disguise their rubber surface so they would look like basic stretch unitards, and Shipp wore a water-cooled undergarment to combat the heat of the suits. Bob Miller, costumer on the series, gave Amanda Pays \&quot;unaggressive clothing\&quot; though she is \&quot;an aggressive career woman,\&quot; with retro 1930s and &#39;40s long tapered skirts, pleated slacks and vests.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nDanny Elfman composed the series&#39; title theme, and Shirley Walker composed each episode score for a full orchestra. In 2010, a limited-edition two-disc soundtrack was released by La-La Land Records, featuring Elfman&#39;s theme and the scores by Walker for the pilot and the episodes \&quot;Captain Cold\&quot;, \&quot;The Trickster\&quot;, \&quot;Watching the Detectives\&quot;, \&quot;Ghost in the Machine\&quot;, \&quot;Done With Mirrors\&quot;, \&quot;Fast Forward\&quot; and \&quot;Trial of the Trickster\&quot;.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Broadcast ===\nThe Flash was originally scheduled to debut on CBS in the 8 pm (EST) slot on Thursday, to go against The Cosby Show on NBC, in an attempt to attract younger viewers, before Fox moved The Simpsons from Sunday to the Thursday 8 pm slot for the same reason. After debuting on September 20, 1990, at 8 pm, CBS moved the series to 8:30 pm with its second episode, in an attempt to broadcast opposite less formidable competition in Fox&#39;s Babes, NBC&#39;s A Different World and the second half-hour of ABC&#39;s Father Dowling Mysteries. Eventually, CBS moved the series off Thursdays entirely, moving the show to Saturday nights. Had the show continued, it was revealed the second season would have opened with the Flash&#39;s rogues teaming up to take down the hero.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nWarner Bros. Television and CBS began its promotion of the series in July 1990 during the 1990 NBA All-Star Game. It also had ad campaigns on radio and cable television during \&quot;wrestling matches on USA Cable and during [Batman airings] on the Family Channel\&quot;, as well as ads in The Flash comic book and posters for the series in malls and Kmarts across the country. Four-minute promos of the series aired at all Six Flags amusement parks and a few weeks before the pilot&#39;s debut, Warner Bros. flew banners over beaches on both coasts. Describing the marketing, George Schweitzer, senior vice president of communications at the CBS Broadcast Group said, \&quot;It&#39;s not being sold as a comic book. It&#39;s being sold like Batman [the 1989 film] \u2013 dark and mysterious and exciting. The promos have a theatrical quality.\&quot; The pilot debuted on July 15, 1990 at a \&quot;big bash\&quot; at the Warner Bros. Burbank lot.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe Flash was released on DVD in January 2006.Several episodes were edited as three TV movies and released on VHS:\n\nThe Flash (1990). The 2-hour pilot episode.\nThe Flash II: Revenge of the Trickster (1991). Formed by the episodes \&quot;The Trickster\&quot; and \&quot;The Trial of the Trickster\&quot;\nThe Flash III: Deadly Nightshade (1991). Formed by  the episodes \&quot;Ghost in the Machine\&quot; and \&quot;The Deadly Nightshade\&quot;.Laser-disc:\n\nThe Flash (1990). The 2-hour pilot episode.\n\n\n== Other media ==\n\n\n=== Comic book ===\nA comic book tie-in special based on the TV series was published by DC Comics in 1991 titled The Flash TV Special #1, running at 76 pages. It features two stories, one written by John Byrne with art by Javier Saltares, and the second written by then-writer of the ongoing Flash (vol. 2) title, Mark Waid featuring a thief Kid Flash; plus a behind-the-scenes look on the making of the TV series with photos.\n\n\n=== Video game ===\nA video game was released for Game Boy in 1991 by THQ, and was based on the TV series. It was released in the US and had a password system. A second game was programmed by Probe Entertainment and released only in Europe for the Master System in 1993.\n\n\n== Arrowverse ==\n\nThe 2014 television series, The Flash, features several references to the 1990 series. John Wesley Shipp plays the recurring role of Barry Allen&#39;s father, Henry Allen, and Amanda Pays once again portrays a character named Dr. Tina McGee. Shipp eventually portrays the Earth-3 version of Henry Allen, Jay Garrick / Flash. Regarding the difference in his portrayal of Garrick over Allen, Shipp \&quot;figured Jay is my version of Barry\&quot; from the 1990 series, adding, \&quot;I went back and I watched a couple of episodes of the 1990/91 version to kind of remind myself what I did. [Jay] is much more reminiscent of my Barry Allen from 25 years ago than my Henry Allen. I went back and I was amazed how much attitude my Barry Allen had in some situations. I went back and I picked up that thread and I brought it forward 25 years, and tried to weave it in.\&quot; In \&quot;Welcome to Earth-2\&quot;, as Barry, Cisco Ramon and Harry Wells are traveling to Earth-2, glimpses of the multiverse are seen, including an image of Shipp as the Flash from the 1990 series, implying that the series was retroactively being added to the Arrowverse-multiverse.In the episode \&quot;Tricksters\&quot;, Mark Hamill returns as James Jesse / Trickster, with images of Hamill as Trickster from the 1990 TV series being used in a police report, and Vito D&#39;Ambrosio plays Mayor Anthony Bellows; a variation of a police officer character he played in 1991, though a later episode revealed Mayor Bellows was formerly an officer. 2014 series composer Blake Neely incorporated Walker&#39;s theme for the Trickster into the episode. Alex D\u00e9sert reprises the role of Julio Mendez in the series&#39; third-season episode, \&quot;Flashpoint\&quot;, where he is the captain of the Central City Police Department in the Flashpoint timeline. Corinne Bohrer reprises her role as Zoey Clark / Prank in the fourth season episode, \&quot;The Elongated Knight Rises,\&quot; which also featured stills of her from the 1990 show in her police file.Shipp reprises his role as Barry Allen from this series in the 2018 Arrowverse crossover, \&quot;Elseworlds\&quot;. The crossover also links the 1990 series to the Arrowverse, designating its world as Earth-90. Danny Elfman&#39;s theme accompanied the Earth-90 Flash&#39;s appearance into the episodes. He attempts to warn the heroes of Earth-1 about Mar Novu / The Monitor to prevent a similar devastation that his own world suffered before Novu breaches him away. The character reappears in the following year&#39;s crossover, \&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths\&quot;, having been captured by the Anti-Monitor and forced to power his anti-matter cannon to destroy the multiverse. Despite being freed by Earth-1 Flash and his allies, he ultimately sacrifices himself to destroy the machine, seeing his life with Tina (whom he had married at some point) flash before his eyes in the form of a clip from the original series. After the filming of the scene, John Wesley Shipp told The Flash showrunner Eric Wallace, \&quot;Thank you for giving me this opportunity to close a chapter.\&quot;\n\n\n== See also ==\nBirds of Prey\nJustice League of America\nAquaman\nSuper Friends\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Flash on IMDb\nThe Flash at TV.com\nThe Flash II: Revenge of the Trickster on IMDb\nFlash III: Deadly Nightshade on IMDb\nEpisode Guide from SciFi.com\nCrimson Lightning - A blog featuring regular reviews of The Flash television series.\nInterview about the series with lead actor John Wesley Shipp\nPet Fly Podcast Page Including a downloadable commentary track in which series developers Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo discuss the \&quot;Trial of the Trickster\&quot; episode\nThe TV series on Hyperborea&quot;</span>
