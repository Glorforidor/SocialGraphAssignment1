Created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]], Iron Fist first appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #15 (May 1974). The character is a practitioner of [[martial arts]] and the wielder of a mystical force known as the Iron Fist, which allows him to summon and focus his ''[[Qi|chi]]''. This ability is obtained from the city of K'un-Lun which opens every fifteen years. He starred in his own solo series in the 1970s, and shared the title ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' for several years with [[Luke Cage]], partnering with Cage to form the superhero team [[Heroes for Hire]]. The character has starred in numerous solo titles since, including ''[[The Immortal Iron Fist]]'', which expanded on his origin story and the history of the Iron Fist.\n\nIron Fist has been adapted to appear in several animated television series and video games. [[Finn Jones]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] live-action television series ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', and the [[Luke Cage (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n[[Image:Amazing-Man Comics 5 page 05.jpg|thumb|[[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|Amazing-Man]] in ''Amazing-Man Comics'' #5 (Sept. 1939). Art by Bill Everett]]\nIron Fist, along with the previously created [[Shang-Chi]], Master of Kung Fu, came from [[Marvel Comics]] during an American [[popular culture|pop culture]] trend in the early to mid-1970s of [[martial arts]] heroes. Writer/co-creator [[Roy Thomas]] wrote in a text piece in ''Marvel Premiere'' #15 that Iron Fist's origin and creation owe much to the [[Bill Everett]] character, [[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|John Aman, the Amazing-Man]], created in 1939. Thomas later wrote that he and artist/co-creator [[Gil Kane]] had\n\n{{quote|...started \"Iron Fist\" because I'd seen my first [[kung fu]] movie, even before a [[Bruce Lee]] one came out, and it had a thing called \"the ceremony of the Iron Fist\" in it.

As the ''Marvel Premiere'' issues had successfully established a considerable readership for the character,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brennaman|first=Chris |title=Marvel Premiere|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=25 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> following this run, Iron Fist was immediately spun off into the solo series ''Iron Fist'', which ran 15 issues (November 1975 \u2013 September 1977). The solo series was written by Claremont and pencilled by Byrne. A subplot involving the [[Steel Serpent]] left unresolved by the cancellation of the series was wrapped up in issues #63\u201364 of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]''.\n\nTo rescue the character from cancellation, Marvel paired Iron Fist with another character who was no longer popular enough to sustain his own series, [[Luke Cage]].<ref name=\"back45\">{{cite journal |last=Callahan |first=Timothy |date=December 2010 |title=Power Man and Iron Fist |journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=45 |pages= 3\u201311 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The two characters were partnered in a three-part story in Cage's series ''Power Man'' #48\u201350. The title of the series changed to ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' with issue #50 (April 1978), although the [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] did not reflect this change until issue #67. Iron Fist co-starred in the series until the final issue (#125, September 1986), in which he is killed. Writer Jim Owsley (subsequently known as [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]]) later commented, \"Fist's death was senseless and shocking and completely unforeseen. It took the readers' heads clean off. And, to this day, people are mad about it. Forgetting, it seems, that (a) you were supposed to be mad, that death is senseless and Fist's death was supposed to be senseless, or that (b) this is a comic book.\"<ref name=\"back45\"/>\n\nIron Fist was revived half a decade later in ''[[Namor]], the Sub-Mariner'' #21\u201325 (December 1991 \u2013 April 1992), a story which revealed that the character killed in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125 was a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]]. The story was both written and drawn by Byrne, who found the manner of Iron Fist's death objectionable and later commented, \"In one of those amazing examples of Marvel serendipity, it turned out to be fairly easy not only to resurrect Danny, but to make it seem like that was the plan all along.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lantz|first=James Heath |title=Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner: Scion of the Deep or Royal Pain?|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=91|pages=57\u201358 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=September 2016|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Iron Fist then became a frequently starring character in the anthology series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', featuring in three multi-part [[story arc]]s and four one-shot stories in 1992 and 1993. Two solo [[miniseries]] followed: ''Iron Fist'' (vol. 2) #1\u20132 (September\u2013October 1996), by writer [[James Felder]] and penciller Robert Brown; and ''Iron Fist'' (vol. 3) #1\u20133 (July\u2013September 1998), by writer [[Dan Jurgens]] and penciller [[Jackson Guice]]. Also around this time, he was among the ensemble of the group series ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' which ran 19 issues (July 1997 \u2013 January 1999).\n\nFollowing a four-issue miniseries by writer [[Jay Faerber]] and penciller [[Jamal Igle]], ''Iron Fist: Wolverine'' (November 2000 \u2013 February 2001), co-starring the [[X-Men]] character [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and cover-billed as ''Iron Fist/Wolverine: The Return of K'un-Lun'', came another solo miniseries, ''Iron Fist'' vol. 4 #1\u20136 (May\u2013October 2004), by writer [[Jim Mullaney]] and penciller Kevin Lau. Subsequently, a new Iron Fist series premiered called ''[[The Immortal Iron Fist]]''. The series was written jointly by [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Matt Fraction]] from issues #1\u201314 (January 2007 \u2013 June 2008) with artists [[Travel Foreman]] and [[David Aja]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=8624 |title=Iron Drawing Hand: Aja talks \"The Immortal Iron Fist\" |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=February 21, 2007 }}</ref> Fraction wrote issues #15 and 16 alone.

He made guest appearances in such titles as ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'', ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', the Submariner series ''Namor'', ''[[Black Panther (Marvel Comics)|Black Panther]]'', and ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''.\n\nIron Fist appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010\u20132013 ''New Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue, #34 (January 2013). In 2014 Iron Fist was given new life and set to star in a new 12-issue comic book series written and drawn by [[Kaare Andrews]] titled ''Iron Fist: The Living Weapon'' as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!#All-New Marvel NOW!|All-New Marvel NOW!]]'' event.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=50154</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Background===\nDanny Rand was born in New York City. His father, [[Wendell Rand]], as a young boy happened upon the mystical city of [[K'un-L'un]]. During his time in K'un-L'un, Wendell saved the life of the city's ruler, Lord Tuan, and was adopted as Tuan's son. However, Wendell eventually left K'un-L'un and became a wealthy entrepreneur in the United States. He married socialite [[Heather Rand|Heather Duncan]] and had a child, Daniel.\n\nWendell later organizes an expedition to again seek out K'un-L'un, taking his wife Heather, his business partner [[Harold Meachum]] and nine-year-old Danny. During the journey up the mountain, Danny slips off the path, his tie-rope taking his mother and father with him. Meachum, who also loves Heather, forces Wendell to plunge to his death but offers to rescue Heather and Danny. She rejects his help. Heather and Danny come across a makeshift bridge that appears out of nowhere and are attacked by a pack of wolves. Heather throws herself on the wolves to save Danny and is killed even as archers from K'un-L'un attempt to save her. The archers take the grieving Danny to see [[Yu-Ti]], the hooded ruler of K'un-L'un. When Danny expresses his desire for vengeance, Y\u00fc-Ti apprentices him to [[Lei Kung (comics)|Lei Kung]] the Thunderer, who teaches him martial arts.\n\nDanny proves to be the most gifted of Lei Kung's students. He toughens his fists by plunging them into buckets of sand, gravel, and rock. At 19, Danny is given the chance to attain the power of the Iron Fist by fighting and defeating the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] [[Shou-Lao]] the Undying, who guards the molten heart that had been torn from its body. Guessing that the heart provides life energy to Shou-Lao through the dragon-shaped scar on its chest, Danny covers the scar with his own body and hangs on until Shou-Lao collapses and dies, in the process burning a dragon brand into his own chest. Having killed Shou-Lao, he enters its cave and plunges his fists into a brazier containing the creature's molten heart, emerging with the power of the Iron Fist. It is later revealed that Danny is part of a long lineage of Iron Fists.\n\nWhen K'un-L'un reappears on Earth after 10 years, Danny leaves to find his father's killer. Returning to New York, Danny Rand, dressed in the ceremonial garb of the Iron Fist, seeks out Harold Meachum, now head of Meachum Industries. After overcoming a number of attempts on his life, he confronts Meachum in his office, only to find the man legless&mdash;an amputation carried out when, after abandoning Danny and his mother, he was caught in heavy snow and his legs became frostbitten.\n\nMeachum accepts his fate and tells Iron Fist to kill him. Overcome with pity, Iron Fist walks away. At that moment Meachum is murdered by a mysterious ninja, and his daughter Joy blames Iron Fist for the death.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #15\u201318</ref> Eventually, Iron Fist clears his name and begins a career as a superhero, aided by his friends [[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #21</ref> Notable adversaries in his early career include [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], the mysterious [[Master Khan]] (whom the ninja that killed Meachum once served), and the [[Steel Serpent]], the exiled son of Lei Kung, who coveted the Iron Fist power.\n\n===Heroes for Hire===\nWhile working undercover, Misty Knight infiltrates the organization of crime lord [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#John McIver|John Bushmaster]]. When Bushmaster discovers Knight's treachery, he kidnaps [[Claire Temple]] and Noah Burstein, close associates of [[Luke Cage]], better known as Power Man, and holds them hostage to force Cage to eliminate Knight. Iron Fist is on hand to stop him, however, and after a battle, the truth comes out. Rand helps Cage and the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] (Knight and Wing) battle Bushmaster, rescue Temple and Burstein, and obtain evidence that proves Cage's innocence of prior drug charges. Afterwards, Iron Fist and Power Man become partners, forming [[Heroes for Hire]], Inc.<ref>''Power Man'' #48\u201350</ref>\n\nIron Fist, in his [[secret identity]] of Danny Rand, resumes control of his parents' fortune as half of Rand-Meachum, Inc., making him quite wealthy.{{issue|date=March 2014}} This causes tension between Rand and Cage, who was raised poor.\n\nPower Man and Iron Fist's partnership ends when Rand is diagnosed with cancer and gets kidnapped as part of a plot masterminded by [[Master Khan]]. Just prior to a battle with the Black Dragon Chiantang (the brother of the mythical Dragon King), Danny is replaced by a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] created by the extra-dimensional [[H'ylthri]].<ref>behind the scenes in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #120</ref> The double (who wears a red variant of the Iron Fist costume) is killed by Captain Hero a short time later. Cage, now the prime suspect in Rand's apparent death, becomes a fugitive.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125</ref>\n\n===Resurrection===\nWhile in stasis in K'un-L'un with the H'ylthri, Iron Fist manages to focus his ''chi'', curing the cancer. He is later freed from stasis by [[Namor]].<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #22\u201324</ref>\n\nRand and Cage reform Heroes for Hire, Inc. with an expanded team, this time working for Namor's Oracle Corporation. Namor ultimately dissolves Oracle as well as Heroes for Hire, Inc.\n\nIron Fist later loses his powers to Junzo Muto,<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol. 2) #8\u201310</ref> the young leader of [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]], and subsequently becomes the guardian of a pack of displaced dragons in Tokyo.<ref>''Iron Fist/Wolverine'' #1\u20134</ref> His powers are eventually restored by Chiantang, who brainwashes Iron Fist and forces him to battle [[Black Panther (Marvel Comics)|Black Panther]]. Black Panther is able to free Iron Fist from the creature's control, and the two work together to defeat the Black Dragon in [[Wakanda]].<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol. 2) #38\u201340</ref>\n\nIn the ''Iron Fist'' miniseries, [[Miranda Rand]]-K'ai also returns from the dead. The H'ylthri revive her and promise to restore her to full life if she retrieves the extra-dimensional artifact known as the Zodiac Key. To this end, she takes the identity of Death Sting, bringing her into conflict with Iron Fist as well as with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] When the H'ylthri try to kill Iron Fist, Miranda turns the power of the Zodiac Key against them, seemingly killing herself in the process. However, exposure to chemicals from the H'ylthri pods prevented her death.\n\n===Posing as Daredevil===\nRand disguises himself as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] to convince the media and the public that Matt Murdock is not the masked vigilante.<ref>''Daredevil'' #87</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', he opposes the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], joining [[Captain America]] while still pretending to be Daredevil.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Rand is apprehended by Pro-Registration forces.<ref>''Civil War'' #5</ref> He is later freed from the Negative Zone Prison, joining Captain America's team to battle [[Iron Man]]'s forces.<ref>''Civil War'' #6</ref>\n\n===New Avengers===\nAfter the arrest of Captain America, Rand joins the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], an underground group provided with secure accommodation by [[Doctor Strange]] and which includes his former teammate Luke Cage.<ref>''New Avengers'' #27</ref> In the public eye, Rand is able to avoid arrest with legal loopholes.<ref>''New Avengers'' #29</ref> Rand leaves the New Avengers, due to a variety of problems, but lets them know, if they ever need him, to give him a call.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He later aids the New Avengers in locating and rescuing Cage from [[Norman Osborn]] after he suffered a heart attack and was summarily taken into custody as a fugitive.<ref>''New Avengers'' #59</ref>\n\n===''The Immortal Iron Fist''===\n{{Main|The Immortal Iron Fist}}\n\nOrson Randall, Danny Rand's immediate predecessor, seeks out Danny Rand in New York and gives him The Book of the Iron Fist, a sacred ledger supposedly containing all the kung fu secrets of previous Iron Fists, which Randall claims will be necessary if Rand is to compete successfully in the coming tournament of the Seven Champions.{{issue|date=July 2014}} The [[Steel Serpent]], whose powers have been greatly augmented by the [[Crane Mother]], dispatches Randall.

The corruption of the leaders of the Seven Cities of Heaven spurs Iron Fist, Lei Kung, Orson Randall's daughter, and [[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|John Aman]] to plan a revolution.{{issue|date=July 2014}} Iron Fist discovers that Crane Mother and Xao, a high-ranking HYDRA operative, are planning to destroy K'un-Lun by using a portal. Upon learning of the plot, Steel Serpent helps Rand and the other Immortal Weapons defeat Xao.{{issue|date=July 2014}}\n\nRand destroys the train intended to destroy [[K'un-L'un]] by extending his ''chi'' to find the train's electromagnetic field. Meanwhile, the revolution orchestrated by Lei Kung and Orson's daughter proves successful, with Nu-an, the Yu-Ti of K'un-Lun fleeing in terror. When Rand confronts Xao, Xao reveals that there is an eighth city of Heaven before killing himself. Rand suggests Lei Kung as the new Yu-Ti, with Orson's unnamed daughter as the new Thunderer.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #13</ref>\n\nAfter learning that the Randall fortune that started Rand International was formed from the oppression of the Cities of Heaven, Rand decides to transform the company into a non-profit organization, dedicated to helping the poor. He also sets up the Thunder Dojo in Harlem to help inner-city children, buys back the old Heroes for Hire building as the new Rand International Headquarters and his new home, while offering Luke Cage a position at the company. He also tries to reconnect with Misty Knight. Rand, on his 33rd birthday, learns every single one of the previous Iron Fists died at the age of 33, except Orson Randall, who vanished at that time.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #16</ref>\n\nSoon afterward, Rand is attacked and defeated by Zhou Cheng, a servant of Ch'l-Lin, who claims to have killed the Iron Fists in order to enter K'un-Lun and devour the egg that births the next incarnation of Shou-Lao the Undying every generation, thus wiping out K'un-Lun's Iron Fist legacy. Luke, Misty, and Colleen arrive and save Rand. Rand has his shoulder dislocated during a second battle with Cheng, but manages to defeat Cheng even in his weakened state. Following the duel, the Immortal Weapons, Luke, Colleen, and Misty arrive, and reveal to Rand that they have discovered a map in Cheng's apartment that leads to the Eighth City of Heaven. Rand and the others realize that this is where Ch'l-Lin originated, and depart for the Eighth City.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #20</ref>\n\nIn the Eighth City, he meets Quan Yaozu, the first Iron Fist, who became disillusioned with K'un-Lun and rose up to rule the Eighth City as Changming. Rand and Fat Cobra manage to defeat Quan.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #25</ref> Rand's actions during their battles impress Quan, who decides that Rand may be living proof that K'un-Lun is not the corrupt city it once was. Rand and Davos agree to guide Quan to K'un-Lun and arrange a meeting between him and Lei-Kung to give Quan a forum for his grievances.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #26</ref>\n\nHowever, when Rand returns to New York, he finds a HYDRA cell waiting for him at Rand International, seeking retribution for the death of Xao, and holding Misty hostage. In the ensuing battle, Rand International is destroyed, but Rand and Misty escape unharmed. Now left with only a fraction of his former net worth, Rand and Misty purchase a new condo in Harlem, and Rand decides to focus all of his attention and remaining resources at the Thunder Dojo. While moving into their new home, Rand asks Misty to marry him. Initially skeptical of the offer, Misty accepts and reveals that she is pregnant with Rand's child.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #27</ref>\n\n===Avengers reform===\nIn the aftermath of ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'', Rand joins the newly-reformed New Avengers.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #1</ref> After finding out that Misty's pregnancy was false, Misty and Danny decide to move out of their apartment and live separately, but continue their relationship.<ref>''I Am an Avenger'' #1</ref>\n\nDanny later has an encounter with someone who is going by the name of Power Man.

However, Danny is placed under mind control which creates a mystical interference with the ability of the Immortal Weapons to close the gate. He is then forced to battle his allies. Thanks to War Machine knocking him out, the mission is completed successfully.

Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nPlunging his fists into the molten heart of the dragon Shou-Lao the Undying infused the dragon's superhuman energy into Rand. This, along with being trained by Lei Kung the Thunderer, gave Rand the power of the Iron Fist, allowing him to summon and focus his ''[[Qi|chi]]'' energy (also called natural energy or life force energy) to enhance his natural abilities to extraordinary levels. His strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, reflexes and senses can all be greatly intensified, almost comparable to superhuman levels.\n\nHe is able to concentrate his own ''chi'' and the superhuman energy from Shou-Lao's heart into his hand, with it manifesting as a supernatural glow around his hand and fist.

After she was exposed, Fan Fei was chained up and forced to watch as her students were fed to Shou-Lou by Lei Kung. When she broke out, in the hopes that she will die fighting Shou-Lou, Fan Fei punched the dragon in his chest tattoo and gained his powers. Lei Kung had Fan Fei exiled from K'un-Lun, believing Shou-Lou was dead, and she traveled the world; fighting Deviants and the Gorgilla Clan of Man-Apes along the way. Fan Fei was approached by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who wanted her to use her powers to conquer Earth, but she declined. In response, Mephisto granted his gifts to the Gorgilla Clan. After a fight with Fan Fei, Mephisto led the Gorgilla Clan's Ape King to the Power Infinity Gem, which he used to fight Fan Fei again. After recuperating, Fan Fei found herself at the entrance of K'un-Lun. Lei Kung states that her sentencing was wrong, as they learned Shou-Lou was immortal, and wanted to bring her home. However, she declined, stating that Earth was her home and her fights here are just the beginning.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #13.

He reappears in the ''Ultimate Knights'' arc, as a member of a Daredevil-led team trying to take down the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #107, however, he has apparently betrayed the group to the Kingpin. Daredevil has uncovered the deception and ends issue #109 demanding answers from Rand. In issue #110 Iron Fist reveals that he has a daughter and the Kingpin threatened her life, so he chose his daughter's life over Daredevil's, and the rest of the heroes that teamed up to take down the Kingpin. He did distract Kingpin while Daredevil grabbed Kingpin's wife.

In this reality, he unwillingly serves the long-reigning Emperor [[Fu Manchu (comics)|Zheng Zu]], the master of the ruthless [[Mandarin (character)|Ten Rings]] school, the enemies of the more benevolent Iron Fist school. Rand-K'ai hunts after [[Shang-Chi]], the exiled son of Zu, for the murder of his master Lord Tuan although he suspects the emperor to be involved. Representing the Iron Fist, Rand-K'ai enters the tournament to decide the new ruler of K'un-L'un and eventually confronts Shang-Chi along with [[Elektra (character)|Red Sai]], master of the [[The Hand (comics)|Red Hand]] and the emperor's assassin, in the penultimate round of the Thirteen Chambers. During the fight, Shang-Chi is poisoned by Red Sai, who confesses that Zu had sent her to assassinate Tuan but ultimately failed. To spare his lover and her students from the emperor's wrath, Shang-Chi killed Tuan; Zu implicated and exiled his son for the murder to cover his own involvement. After the truth is revealed, Rand-K'ai uses his Chi to burn the poison in Shang-Chi's body and lets him pass so that he could defeat his father. After Shang-Chi emerges victorious, Rand-K'ai pledges himself to the new emperor.<ref>''Master of Kung Fu'' (vol. 2) #1\u20134</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIron Fist is ranked as the 195th-greatest comic book character of all time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://herochat.com/forum/index.php?topic=170859.0 |title=Wizard's top 200 characters.
