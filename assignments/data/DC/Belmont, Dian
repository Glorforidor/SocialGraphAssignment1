The first of several DC characters to bear the name [[Sandman (DC Comics)|Sandman]], he was created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Allen Bert Christman|Bert Christman]].\n\nAttired in a green business suit, [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]], and [[WWI gas mask|gas mask]], the Sandman used a gun emitting a sleeping gas to sedate criminals. He was originally one of the mystery men to appear in comic books and other types of adventure fiction in the 1930s but later was outfitted with a unitard/cowl costume and developed into a proper superhero, acquiring [[sidekick]] [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandy]], and founding the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nLike most DC Golden Age superheroes, the Sandman fell into obscurity in the 1940s and eventually other DC characters took his name. During the 1990s, when writer [[Neil Gaiman]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]&#39;&#39; (featuring Morpheus, the [[Dream (DC Comics)|anthropomorphic embodiment of dreams]]) was popular, DC revived Dodds in &#39;&#39;[[Sandman Mystery Theatre]]&#39;&#39;, a pulp/noir series set in the 1930s. &#39;&#39;[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine]]&#39;&#39; ranked Wesley Dodds among the Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time, and he is the oldest superhero in terms of continuity to appear on the list.&lt;ref&gt;Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time, Wizard Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Publication history==&lt;!--fictional character biography section needs splitting of from this section--&gt;\n\n===Golden Age of comic books===\nArtist [[Allen Bert Christman|Bert Christman]] and writer [[Gardner Fox]] are generally credited as co-creating the original, Wesley Dodds version of the [[DC Comics]] character the Sandman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |pages=123-124 |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/123 |accessdate=15 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the character&#39;s [[first appearance]] is usually given as &#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39; #40 ([[cover-date]]d July 1939), he also appeared in DC Comics&#39; 1939 &#39;&#39;[[1939 New York World&#39;s Fair|New York World&#39;s Fair]] Comics&#39;&#39; omnibus, which historians believe appeared on newsstands one to two weeks earlier, while also believing the &#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; story was written and drawn first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/sandman1.htm The Sandman] at [[Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia]]: \&quot;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #40 wasn&#39;t quite the character&#39;s first appearance, though. The 1939 issue of &#39;&#39;New York World&#39;s Fair Comics&#39;&#39;, an extra-big anthology DC put out to capitalize on the eponymous event, contained a Sandman story, and probably hit the stands a week or two before his first &#39;&#39;Adventure&#39;&#39; story (though the one in &#39;&#39;Adventure&#39;&#39; is believed to have been written and drawn earlier).\&quot; [https://archive.today/20120524104907/http://www.toonopedia.com/sandman1.htm Archived] from the original December 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gcd-wf&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/594/ &#39;&#39;New York World&#39;s Fair&#39;&#39; #1 (1939), DC, Detective Comics, Inc. imprint] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]: \&quot;First Sandman story to appear in print (before &#39;&#39;Adventure&#39;&#39; #40).\&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Sites including [http://users.cvalley.net/canote/sandman.html JSA Member Profiles: The Sandman] and [http://my.execpc.com/~icicle/SANDMAN.html Members of the Justice Society: The Sandman] concur.--&gt; Each of the two stories&#39; scripts were credited to the pseudonym \&quot;Larry Dean\&quot;; Fox wrote the untitled, 10-page story in &#39;&#39;New York World&#39;s Fair&#39;&#39; #1,&lt;ref name=gcd-wf /&gt; while he simply plotted, and Christman scripted, the untitled, six-page story, generally known as \&quot;The Tarantula Strikes\&quot;, in &#39;&#39;Adventure&#39;&#39; #40.&lt;ref name=gcd-adventure40&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/475/#9280 &#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #40] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creig Flessel]], who drew many early Sandman adventures, has sometimes been credited as co-creator on the basis of drawing the Sandman cover of &#39;&#39;Adventure&#39;&#39; #40,&lt;ref name=gcd-adventure40 /&gt; but no other evidence has surfaced.\n\nFollowing these two [[first appearance]]s, the feature \&quot;The Sandman\&quot; continued to appear in the omnibus &#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; through #102 (Feb.\u2013March 1946). One of the [[mass media|medium]]&#39;s seminal \&quot;mystery men\&quot;, as referred to at the time, the Sandman straddled the [[pulp magazine]] detective tradition and the emerging [[superhero]] tradition by dint of his dual identity and his fanciful, masked attire and weapon: an exotic \&quot;gas gun\&quot; that could compel [[villain]]s to tell the truth, as well as put them to sleep. Unlike many superheroes, he frequently found himself the victim of gunshot wounds, both in the Golden Age and in stories in DC&#39;s modern-day [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint, and he would continue fighting in spite of his injuries.\n\nIn his early career, Dodds (the character&#39;s surname was given as \&quot;Dodd\&quot; in his first four appearances; he became \&quot;Dodds\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #44) was frequently aided by his girlfriend, [[Dian Belmont]], who is aware of his dual identity. Unlike many superhero love interests, Belmont was often, though not always,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Gardner F.

Later stories would reveal that the two remained together for the duration of their lives, though they never married.\n\nThe Sandman was one of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] when that superhero team was introduced in &#39;&#39;[[All Star Comics]]&#39;&#39; #3, published by [[All-American Comics]], one of the companies that would merge to form DC.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #69 (December 1941), Dodds was given a yellow-and-purple costume by writer [[Mort Weisinger]] and artist [[Paul Norris]], as well as a yellow-clad kid sidekick, [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandy the Golden Boy]], nephew of Dian Belmont. Later that year, the celebrated team of [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]] took over this version of the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 41 |quote = Hot properties Joe Simon and Jack Kirby joined DC...taking over the Sandman and Sandy, the Golden Boy feature in &#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #72.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, Dodds enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and served as an anti-aircraft gunner during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;All Star Comics&#39;&#39; #11 (June\u2013July 1942)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Silver Age to Modern Age===\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}}\nReintroduced in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League of America]]&#39;&#39; #46 (July 1966), the Sandman made occasional appearances in the annual teamups between that superhero group and the JSA.\n\nIn 1981 DC began publishing &#39;&#39;All-Star Squadron&#39;&#39;, a retelling of the Earth-Two mystery-men during WWII. Although not a main character, Sandman does appear in its pages. Of note is issue #18 which gives an explanation of why Dodds changed costumes from the cloak and gas mask to the yellow-and-purple outfit; Dian wore his costume while he was fighting elsewhere and she was killed in a fray. Dodds decided to wear the new costume, of Dian&#39;s design, until he could bring himself to wear the original in which she had died.\n\nLater, this explanation would be changed again when Dian Belmont was [[retconned]] to have never died, and a new explanation was given: Sandy convinced Dodds to switch to the more colorful costume to gain the support of regular people, who preferred the more traditional superhero look to his older, [[pulp magazine|pulp]]-themed costume.\n\nAn acclaimed [[film noir]]-inspired retelling of the original Sandman&#39;s adventures, &#39;&#39;[[Sandman Mystery Theatre]]&#39;&#39;, ran from 1993\u20131998 under [[DC Comics]]&#39; &#39;&#39;[[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]]&#39;&#39; mature-reader imprint. Although as a whole its continuity within the [[DC Universe]] is debatable, several elements of the series \u2013 the more nuanced relationship between Dodds and Dian Belmont; the Sandman&#39;s appearance, (wearing a trench coat and World War I gas mask instead of the cape and the custom-made gas mask); and Dodds&#39; pudgier appearance and wearing of glasses \u2013 have been adopted into regular continuity. The series ran for 70 issues and 1 annual.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Sandman Midnight Theatre]]&#39;&#39; (1995) a one-shot special by [[Neil Gaiman]] (author of the Modern Age [[supernatural]] series &#39;&#39;[[Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]&#39;&#39;), [[Matt Wagner]] (co-author of &#39;&#39;[[Sandman Mystery Theatre]]&#39;&#39;), and [[Teddy Kristiansen]], depicts an interaction between the two characters, with the original visiting Great Britain and encountering the imprisoned [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]], the protagonist of Gaiman&#39;s series. A minor [[retcon]] by Gaiman suggested that Dodds&#39; chosen identity was a result of Dream&#39;s absence from the realm the [[Dreaming (comics)|Dreaming]], and that Dodds carries an aspect of that mystical realm. This explains Dodds&#39; prophetic dreams.\n\n===Twilight years===\nDodds is one of a number of Justice Society members who finds themselves in the \&quot;[[Ragnarok]] Dimension\&quot; during the early [[Modern Age of comic books]]. The &#39;&#39;Last Days of the Justice Society of America Special&#39;&#39; (1986) wrote the post-&#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]&#39;&#39; tale of a time-warped wave of destruction ready to engulf the world. Dodds and his JSA teammates enter into a limbo to engage in an eternal battle that would allow the universe to continue its existence.  This was later revealed to be a simulation created by [[Odin]], which he intended to give to [[Dream (comics)|Dream]] as a bribe.  Dodds, Dream&#39;s protege, and [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]], the grandfather of [[Daniel Hall (comics)|Dream&#39;s appointed successor]] are the only JSA members we see at this time.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #26. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; This lasted only until 1992 when DC published &#39;&#39;Armageddon: Inferno&#39;&#39;. This mini-series ended with the JSA members leaving limbo and entering the &#39;real&#39; world. &#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; (1992\u20131993) showed how the JSA members handled returning to normal life. For the Sandman, the series depicted him as an old, thin man with a balding scalp and a sharp wit. Starting with issue #1 his physical condition became important as writer Len Strazewski had him suffer a stroke at the first sign of a villainous attack. Both his age and his physical limitations became a theme writers would use in this character&#39;s post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; stories.\n\nDuring &#39;&#39;[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]&#39;&#39;, Dodds is returned to his proper age by the [[Hank Hall|Extant]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time&#39;&#39; #2. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Wesley Dodds is shown as retired and living with Dian Belmont though occasionally coming out of it, most notably in a team-up with [[Starman (Jack Knight)|Jack Knight]], the son of Dodds&#39; JSA teammate [[Starman (Ted Knight)|Starman]]. When Dian is diagnosed with a terminal disease, the two travel the world together until her death.\n\nTowards the end of his life, Dodds&#39; prophetic dreams alert him to the identity and location of the new [[Hector Hall|Doctor Fate]], prompting him to contact the [[Gray Man]], a being created from the residue of others&#39; dreams, as well as his old friend Speed Saunders to instruct them to warn his former teammates about what he has discovered. Waiting on a clifftop, he is subsequently confronted by the powerful villain [[Mordru]], who intends to force Dodds to tell him the identity of the new Doctor Fate, only for Dodds to distract Mordru with his gas-gun long enough to commit suicide by jumping off the cliff rather than allow Mordru to torture him into submission. His last thoughts were that his final slumber would be free of nightmares as he is reunited with Dian. His youthful but now grown-up sidekick, Sandy the Golden Boy, becomes known simply as &#39;&#39;&#39;Sand&#39;&#39;&#39; and takes his mentor&#39;s place as a member of the Justice Society of America as well as his prophetic dreams. Eventually, he takes the name of &#39;&#39;&#39;Sandman&#39;&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;JSA Secret Files &amp; Origins&#39;&#39; #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====&#39;&#39;Sleep of Reason&#39;&#39;====\nWesley Dodds makes a comeback via flashback images in the 2006 limited series &#39;&#39;[[Sandman Mystery Theatre]]: Sleep of Reason&#39;&#39;.\n\n====Blackest Night====\nDodds is reanimated as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] in the \&quot;[[Blackest Night]]\&quot; storyline. He and several other fallen JSAers attack the Brownstone, seeking the hearts of the living within.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blackest Night&#39;&#39; #4. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Exodus Noir====\nDodds appeared in the \&quot;Exodus Noir\&quot; arc of &#39;&#39;[[Madame Xanadu]]&#39;&#39; in 2010, in a story set in 1940.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the \&quot;[[Watchmen]]\&quot; sequel \&quot;[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]],\&quot; Lois Lane finds a flash-drive at the Daily Planet. It shows her footage of Sandman and the rest of the Justice Society.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Doomsday Clock&#39;&#39; #8 (December 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the pages of \&quot;[[Dark Nights: Death Metal]],\&quot; the Prime-Earth version of Sandman was revealed be entombed at the Valhalla Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Dark Nights: Death Metal&#39;&#39; #2. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDodds has [[Precognition|prophetic dreams]] which come to him as cryptic, ambiguous visions of crimes.  Originally of unexplained origin, these dreams were later ascribed to an encounter between Dodds and the entity known as [[Dream (comics)|Dream]] via [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]. The visions haunt Dodds, who uses his keen intellect and amateur detective skills to properly interpret them. He is also a talented chemist and inventor, creating the sand-like substance and the Silicoid Gun ultimately responsible for transforming Sandy the Golden Boy into a Silicon-based life-form. In the early years of his career, Wesley Dodds possesses the strength level of a man who engages in regular exercise, and was a fine hand-to-hand combatant. As he grows older, his strength level diminishes in relative proportion to his age. As hobbies, Dodds enjoys reading, writing, poetry, [[origami]] and philosophy.  Through an unknown process, Dodds passes his power of prophetic visions on to his former ward, [[Sanderson Hawkins]] upon the moment of his own death.\n \nWesley Dodds&#39; costume consists of a basic green business suit, fedora, a [[World War I]] era gas mask, a gas gun, and a specially designed \&quot;wirepoon\&quot; gun, which fires a length of thin, steel cable. The gas mask protects Dodds from the effects of the gas emitted from his gas gun. The [[gas pistol|gas gun]], a handheld device fitted with cartridges containing concentrated sleeping gas, is Wesley Dodds&#39; only known weapon. Pressing the trigger on the gun releases a cloud of green dust rendering all within the Sandman&#39;s immediate vicinity unconscious. An upgraded canister dispenser for the gun is provided for him by his close friend and confidante, [[Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis)|Lee Travis]]. Dodds is also known to conceal smaller knockout gas capsules in a hollow heel on his shoe.
