Like the Justice Society, the membership of the Seven Soldiers is drawn from DC&#39;s anthology comics:  The [[Greg Saunders|Vigilante]] (from &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39;); the [[Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis)|Crimson Avenger]] (from &#39;&#39;[[Detective Comics]]&#39;&#39;); the [[Green Arrow]] and [[Roy Harper (character)|Speedy]] (from &#39;&#39;[[More Fun Comics]]&#39;&#39;); the [[Shining Knight (Sir Justin)|Shining Knight]] (from &#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39;); and the [[Sylvester Pemberton|Star-Spangled Kid]] and [[Pat Dugan|Stripesy]] (from &#39;&#39;[[Star-Spangled Comics]]&#39;&#39;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/168 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  \n\nUnlike most superhero teams, this one includes two sidekicks, Speedy and Stripesy, as members (Stripesy is a rarity, an adult sidekick to a \&quot;kid\&quot; lead character).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crimson Avenger&#39;s sidekick [[Wing (DC Comics)|Wing]] also takes part in the team&#39;s adventures, and is in every other way an \&quot;eighth Soldier,\&quot; but is never considered an \&quot;official\&quot; member. All but one of its members (the Shining Knight, a time-displaced [[Arthurian]] knight who rides a winged horse and uses an enchanted sword and suit of armor) are non-powered humans who rely on conventional weapons or training in place of superhuman abilities.\n\nPer &#39;&#39;Leading Comics&#39;&#39; #1, the team&#39;s origin comes about when the criminal mastermind called the Hand (later the Iron Hand), believing himself terminally ill, gives his greatest unused schemes to five other criminals who he saved from the police (Big Caesar, the Dummy, the Needle, Professor Merlin, and the Red Dragon) to commit crimes across the USA as \&quot;the Hand&#39;s Five Fingers\&quot; and prove his genius to the world. The Hand also challenges the five criminals&#39; enemies (the Crimson Avenger, the Vigilante, the Star-Spangled Kid and Stripesy, Green Arrow and Speedy, and the Shining Knight, respectively) to stop the criminals, presuming they will fail. However, the heroes defeat the Hand&#39;s Five Fingers. The heroes converge on the Hand&#39;s base after he reveals his whereabouts; the villain had found out a cure for his condition and decides to eliminate the heroes so he can remain free, but the heroes evade his traps. When the villain tries to use a lightning ray machine against them, the Vigilante shoots a crucial component of the device, bringing machinery down upon the Hand and apparently killing him. Deciding they work well together, the heroes form the Seven Soldiers of Victory.\n\nThe Seven Soldiers of Victory appear in the first fourteen issues of &#39;&#39;Leading Comics&#39;&#39; (which changed to an all-humor format in #15). Notable enemies include the [[Black Star (character)|Black Star]], who uses \&quot;black light\&quot; to transform himself into a giant;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Leading Comics&#39;&#39; #2&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Wilfred Doome, who uses a time machine to summon historic tyrants as his operatives;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Leading Comics&#39;&#39; #3&lt;/ref&gt; the Sense-Master, who attempts to assemble a \&quot;lifestone\&quot; to animate an army of stone; the Skull, who pays criminals to steal an experimental age-reversing device; the Copperhead (not to be confused with [[Batman]]&#39;s enemy [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]]), who briefly turns the Soldiers against each other during an Andes treasure  hunt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Leading Comics&#39;&#39; #6&lt;/ref&gt; the democracy-suppressing Wizards of Stanovia;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Leading Comics&#39;&#39; #7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dummy (DC Comics)|the Dummy]], who, in a reversal of Doome&#39;s tactics, uses a time machine to send the Soldiers into the past;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Leading Comics&#39;&#39; #8&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. X, who wagers with several of the heroes&#39; individual enemies that he can defeat the entire team;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Leading Comics&#39;&#39; #9&lt;/ref&gt; gangster Baby-Face Johnson;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Leading Comics&#39;&#39; #10&lt;/ref&gt; and the Barracuda, who seeks powerful artifacts used by earlier criminals.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Leading Comics&#39;&#39; #13&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA script by [[Joseph Samachson]] from the 1940s, in which the elflike Willie Wisher banishes the Soldiers to \&quot;the Land of Magic,\&quot; where they encounter various supernatural characters, was later serialized in 1975 in &#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39; #438\u2013443, with each chapter illustrated by a different artist (including [[Dick Dillin]], [[Howard Chaykin]], [[Lee Elias]], [[Mike Grell]], [[Ernie Chan]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 162|quote = An unpublished Seven Soldiers of Victory story finally saw print as a backup feature in &#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #438 \u2013 three decades after it was written.

Having been unable to destroy the hand themselves, the only clue the JSA could find was a mystical vision of a grave for \&quot;the Unknown Soldier of Victory\&quot;. An unearthly [[Aurakles|Oracle]], summoned up by [[Doctor Fate]], [[Zatanna]], and the Thunderbolt of [[Johnny Thunder]], reveals to the JLA and the JSA that the Seven Soldiers had fought and destroyed a similar menace called the [[Nebula Man]] many years previously, though at the seeming cost of their existences. The Oracle then explains that the Soldiers had instead been scattered throughout history. The two teams split into smaller groups and are sent back in time by the Oracle to find them.  \n\n[[Doctor Fate]], the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] and the [[Elongated Man]] find the Crimson Avenger in Mexico, where he believes he is the Aztec Sun God. [[Superman]], [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|The Sandman]] and [[Metamorpho]] rescue the amnesic Shining Knight from the hordes of [[Genghis Khan]]. [[Hawkman]], [[Doctor Mid-Nite]], and the Golden Age [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman]] find the Golden Age Green Arrow in medieval England, where he had been mistaken for [[Robin Hood]]. [[Batman]], [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Hourman]] and [[Starman (DC Comics Golden Age)|Starman]] retrieve Stripesy from ancient Egypt. The Silver Age [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]] and [[Johnny Thunder]] and [[Thunderbolt (DC Comics)|Thunderbolt]] save the Vigilante from a tribe of Indians in the Old West. [[Aquaman]], [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Wildcat]] and the Silver Age [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] rescue the Star-Spangled Kid from 50,000 years in the past. [[Zatanna]], the Silver Age [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and the [[Red Tornado]] free Speedy from ancient Greece, where he had been transformed into a centaur by [[Circe (character)|Circe]]. The Golden Age [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]], [[Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane)|Mister Terrific]] and the Golden Age [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Robin]] go on a quest to discover the identity of the Unknown Soldier of Victory, whose tomb lay in the mountains of Tibet, where the Seven Soldiers had fallen after defeating the Nebula Man.\n\nThe Seven Soldiers are reunited but the Earth-1 [[Diana Prince]] had been attacked by the Iron Hand. She is able to overcome him, but he is no longer able to stop the giant hand. The heroes create a new Nebula Rod to deal with the giant hand. Unfortunately, whoever uses the Nebula Rod is certain to perish (as did the Crimson Avenger&#39;s partner Wing, revealed to be the Unknown Soldier of Victory, when the Nebula Man was stopped). While the heroes argue over who will make the sacrifice, the android Red Tornado takes the Nebula Rod and destroys the Hand, destroying himself in the process.\n\nThe only other modern meeting of the team (either in pre- or post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] continuity) takes place in &#39;&#39;[[Infinity, Inc.]]&#39;&#39; #11, in which the Vigilante, the Shining Knight, Green Arrow, Speedy and the Star-Spangled Kid gather at the grave of Lee Travis, the man known as the Crimson Avenger.  He had died two years&#39; earlier saving Gotham City from a boatload of explosives in &#39;&#39;[[DC Comics Presents]]&#39;&#39; #38.\n\n===Post-Crisis===\n====First team====\nIn the original Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] [[retcon]] of the team, both Wing and the Vigilante&#39;s sidekick Stuff, the Chinatown Kid are promoted to full membership, to replace the Golden Age Green Arrow and Speedy, who had been removed from active continuity.  Stuff had never appeared with the team during the original &#39;&#39;Leading Comics&#39;&#39; run, while an older man named [[Billy Gunn (comics)|Billy Gunn]] helped out the Vigilante on his cases in the comic.\n\nThis [[retcon]] is changed in the late nineties, in &#39;&#39;[[Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.]]&#39;&#39; #9.  While Stuff remains a full member, Wing is not an official Soldier because his mentor the Crimson Avenger wants him to do something more important with his life.  The remaining spot on the team is filled by the [[Spider (DC Comics)|Spider]], an archer who had originally appeared in Quality Comics&#39; &#39;&#39;[[Crack Comics]]&#39;&#39;.  This Spider is really a villain, and has been working with the team&#39;s arch-enemy the Hand, creator of the original Nebula Man.  The Spider sabotages the Nebula Rod, and sends the team to fight a fruitless battle.  The villain tries to kill Wing, but he escapes and reaches the other Soldiers.  They repair the Nebula Rod and use it to destroy the Nebula Man.  Wing dies, and his teammates are again tossed through time and later retrieved by the JLA and JSA. The only major difference between this story and the 1972 story is that this time the Vigilante is found after he had spent nearly 20 years fighting crime in the Old West.\n\nIn 2010&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[DC Universe: Legacies]]&#39;&#39; #2, [[TNT (comics)|TNT]] and [[Dan the Dyna-Mite|Dyna-Mite]] are retconned into the team&#39;s original line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/06/15/continue-to-explore-the-history-of-the-dcu-with-legacies-2/ |title=DC Universe: The Source \&quot; Blog Archive \&quot; Continue to explore the history of the DCU with LEGACIES #2 |publisher=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbloc.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1617133 |title=Newest Seven Soldiers in DC Legacies #2 (Spoilers) \u2013 The Comic Bloc Forums |publisher=Comicbloc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718120413/http://www.comicbloc.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1617133 |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.majorspoilers.com/archives/42515.htm/ |title=Dueling Review: DC Universe: Legacies #2 &amp;#124; Major Spoilers \u2013 Comic Book Reviews and News |publisher=Major Spoilers |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2011-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625003119/http://www.majorspoilers.com/archives/42515.htm/ |archivedate=2010-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has not yet been revealed precisely how this retcon affects the respective histories of the Spider, TNT or Dyna-Mite.\n\nThe Seven Soldiers have not reformed in the Modern Age (partly due to Grant Morrison&#39;s project; see below). Three of the originals--[[Shining Knight]], [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] and [[Stripesy]] (now STRIPE)--remain. The team has inspired a few legacies. The first is [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]], who at first carries the mantle of Star-Spangled Kid in memory of Sylvester Pemberton. She is now a double legacy, as she also carries on the legacy of [[Starman (comics)|Starman]]. The second legacy is the new [[Crimson Avenger]], who has appeared sporadically in the series &#39;&#39;[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]&#39;&#39;. She has yet to make an appearance [[One Year Later]], though she is seen towards the end of [[Infinite Crisis]]. The third one is Gardner Grayle, the [[Atomic Knight]] (see below). The last one is the new Sir Justin in Grant Morrison&#39;s project.\n\n====Second team====\nAnother group takes the name of the Seven Soldiers of Victory in the &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; issue of the limited series known as &#39;&#39;[[Silver Age (DC Comics Title)|Silver Age]]&#39;&#39;.
