Produced by Barney A. Sarecky and directed by [[Lee Sholem]], it stars [[George Reeves]] as [[Superman]] and [[Phyllis Coates]] as [[Lois Lane]]. It is the first [[feature film]] based on any [[DC Comics]] character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schelly |first1=William |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1950s |date=2013 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781605490540 |pages=51\u201352}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe film&#39;s storyline concerns reporters Clark Kent and Lois Lane arriving in the small town of Silsby to witness the drilling of the world&#39;s deepest oil well. The drill, however, has penetrated the underground home of a race of small, bald humanoids who, out of curiosity, climb to the surface at night. They glow in the dark, which scares the local townfolk, who form a mob intent on killing the strange visitors. Only Superman can intervene to prevent a tragedy.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane]] arrive in the small town of Silsby to report on the world&#39;s deepest oil well. That night two small, furry, bald-headed [[humanoid]]s come up through the shaft and scare the elderly night watchman to death. Lois and Clark arrive at the oil well and find the dead watchman. Clark and the foreman explore the surrounding area for signs of foul play when Lois glimpses one of the creatures and screams. No one believes her when she tells them what she saw.\n\nThe medical examiner is summoned, and he later leaves with Lois. Clark stays behind to confront the foreman, who confesses that the well was closed for fear that they had struck [[radium]] and not oil. The foreman proceeds to show Clark ore samples that were collected during different stages of drilling; all of them glow brightly.\n\nMeanwhile the two Mole Men innocently explore the town. The residents become terrified because of their peculiar appearance and because everything that they touch glows in the dark (due to simple [[phosphorescence]]). Soon an angry mob forms, led by the violent Luke Benson, in order to kill the \&quot;monsters\&quot;. Superman stops Benson and the mob and saves one of the creatures after it has been shot. He takes it to the hospital. The second creature returns to the well head and disappears down its shaft.\n\nA doctor announces that the injured creature will die unless he has surgery to remove the bullet. When a nurse refuses to do so out of fear, Clark volunteers to assist. Benson&#39;s mob arrives at the hospital demanding that the creature be turned over to them. Superman stands guard outside the hospital. Lois stands at his side, but a shot is fired from the mob, narrowly missing her. Superman sends her inside and relieves the mob of their rifles and pistols.\n\nThree more Mole Men emerge from the drill shaft, this time bearing a strange weapon. They make their way to the hospital. Benson and his mob see the creatures, and Benson goes after them alone. The creatures fire their laser-like weapon at him. Superman jumps in front of the pulsating ray, saving Benson&#39;s life, which Superman says \&quot;is more than you deserve!\&quot;. Superman fetches the wounded creature from the hospital and carries him as his companions return to the well head. Soon after, from deep underground, the Mole Men destroy the drill shaft, making certain that no one can come up or go down it ever again. Lois observes, \&quot;It&#39;s almost as if they were saying, &#39;You live your lives ... and we&#39;ll live ours&#39;\&quot;.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[George Reeves]] as [[Superman|Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman]]\n*[[Phyllis Coates]] as [[Lois Lane]]\n*[[Jeff Corey]] as Luke Benson\n*[[Walter Reed (actor)|Walter Reed]] as Bill Corrigan\n*[[J.

Both have been considered retrospectively as the product of (and a reaction to) the [[Red Scare#Second Red Scare .281947.E2.80.9357.29|\&quot;Red Scare\&quot;]] of post-[[World War II]] era. Grossman also cites the later film &#39;&#39;[[The Mole People]]&#39;&#39; (1956).\n\n==Production==\n[[File:1951Superman002.jpg|thumb|&#39;&#39;Superman and the Mole Men&#39;&#39; was the first theatrical [[feature film]] based on any [[DC Comics]] character.]]&#39;&#39;Superman and the Mole Men&#39;&#39; is the first theatrical [[feature film]] based on any [[DC Comics]] character. Previously, two live-action, multiple chapter [[movie serials]] were made by [[Columbia Pictures]] Inc., based on the Superman comics feature and radio program, featuring [[Kirk Alyn]] as Superman and [[Noel Neill]] as [[Lois Lane]], had been shown in weekly installments in movie theaters. Two additional serials based on DC&#39;s [[Batman]], the first featuring [[Lewis Wilson]] as Batman and [[Douglas Croft]] as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]/[[Dick Grayson]], and the second featuring [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]] as Batman and [[Johnny Duncan (actor)|Johnny Duncan]] as Robin/Dick Grayson, were also made by Columbia (1943 and 1949).\n\nThe original screenplay was by \&quot;Richard Fielding\&quot;, a pseudonym for [[Robert Maxwell (producer)|Robert Maxwell]] and [[Whitney Ellsworth]].\n\n&#39;&#39;Superman and the Mole Men&#39;&#39; was filmed in a little more than 12 days starting on July 10, 1951&lt;ref&gt;Ames, Walter. Los Angeles Times. July 6, 1951. &lt;/ref&gt; at RKO-Pathe Studios.  The feature runs just 58 minutes and originally served as a [[trial balloon]] release for the syndicated &#39;&#39;[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]&#39;&#39; [[TV series]], for which it became the only two-part episode, \&quot;The Unknown People\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grossman |first1=Gary |title=Superman: Serial to Cereal |date=1976 |publisher=Popular Library |pages=59\u201361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some elements of the original film were trimmed when converted for television, including some portions of a lengthy chase scene and all references to \&quot;Mole Men\&quot;. \n\nThe theme music used for the film had a generic \&quot;science fiction sound\&quot;, with nothing suggesting a specific Superman theme. The [[title cards]] were similarly generic, with low-grade animation of comets sailing by [[Saturn]]-like ringed planets. The original [[film score]] by [[Darrell Calker]] was removed when &#39;&#39;Superman and the Mole Men&#39;&#39; was re-cut into the two-part Superman TV episode and replaced with the \&quot;canned\&quot; production library music used in the first season of the series.\n\nThe laser-like weapon of the Mole Men, which they retrieve from their subterranean home in order to defend themselves and rescue their injured comrade, was a prop made by adding metal shoulder braces to one end of an [[Electrolux]] [[vacuum cleaner]] body; for the ray&#39;s \&quot;gun barrel\&quot; a standard metal funnel was attached to the other.\n\nThe image of actors Reeves and Coates on the theatrical release poster is a painting derived by reversing (\&quot;flopping\&quot;) a publicity photograph image of the two actors, with Superman&#39;s \&quot;S shield\&quot; emblem then reversed in order for it to read correctly.\n\n==Home media==\n&#39;&#39;Superman and the Mole Men&#39;&#39; was first released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] by [[Warner Home Video]] on July 22, 1988, coinciding with the 50th anniversary celebrations of the [[Superman]] character that year. Both the two-part TV episode and the full feature are on the 2005 first season [[DVD]] release for &#39;&#39;Adventures of Superman&#39;&#39;. During 2006, the film was released as a bonus feature on the DVD 4-Disc Special Edition of &#39;&#39;[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]&#39;&#39;. &#39;&#39;Superman and the Mole Men&#39;&#39; received a [[Blu-ray]] box set release in 2011. In 2017 Cheezy Movies released it on [[DVD]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* [[Bill Warren (film historian and critic)|Warren, Bill]]. &#39;&#39;Keep Watching the Skies: American Science Fiction Films of the Fifties&#39;&#39;, 21st Century Edition.
