They are described as an offshoot of the evolutionary process that created sentient life on [[Earth]]. The original instigators of this process, the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], intended the Eternals to be the defenders of Earth, which leads to the inevitability of war against their destructive counterparts, the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]. The Eternals were created by [[Jack Kirby]], and made their first appearance in ''The Eternals'' #1 (July 1976).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=125}}</ref>\n\nThe Eternals will debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] with their own feature film, ''[[Eternals (film)|Eternals]]'', on February 12, 2021.\n\n==Publication history==\nIn 1970, Jack Kirby left Marvel Comics to work at [[DC Comics]], where he began the saga of the [[New Gods]], an epic story involving mythological and science fiction concepts, and planned to have a definite ending. However, the saga was left incomplete after the cancellation of the titles. Kirby then began working on ''The Eternals'' when he returned to Marvel. The Eternals' saga was thematically similar to the New Gods', and the series was also eventually canceled without resolving many of its plots.<ref name=\"IGNEternals\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/21/marvels-the-eternals-movie-explained-is-the-next-big-mcu-franchise-about-thanos-race|title=Marvel's Eternals Explained|last=Schedeen|first=Jesse|website=[[IGN]]|date=July 21, 2019|accessdate=July 22, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721181616/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/21/marvels-the-eternals-movie-explained-is-the-next-big-mcu-franchise-about-thanos-race|archivedate=July 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"denofgeek\">{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/books/marvel/282226/who-are-eternals-explained-comics-history|title=Who Are Marvel's Eternals: Comic History Explained|last=Buxton|first=Marc|website=[[Den of Geek]]|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=July 22, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719164703/https://www.denofgeek.com/us/books/marvel/282226/who-are-eternals-explained-comics-history|archivedate=July 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"io9\">{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/who-are-the-eternals-the-cosmic-superheroes-who-could-1825503953|title=Who Are the Eternals, the Cosmic Superheroes Who Could Be the Future of the MCU?|last=Whitbrook|first=James|website=[[io9]]|date=September 26, 2018|accessdate=July 22, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127114634/https://www.cbr.com/eternals-movie-secrets-revealed-marvel/|archivedate=November 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Writers [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Mark Gruenwald]] used the Eternals in a ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' storyline that climaxed in ''Thor ''#301,<ref>''Thor Annual'' #7 (1978) and ''Thor'' #291-301 (May 1979 - Nov. 1980)</ref> resolving those lingering plotlines.

These experiments also led to the capacity for super-powered [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutations]] in humans. They also performed this experiment on other planets (such as the [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]] homeworlds) with similar results.\n\nDespite looking human, Eternals are [[Longevity|much longer-lived]] (but were not originally fully [[Immortality|immortal]]) and that kept them from having much contact with their human cousins. Eternals have a low birth rate; they can interbreed with humans but the result is always a normal human (although Joey Athena, son of [[Thena]] and a normal human seems to have become an Eternal with long lived properties and powers).<ref>Eternals Volume 4 Issue 9</ref> Despite this, the Eternals have in general protected the human race, especially from the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]], with whom they've always had an enmity. The Eternals also developed advanced technology.\n\nLong ago, a civil war broke out amongst the Eternals over whether to conquer the other races, with one faction led by [[Kronos (comics)|Kronos]] and the other by his warlike brother, Uranos. Kronos's side prevailed, and Uranos and his defeated faction left Earth and journeyed to Uranus where they built a colony. Some of Uranos's group soon tried to return to Earth to re-kindle the war, but they were attacked by a passing [[Kree]] ship and forced to land on Saturn's moon [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]]. There they built another colony. (Experiments performed by Kree scientists on a captured Eternal led them to go to [[Earth]] and perform their own genetic experiments on a group of humans, thus creating the [[Inhumans]].)\n \nOne day, Kronos's experiments in cosmic energy caused a catastrophic release of energy throughout the Eternals' city, Titanos, destroying it, activating latent genes in the Eternals, and disintegrating the scientist's body. The Eternals now found they could channel large quantities of cosmic energy themselves, granting them near-godlike power. The accident left Kronos in an [[immaterialism|immaterial]] state, so a new leader had to be chosen. For the first time, the Eternals merged into a single being, the Uni-Mind, to decide which of Kronos's sons, [[Zuras]] or [[A'lars]] should be the new leader. Zuras was chosen to be the Prime Eternal, and A'lars chose to leave Earth to avoid causing another civil war, and journeyed to [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]].\n\nThere he found that a war (allegedly caused by the [[Dragon of the Moon]]) had erupted on Titan and wiped out all but one member, a woman named [[Sui-San]]. A'lars fell in love with her, and in time they repopulated Titan. Due to the mix of activated genes from A'lars and unactivated ones from Sui-San, these new Titanian Eternals are not as powerful or immortal as Terran Eternals, but are more powerful and longer-lived than the earlier pre-civil war Titanian Eternals.\n\nWhile Zuras ruled, three new Eternal cities were built. The first was [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]], located in the mountains of Greece, near the main portal between the Earth dimension and the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians']] home dimension, which led many ancient Greeks to confuse some of the godlike Eternals with members of the Olympian pantheon. Eventually, an agreement was reached with the gods where some Eternals, such as [[Thena]], would impersonate the Olympians before their worshipers. The other two Eternal cities were Polaria (located in Siberia) and Oceana (in the Pacific).\n\n18,000 years ago, the Celestials returned to Earth. The Deviants attacked them, but the Celestials counterattacked, resulting in the sinking of [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]] and [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]], and much worldwide havoc. The Eternals helped rescue many humans. An Eternal named [[Valkin]] was entrusted by the Celestials with an artifact of great power for safekeeping.\n\nAt some point during the early centuries, [[Ikaris]] and the Eternals came into conflict with the immortal mutant, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. This conflict ended when Ikaris and the Eternals defeated him. Ikaris believed Apocalypse was dead.\n\n1,000 years ago, the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] encountered some Eternals, but the encounter was erased from his mind, to prevent him from learning about the Celestials, who were about to return to Earth. An Eternal named [[Ajak]] became the Celestials' spokesperson, and put himself to sleep when the Celestials left, to wait for their return 1,000 years later to judge humanity.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, a human scientist made contact with the Uranian Eternals and was taken to live with them along with his young son, who would later become [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]].<ref>''Marvel Boy'' #1 (Dec. 1950)</ref> The Uranians were eventually killed by [[Deathurge]].<ref>''[[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]]'' #2 (November 1989)</ref> After World War II, some Eternals allied with humans and Deviants to form the Damocles Foundation, which tried to create a new breed of superhuman to rule Earth.<ref>''X-Force'' #79 (1998)</ref> Some Eternals, such as [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], were also active as [[superheroes]], or living amongst humans, keeping their true nature hidden. The Eternals also helped to move the Inhumans' city to the Himalayas to keep it hidden.\n\nAt some point, [[Thanos]] of the Eternals of Titan nearly destroyed their colony, but they rebuilt it, and would help Earth's heroes to oppose him on several occasions.\n\n===Modern Age===\n\nIn recent times, Ikaris meet the archaeologist Daniel Damian and his daughter Margo, and accompanied them into a old Eternal city in the Andes, where he awakened Ajax. Ajax began the process to receive the Celestials. These movements alerted the Deviants, who decided to attack New York and to provoke fear in the humans against the coming celestials.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] returned to judge the worthiness of their creations a few years ago, the Eternals found themselves clashing with the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] again, and decided to publicly reveal their existence to humanity.  <ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #5-10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Zuras feared what would happen if the Celestials judged unfavorably. They encountered Thor again, and were attacked by Thor's father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and the Olympian gods, who tried to prevent their interfering with the gods' plans to attack the Celestials. Eventually, the Eternals decided to help the gods and formed a Uni-Mind to assist the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer's]] assault on the Celestials.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 1 #284-301. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThey were forced to dissolve back into Eternals by the Celestials, and the shock of the attack killed Zuras. Before his spirit fully left the material plane, he instructed his daughter Thena to take his people to explore space.  Since then, the Eternals have helped Earth's heroes, particularly the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], against several menaces. They also discovered the existence of the Titanian Eternals.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1 #246-248. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\nSome time later, the Deviant's aristocracy, led by  Brother Tode, attacked Olympia, kidnapping the Eternals and intending to disintegrate them. The hero Iron Man (James Rhodes) rescued the Eternals and helped them defeat the deviants. Then the Eternals transformed the deviant's aristocracy into a synthetic cube, killing them. <ref>''Iron Man Annual'' Vol. 1 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Eternals formed a Unimind to discuss their future on earth, after which most of the Eternals led by Valkin, when to the stars. But a handful&nbsp;\u2013 those most heavily involved in Earthly affairs&nbsp;\u2013 remained behind on Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1 #248. Marvel Comics.</ref> Thena came to lead the remaining Eternals but she wasn't very respected by her subjects.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWith the ascensi\u00f3n of Priestlord Ghaur as leader of the Deviants, the Eternals joined the Avengers in defeating him after he absorbed the power of a Celestial and  tried to gain godhood. Meanwhile Ikaris questioned Thena for her poor choices as leader of the Eternals. She was subtly being controlled by a brain mine put in her by [[Kro]].  After a special ceremony, Ikaris succeded her as leader of the Earth's Eternals. The lover of Ikaris, Margo Damian, was captured by Ghaur's minions and was killed as a result of a deviant experiment on her.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #1-12. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\nAfter the death of his daughter, Daniel Damian decided to take revenge against the Deviants and the Eternals. With help of ancient Eternal machines, he forged a prophecy to incite war between the two races and transformed [[Ajax]] in a murderous monster. When his plan was discovered by the Eternals, Ajax reverted to his original form and regretted the killings that he had committed, so he killed Damian and himself .<ref>''Eternals:Herod Factor'' #1.

Marvel Comics.</ref> When Sersi became sick with the ''Mahd Wy'ry'' disease, a uncurable degenerating Eternal disease , Ikaris and other Eternals tried to bring her to Olympia and perform a rite of Cleansing. Sersi rejected the idea, on the basis that the ritual was designed to kill the infected Eternal, and solicited his family to perform  the ''Gann Josin'' bond between her and her lover the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]. Ikaris was furious and performed the bond without consent of the Knight. <ref>''Avengers''  #361. (1993) Marvel Comics.</ref> Later Thena and other Eternals helped the Avengers in the battle against  the Gatherers and Proctor, who was an alternate Black Knight and was who infect Sersi with the ''Mahd Wy'ry'' disease for spite.<ref>''Avengers''  #374-375.

Most seem to have no memory of their own history and abilities, except Ikaris, and no records of their previous appearances remain. Apparently the Eternal known as [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]], angered at having to remain an eleven-year-old and unable to grow any further, managed to induce collective amnesia in the Eternals as well as distort their perceptions of history. This can possibly be seen as Gaiman's attempt to [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] the characters; early stories as well as [[OHOTMU|officially published statistics]] portrayed most of the current generation of Eternals&nbsp;\u2013 such as Ikaris and Thena&nbsp;\u2013 as being \"only\" several tens of thousands of years old but Gaiman's run describes them as being closer to a million years old.\n\nA group of Deviants manage to kidnap [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], using him to awaken the [[Dreaming Celestial]]. Upon awakening, he decides to judge humanity. The Eternals, realizing that they cannot stop him, leave him be. The Eternals then embark on a quest to go and recruit the other members who have similarly forgotten their true selves due to Sprite's trickery.\n\n===The Final Host===\nWhen Celestials literally began \"raining\" down on Earth, the Avengers are forced to reunite again and just in time to see the arrival of the Final Host which is composed of Dark Celestials that are each physically unique and were the ones who easily took down their brethren.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #1</ref> In an attempt to learn more about these new breed of Celestials, Iron Man and Doctor Strange travelled to the Mountains of Greece in order to try to get some answers from The Eternals. When Stark and Strange arrived, there were no signs of life to be found as almost all of the Eternals were dead, with Strange deducing that the wounds were self-inflicted. Only Ikaris was left barely alive and reveals that the Eternals were never meant to protect Humanity as they thought. Instead, they were actually created to \"cultivate\" them, as the Celestials saw the human population as a useful pathogen to act as antibodies against the Horde. This discovery drove all Eternals mad which either made them turn against each other or commit suicide. Ikaris is also able to reveal that the only way to prevent the Final Host from unleashing the Horde is the Uni-mind and sends a message into Stark's mind before the last Eternal died.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #4</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDue to the cosmic energy that suffuses an Eternal's body and the unbreakable mental hold they have over their physiological processes, the Eternals of Earth are effectively immortal. They live for millennia, do not fatigue from physical exertion, are immune to [[disease]] and [[poison]], and are unaffected by environmental extremes of cold and heat. Most cannot be injured by conventional weaponry, and even if they somehow are, an Eternal can rapidly regenerate any damage as long as they are able to retain their mental hold over their bodies; this mental bond can be broken. In the 2006 series it was also stated that Eternals are able to absorb oxygen directly from water, and therefore cannot drown. In the same series, Ikaris was plunged into molten metal and experienced great pain, but no physical injury, which the Deviants attributed to a forcefield which protects Ikaris even when unconscious. It is unclear if all Eternals share this degree of protection.\n\nAt one time, the official limit to the Eternals' durability was such that they could only be permanently destroyed by dispersing their bodies' molecules over a wide area.<ref>Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Volume #1, Issue 4</ref>\nThis degree of extreme durability was revealed to have increased to a much greater degree; as demonstrated in the 2006 ''Eternals'' limited series,<ref name=\"2006_2\">Eternals (2006) Issue #2</ref> it is shown that even total molecular dispersal is insufficient to destroy an Eternal. As long as \"The Machine\" (a restoration device of Celestial origin; possibly the Earth itself)<ref name=\"2006_6\">Eternals (2006), Issue #6</ref> keeps running, any destroyed Eternal will eventually return, as was the case with Ikaris after he was completely vaporized by a [[particle accelerator]] as part of a series of \"experiments\" performed upon him by the Deviants.\n\nThis same cosmic energy can be channeled for a number of superhuman abilities. All Eternals are potentially capable of:\n\n* Superhuman strength. The limits of their strength can be increased as a result of years of focusing some of their energy towards that purpose.\n* Projecting concussive blasts, heat, and/or blinding flashes of energy from their eyes and hands\n* [[Flight]] (and levitating others)\n* Reading/[[Mind control|controlling minds]]\n* Generating illusions\n* [[Teleportation|Teleporting]] vast distances, though most Eternals prefer not to use this ability as many find it uncomfortable (and according to the 2006 series, it also greatly depletes their store of cosmic energy)\n* Transmuting objects, altering both their shape and composition. (The extent of this ability can vary from one Eternal to another.)\n* Forcefield generation providing invulnerability to harm.\n*In addition, groups of Eternals, as few as three at a time,<ref name=\"2006_6\"/> can initiate a transformation into a gestalt being called the Uni-Mind, a vastly powerful psionic entity that contains the totality of the powers and abilities of all the beings that comprise it.\n\nSome Eternals choose to focus on a particular power in order to increase their effectiveness with it. [[Sersi]], for example, has developed the power of transmutation further than any other Eternal. Additionally, some Eternals choose to focus their cosmic energies into other, non-standard abilities. [[Ikaris]], for example, channels cosmic energy to greatly enhance his senses, while [[Interloper (comics)|the Interloper]] uses his to generate fear in others, and [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] uses his cosmic energies for superspeed.\n\n===Limitations===\nThe recent [[retcon]] of the Eternals' origins and abilities introduces a significant limitation to their powers, and possibly to their free will, with numerous references to Eternals being \"programmed\" or \"hardwired.\" They cannot attack their Celestial \"masters\" for any reason, whether they make a conscious decision to do so, or are tricked into accidentally striking the beings.<ref name=\"2006_4\">Eternals (2006), Issue #4</ref><ref>\"The Incredible Hercules\" (2008) Issue #3</ref> Any such attempt shuts down the body of the attacking Eternal, and is implied to be an automatic defense mechanism of the Celestials' armor.<ref>Eternals (2008), Issue #4</ref> On one occasion, when the Eternals attempted to form a Uni-Mind with the intent of keeping the [[Dreaming Celestial]] asleep, they were immediately shut down and discorporated back into their original, individual forms before they could even form a non-aggressive plan of action.<ref name=\"2006_5\">\"Eternals\" (2006), Issue #5</ref> Eternals can seemingly also not leave the solar system.\n\nFurthermore, Eternals are compelled to attack and neutralize any being that attempts to engage any Celestial with hostile intent<ref name=\"2006_5\"/> &mdash; this compulsion extends even to the Dreaming Celestial, whom the Eternals were forced to defend even as they feared that the newly awakened Celestial would destroy all life on the planet.\n\nAt least as presented in Gaiman's Volume 3, the Eternals are aware of their role on Earth, and the duties and constraints placed on them by the Celestials.  Ikaris rather sardonically describes himself as \"a humanoid-based repair and maintenance unit left behind by unknowable alien gods to make sure that the earth is still here and in good shape when they get back.\"<ref name=\"2006_4\"/> Zuras phrased the same concept more philosophically: \"We are the Eternals. We are the court of last resort for humanity and for all living things on Earth. [...] We do not choose sides. Countries are lines in the sand, empires rise and fall. We are timeless.  We will still be here tomorrow, and a hundred centuries from now.\"<ref name=\"2006_6\"/>\n\n==Members==\n{{main|List of Eternals}}\n\n===Generations===\nThe Eternals are split between five different generationals groups:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/eternals-mcu-surprising-facts/|title=10 Things You Need To Know About The Eternals|last=Sherlock|first=Ben|website=[[Screen Rant]]|date=May 22, 2019|accessdate=August 25, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710203504/https://screenrant.com/eternals-mcu-surprising-facts/|archivedate=July 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* '''First Generation Eternal''' (''those born before the fall of Titanos''): Arlok, Astron, Daina, Kronos/Chronos/Chronus, Master Elo, Oceanus, Shastra, Thyrio, Uranos.\n* '''Second Generation Eternal''' (''those alive at the time of Chronus's experiment''): [[Mentor (A'lars)]], Amaa, Cybele, Forgotten One/Gilgamesh, Helios, Perse, Rakar, Tulayn, Valkin, Virako, Zuras.\n*'''Third Generation Eternal''' (''those born after Chronos's experiment but before the Second Host''): Aginar, Ajak, Arex, Atlo, Domo, Ikaris, Interloper, Mara, Phastos, Sigmar, Thanos, Thena, Veron, Zarin.\n* '''Fourth Generation Eternal''' (''those born after the coming of the Second Host, 20,000 years ago''): Argos, Ceyote, Chi Demon, the Delphan brothers, Druig, Khoryphos, Makkari, Psykos, Sersi, Kingo Sunen, El Vampiro.\n* '''Fifth Generation Eternal''' (''those born after the coming of the Third Host, 3,000 years ago''): Aurelle, Sprite, Titanis.\n\n==Antecedents==\n*[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s book ''[[Childhood's End]]'' from 1953 provided large inspiration, including the idea of \"Overlords\" who control Earth's fate and will reveal themselves further after a 50-year waiting period, the idea of demons being humanity's memory of another species, and the \"Overmind\" concept which seems to influence the comic's \"Uni-mind\".\n*[[Erich von D\u00e4niken]]'s book ''[[Chariots of the Gods?|Chariots of the Gods]]'', a 1968 non-fiction best-seller, postulated the concept of alien gods as real.  Kirby acknowledged in dialogue with fans of the Eternals that he owed some debt to D\u00e4niken's book.\n*The Hurricane and Mercury, two characters of [[Timely Comics]], the 1940s predecessor of Marvel, were [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] as being guises of the Eternal Makkari.\n*Thematically, the Eternals were similar to another Kirby creation, the [[New Gods]] \u2014 another group of ancient godlike beings in an epic struggle with their opposites, with humanity caught in between.\n{{clear}}\n\n==The Eternal==\n\n''The Eternal'' is a series from Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint written by [[Chuck Austen]], based on an idea he had been working on for a while: \"I pitched this back when I first started working at Marvel, but Joe Quesada was against doing it. He saw no future in this particular old Kirby concept.\"<ref name=cbr1944>{{cite web |last=Singh |first=Arune |date=March 21, 2003 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=1944 |title=MAX Muscle: Austen talks 'War Machine 2.0' & 'The Eternal' & 'World Watch' |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=February 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213231902/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=1944 |archive-date=February 13, 2009 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Austen described the plot as involving \"Ikaeden, the leader of the Eternals, who arrives on Earth at the dawn of man, and evolves humankind from [[Homo erectus|homo-erectus]] so he can use them as slaves to mine raw materials for the Celestials, his bosses, basically,\" as well as \"Kurassus, who is the second-in-command of the mining mission, and who is determined to undermine Ikaeden and kill Ikaeden's precious slave-girl and son.\"<ref name=cbr1944 /> In an interview with [[Newsarama]] he gave an outline of his planned plot:\n\n{{quote|In this version, we take some of the concepts from [the original series] and build around them, throwing away some stuff and keeping others.
