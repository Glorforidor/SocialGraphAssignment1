Carter was one of three central characters who [[first appeared]] in ''Night Nurse'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d November 1972), though she was previously the lead of another Marvel series, ''Linda Carter, Student Nurse'', published in 1961. Carter later adopted the name \"Night Nurse\" for herself, and in this incarnation, first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #58 (May 2004), as a medical professional specializing in helping injured [[superhero]]es.\n\n[[Rachel McAdams]] portrayed Christine Palmer in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016). This version is a surgeon who is an old friend of Doctor Strange.\n\n==Publication history==\n''Night Nurse'' was a Marvel Comics title that lasted four issues (cover-dated November 1972\u2013May 1973).<ref name=\"Cassell\">{{cite journal|last= Cassell|first= Dewey|title= Enter the World of Danger, Drama, and Death...Night Nurse|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 95|pages= 31\u201335|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= April 2017|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HjW8DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=night+nurse+daredevil+%2358&source=bl&ots=TWSWOFEYgw&sig=ENwEZ38fARSEYhW5ZCDTwjAUtLE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWidmVzbbUAhWCTSYKHREmAPc4ChDoAQgzMAM#v=onepage&q=night%20nurse%20daredevil%20%2358&f=false}}</ref> The [[medical drama]]/[[romance comics|romance]] series focused on the adventures of three female roommates who worked the night shift at the fictional Metropolitan General Hospital in [[New York City]]: Linda Carter, Georgia Jenkins, and Christine Palmer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/nightnrs.htm |title=Night Nurse |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66tWAUyPa?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/nightnrs.htm |archivedate=April 13, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Night Nurse'' was one of a trio of Marvel Comics of the time that were aimed at a female audience, alongside ''[[Tigra|The Claws of the Cat]]'' and ''[[Shanna the She-Devil]]''. Marvel writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]] recalled in 2007 that editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]] \"had the idea, and I think the names, for all three. He wanted to do some books that would have special appeal to girls. We were always looking for way to expand our franchise. My idea...was to try to get women to write them\".<ref>''Alter Ego'' #70 (July 2007): Roy Thomas interview, pp. 49-50</ref>\n\nThe series was written by writer Jean Thomas, who was at the time married to Roy Thomas, and by artist [[Win Mortimer|Winslow Mortimer]].<ref name=gcd>{{gcdb series|id= 2059|title= ''Night Nurse'' (Marvel, 1972 series)}}</ref> The stories, unlike most of Marvel's offerings at the time, contain no superheroes or fantastic elements. However, the night nurses encounter \"danger, drama and death\", as the cover tag proclaims, as they work to foil bomb plots, expose incompetent surgeons, and confront mob hitmen.\n\n''Night Nurse'' #4 is the only issue of the series that takes place away from Metro General and New York City. This story shifts from the urban drama of the first three issues and instead features Christine embroiled in a [[gothic fiction|gothic]] adventure, complete with a foreboding mansion, dusty secret passageways, and mysterious lights. Issue #4 was also the last of the series. In a 2010 interview, Jean Thomas offered her theory on the series's early cancellation: <blockquote>\"''Night Nurse'' was an attempt to create a comics book for the same audience of young girls who read such book series as ''[[Cherry Ames]]'', ''[[Sue Barton]]'', and ''[[Nancy Drew]]''. Maybe the comic-book format just didn't appeal to that group. It may also have been difficult to distribute or display: too serious to be with [[romance comics]] but not male-action oriented enough to be with [[superhero comics]], so, regrettably, low sales led to cancellation.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last= Weiss|first= Brett|date= October 2010|title= Spidey Super Stories|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 44| page= 25|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLinda Carter reappeared as a medical professional specializing in helping injured [[superhero]]es in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' (vol. 2) #58 (May 2004), written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and drawn by [[Alex Maleev]].
