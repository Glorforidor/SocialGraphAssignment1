Membership of the Corps is open to &#39;Decorated veterans of alien campaigns only&#39;.&lt;ref name=hdc1&gt;&#39;&#39;Human Defense Corps&#39;&#39; #1 (July 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Corps has bases all over Earth, including below the sea (Human Defense Base Area 53) and in space (Fort Olympus Orbital Defense Station).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Human Defense Corps&#39;&#39; #2 (August 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The sea-base included scientific facilities run by Doctor Zaius, a sentient gorilla from [[Gorilla City]], which experiments on captured [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrials]] and [[demon]]s, although its location has recently been moved off-Earth.\n\nTheir first mission comes when the 1st Special Armoured Division are sent on a reconnaissance trip to the former Soviet satellite [[Bulgravia]] to support Government troops who had encountered shape-shifting aliens with high firepower weaponry and assumed to be Durlans. They are attacked in the Forest of Galantz by vampiric aliens invisible to special tech weapons but not ordinary eyesight, and all but Sgt. Montgomery Kelly of the forward platoons, sixty-six men, are killed in the skirmish, some by blanket bombing of the area with &#39;holy napalm&#39;, a cross between holy water and fire-retardant gel which destroys the vampires. Sgt. Kelly and Colonel Reno Rosetti, who designed the weapon and ordered the attack on the drop site, are decorated as a result.&lt;ref name=hdc1 /&gt;\n\nSome time afterwards the Corps are involved in a &#39;centaur attack in Turkey&#39;, of which nothing is known,&lt;ref name=hdc3&gt;&#39;&#39;Human Defense Corps&#39;&#39; #3 (September 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and are also pursuing a drawn-out war against a mole-like race of underground people called the A&#39;Corti, specifically in [[London, England]].&lt;ref name=hdc3 /&gt;\n\nTwo years later, after dreams of the Galatz Forest incident affect a number of soldiers who were not there, a seance held by HDC Head Chaplain Charlie Graham&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Human Defense Corps&#39;&#39; #4 (October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; ascertains that the members of the Corps who were assumed killed in the incident are in [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] but not actually dead and the \&quot;vampires\&quot; they fought were actually demons. Interrogating Calcabrina, a captive demon from the incident, they discover a Bulgravian mage had made a deal for his village to be spared the ravages of civil war in exchange for 66 souls and the Human Defense Corps team had stumbled in and taken their place. The demon clan took them alive to feed on their energy - which is more powerful than the energy of the dead - as part of a plan to extend their power in Hell. Guided by Calcabrina, the Third Special Armoured Division invade Hell (code-named &#39;&#39; &#39;Trans-Dimensional Interactive Zone 4&#39; &#39;&#39; - &#39;&#39; &#39;T-Zone 4&#39; &#39;&#39;)&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Human Defense Corps&#39;&#39; #5 (November 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hdc6&gt;&#39;&#39;Human Defense Corps&#39;&#39; #6 (December 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; to recover the 66 Corps members. Sgt. Kelly is supposed killed by the demon he killed two years before in Galatz Forest - but discovers he has demon blood in him as a result of the incident and cannot die and is now blood related to the demon clan. He claims the staff of the demon clan&#39;s leader Lord Scarmiglione in battle, takes his place and the Corps rescue the 66 men. The five men who are killed in the sortie now also have demon links and unspecified powers and Sgt. Kelly and the five form a diplomatic link between Hell and Earth.&lt;ref name=hdc6 /&gt;\n\n===Project 7734===\nSeven years later [[Sam Lane (comics)|General Sam Lane]], [[Lois Lane|Lois Lane&#39;s]] father - who is assumed dead but, obsessed by alien invasion and &#39;the Kryptonian threat&#39;, has been working covertly on a programme for the U.S Government called [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Project 7734|Project 7734]] - has taken external command of [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Squad K|Squad K]] of the Human Defense Corps under Colonel Hazard as part of the Project and moved the main base of Project 7734 to the home planet of another dimension.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #691 (October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Corps now has a new motto and insignia &#39;&#39; &#39;Ad Infernos et Retrorsum&#39; &#39;&#39; (loosely meaning &#39;To Hell and Back&#39;) and suit technology and weaponry designed specifically to deal with Kryptonians. Squad K has nominally been &#39;&#39; &#39;created to neutralise and disarm specific Kryptonian threats&#39; &#39;&#39;, but this has been allocated to Major Krull, the villain Reactron, who is actually working directly for General Lane on Lane&#39;s own agenda - the destruction of all Kryptonians, including Superman.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Supergirl&#39;&#39; #45 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Reactron kills Colonel Hazard for opposing him in this.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #882 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe whereabouts of most of the original Corps team is currently unknown, although Sgt. Kelly is currently learning spell-casting with his team within Project 7734.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #692 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Membership ==\n&#39;&#39;Most of the current membership of Human Defense Corps is unknown as of January 2010, with the exception of Sgt. Kelly. The following have been mentioned as members of the Corps at some time:\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Colonel Skynner&#39;&#39;&#39; (&#39;&#39;Human Defense Corps&#39;&#39; #1).\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Colonel Hazard&#39;&#39;&#39; (Perseus Hazard) of K Squad - killed by [[Reactron]] for opposing his lethal actions (&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #882). He was the grandson of World War II hero [[Gravedigger (comics)|Ulysses \&quot;Gravedigger\&quot; Hazard]].\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Colonel Reno Rosetti&#39;&#39;&#39; (Lt. Rosetti in &#39;&#39;Human Defense Corps&#39;&#39; #1) - ordered the kill on the drop site in Galatz Forest, awarded DSM (&#39;&#39;Human Defense Corps&#39;&#39; #6).\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Sergeant Montgomery Kelly&#39;&#39;&#39; (Specialist First Class) ex-Marine - only survivor of the team from the first mission. Left in charge of Corps in Hell after gaining demonic powers, now on Earth in Section K studying spell-casting with his team.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Sergeant Chad Kiyahani&#39;&#39;&#39; - grandson of Louis \&quot;Little Sure Shot\&quot; Kiyahani from [[Sgt. Rock]]&#39;s [[Easy Company (comics)|Easy Company]]. Rescued from Hell.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Sergeant Dobbs&#39;&#39;&#39; - killed in Hell and became part of &#39;Kelly&#39;s 5&#39;.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Jake Grimaldi&#39;&#39;&#39; - part of the rescue team in Hell.
