Burkett got an assignment from DC Comics to create a new character and came up with Nemesis, a master of martial arts and disguise, who needed a daytime alias.

His default costume is a black turtleneck sweater with a [[Weighing scale#Balance|balance]] as a chest symbol and a chest holster.\n\nHe was an applicant to an unnamed government agency whose brother Craig was an undercover agent infiltrating a criminal syndicate called \&quot;[[The Council (comics)|the Council]]\&quot;. Craig was brainwashed into killing their family friend Ben Marshall and was subsequently killed in self-defense by fellow agents. Tom thus became \&quot;Nemesis\&quot;, preferring to use an alias instead of his dishonored family name. With the assistance of the [[Batman]], he cleared his brother&#39;s name and saw the men responsible for his brother&#39;s death dead.\n\nThis was covered in a backup series in &#39;&#39;The Brave and the Bold&#39;&#39; #166 through 192,&lt;ref name=\&quot;Trumbull\&quot; /&gt; with team-ups with the Batman in #170&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= [[Cary Burkett|Burkett, Cary]]|penciller= [[Jim Aparo|Aparo, Jim]]|inker= Aparo, Jim|story= ...If Justice Be Blind|title= [[The Brave and the Bold]]|issue= 170|date= January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; and #193.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= Burkett, Cary|penciller= Aparo, Jim|inker= Aparo, Jim|story= Those Who Live by the Sword...|title= The Brave and the Bold|issue= 193|date= December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nNemesis was apparently killed in the helicopter crash that killed the Council&#39;s leader, though he was later revealed to have survived, thanks to [[Amanda Waller]] and [[Rick Flag]]. He then became one of the few non-criminal members of the [[Suicide Squad]] as a means of paying off what he perceived as a debt. Nemesis became an occasional member of the Suicide Squad, assisting them from time to time, and fell in love with one of their members, [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]].\n\nDuring a mission in Moscow with the Suicide Squad, the team tried to rescue Zoya Trigorin. The mission was a failure, as she died in his arms, and he was taken into custody. Rick Flag and Nightshade set up a rescue mission for their teammate, and came into conflict with the [[Justice League]] because of it. Eventually, the two teams worked out their differences, and Nemesis was allowed to escape by the Justice League. He continued to work alongside the Squad, but left the team after conflicts with Amanda Waller. He later returned only shortly to help retrieve Flag&#39;s kidnapped son and to assist in trying to uncover a secret government cabal. This plot-point was never resolved.\n\nTresser was drafted into the [[Shadow Fighters]] to battle the villain [[Eclipso]]. He was originally the sole survivor of the Eclipso massacre that claimed the lives of the rest of the Shadow Fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Robert Loren Fleming|Fleming, Robert Loren]]|penciller= Newman, Audwynn Jermaine|inker= [[Ray Kryssing|Kryssing, Ray]]|story= Hour of Darkness|title= [[Eclipso]]|issue= 13|date= November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued the fight against Eclipso in a smaller recon-team that also included Nightshade and the matter-manipulator [[Chunk (comics)|Chunk]]. Nemesis and Chunk were saved from a nuclear bomb attack by Nightshade&#39;s powers.\n\n[[Image:nemesisWall.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Nemesis threatens Amanda Waller.]]\nAfter his involvement with the Suicide Squad and the Shadow Fighters ended, he apparently met his end - again - in the pages of &#39;&#39;[[Catwoman]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Catwoman62\&quot;&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Devin Grayson|Grayson, Devin]]|penciller= [[Jim Balent|Balent, Jim]]|inker= [[John Stanisci|Stanisci, John]]|story= Dog New Tricks|title= [[Catwoman]]|volume= 2|issue= 62|date= October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In &#39;&#39;[[Superman]] [[Secret Files and Origins|Secret Files 2004]],&#39;&#39; Nemesis was revealed to be alive and well, impersonating [[Sarge Steel]] and apparently working for a shadowy Cabal. Furthermore, in the last issue of the second volume of &#39;&#39;[[Suicide Squad]]&#39;&#39; the then-current team&#39;s erstwhile leader [[Sgt. Rock (comics)|Sgt. Rock]] is revealed to have been an impostor.  Given the events of the &#39;&#39;Superman Secret Files&#39;&#39;, \&quot;Rock\&quot; may well have been Nemesis for some or all of his appearances with the Squad.  The story of what happened to Nemesis between his &#39;death&#39; in &#39;&#39;Catwoman&#39;&#39; and subsequent reappearance in &#39;&#39;Superman Secret Files&#39;&#39; has not yet been told.\n\n[[One Year Later]] after the events of &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39;, Nemesis is seen aiding government agent Diana Prince, [[Wonder Woman]] in disguise, in the rescue of [[Donna Troy]] from several of the Amazon&#39;s villains. Nemesis is part of the newly re-opened [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#D.M.A.|Department of Metahuman Affairs]] under [[Sarge Steel]].\n\nAround this time, Nemesis assists in saving the life of the second [[Maxi-Man (comics)|Maxi-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Jodi Picoult|Picoult, Jodi]]|penciller= [[Drew Johnson (comics)|Johnson, Drew]]|inker= [[Ray Snyder|Snyder, Ray]]|story= Love and Murder, Part 1|title= [[Wonder Woman]]|volume= 3|issue= 6|date= Late May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the events of the &#39;&#39;[[Amazons Attack]]&#39;&#39; limited series, Nemesis questions the detainment of Wonder Woman by the D.M.A. and goes against orders to rescue her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Picoult, Jodi|penciller= [[Terry Dodson|Dodson, Terry]]|inker= [[Rachel Dodson|Dodson, Rachel]]|story= Love and Murder, Part 3|title= Wonder Woman|volume= 3|issue= 8|date= Late June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uncovers a plot by the villain [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] to trick the U.S. government into destroying [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] under false pretenses. During the Amazon counterattack, he is stung by several gigantic Stygian Killer Hornets, native to the Amazon Nation. Wonder Woman risks her life by traveling to Themyscira for an antidote and revives Nemesis back into health.\n\nShortly thereafter, Nemesis is again wounded in battle. While he is recovering in the hospital, Wonder Woman begins courting Tresser, in the traditional Amazon manner. After formally meeting her mother [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], he is inducted as a member of the Amazon race despite being a male. He is given the title of &#39;&#39;&#39;Sir Thomas of Cleveland&#39;&#39;&#39; and given the ranking of Guardsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|authorlink = Robert Greenberger |title = Wonder Woman: Amazon.

A group that, while altruistic, had no compunctions about killing or blurring the lines of legitimacy with their respective goals. She soon became romantically involved with her teammate Alexander Montez, a man who had managed to bind the demon [[Eclipso]] to himself, and for a time they were happy with one another. Of course, as with many such tragic romances, this was not meant to last for long. At some point in the series, Alex finally lost control of his body, allowing Eclipso to kill Soseh when her guard was down. Alex regained control, but it was too late. He committed suicide in remorse.\n\n===DC Rebirth: Pennyworth clone===\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Relationship of Tresser and Mykros==\nIn DC Comics continuity, Mykros does not seem to have any connection to Tresser except for the fact that they both battled organizations named \&quot;the Council\&quot; and as a result Tresser was killed in order for Mykros to debut in &#39;&#39;JSA&#39;&#39;. When asked in an interview what happened to Nemesis (Tom Tresser), why he was killed in &#39;&#39;Catwoman&#39;&#39; #62,&lt;ref name=\&quot;Catwoman62\&quot; /&gt; and was it true that his death was editorially mandated, &#39;&#39;Catwoman&#39;&#39; writer [[Devin Grayson]] explained:\n\n{{cquote|&#39;&#39;I was actually hoping to use Nemesis for the role in which I ended up using Trickster&amp;nbsp;\u2013 cheerful foil and potential romance. But yes, I was told that he was scheduled to be eighty-sixed&amp;nbsp;\u2013 an editor liked his name, but didn&#39;t like the character, and had plans, I guess, for a &#39;new&#39; Nemesis.&#39;&#39;\n\n&#39;&#39;He wasn&#39;t slated to die in &#39;&#39;Catwoman&#39;&#39;, but I figured that if he was on his way out, his death might as well be handled by someone who liked and respected him&amp;nbsp;\u2013 I tried really hard to show what a great character he was before I killed him in such a way as to ensure that should anyone change their mind, they could bring him back without too much trouble.&#39;&#39;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing23/iview.shtml|title= Devin Grayson: The Interview|first= Michael|last= Hutchison|year= 1999|website=  Fanzing.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120924063503/http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing23/iview.shtml|archivedate=September 24, 2012|url-status= live|df=mdy-all|accessdate= June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\n==In other media==\n[[Image:AnimatedNemesis.jpg|&#39;&#39;&#39;Nemesis&#39;&#39;&#39; from the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; animated series.|thumb]]\nNemesis (Thomas Andrew Tresser) has appeared as a background character in several episodes of &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39;.
