The most notable examples are commonly related to [[Namor]] of [[Marvel Comics]] and a [[Atlantis (Aquaman)|particular version]] of [[Aquaman]] in [[DC Comics]].\n\n==Marvel Comics version==\n===Mainstream version===\n&#39;&#39;&#39;Atlantis&#39;&#39;&#39; is a [[fiction]]al location appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It is based on the mythical island of [[Atlantis]] first mentioned in [[Plato]]&#39;s initial dialogue the &#39;&#39;[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]&#39;&#39;, written c. 360 B.C. In the [[Marvel Universe]], Atlantis was a small [[continent]] (about the same size as modern [[Australia]]) with many human settlements. Over 21,000 years ago, an event called the \&quot;Great Cataclysm\&quot; caused it to be submerged into the sea.\n\nThe inhabitants of ancient Atlantis built an enormous glass-like dome over the capital city, also known as Atlantis. When [[barbarian]]s sent by the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]]n empire attacked Atlantis, King [[Kamuu]] opened the magma-pits which were the city&#39;s means of heating. This caused the continent to sink.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Sub-Mariner&#39;&#39; #62, \&quot;Tales of Atlantis\&quot; backup story. Marvel Comics. Written by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Howard Chaykin]].&lt;/ref&gt; Kamuu was warned of the Great Cataclysm by the seer, Zhered-Na. When she refused to recant, he had her exiled to the mainland, where she was later stabbed to death by survivors of the submersion.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Fear&#39;&#39; #15. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Marvel Spotlight]]&#39;&#39; #17. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe priests and intellectuals of the city Netheria foresaw the Lemurian attack and fortified their city, and thus it sank intact. Netheria still exists today, ruled by Queen [[Kala (comics)|Kala]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Tales of Suspense]]&#39;&#39; #43. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient Atlanteans survived the sinking of the continent by various methods, including [[Dakimh the Enchanter]], [[Varnae]], and [[Stygyro]].\n\nAbout 8,000 years ago, a group of &#39;&#39;[[Homo mermanus]]&#39;&#39; nomads discovered the ruins of the city of Atlantis. They made the ruins of the human settlements in Atlantis their home and went on to develop a society there, using as much of the material as they could salvage from the wreckage. These people are thus often referred to as \&quot;Atlanteans\&quot;, as it is in the city of Atlantis that their first complex society emerged.{{Issue|date=March 2016}}\n\nFive hundred years after the settlement of Atlantis, another group of &#39;&#39;Homo mermanus&#39;&#39; left Atlantis to find their own city; this time in a part of the ruins of Lemuria, another continent submerged during the Great Cataclysm. These \&quot;Lemurians\&quot;, as they now call themselves, discovered the [[Serpent Crown]] in the ruins of their city. The Serpent Crown had been crafted by ancient Atlantean alchemists as a vessel empowered by the demonic Elder God [[Set (Serpent God)|Set]]. Through their leader [[Naga (comics)|Naga]]&#39;s exposure and extensive use of the ancient mystical device, they became more serpent-like in appearance than their Atlantean cousins.{{Issue|date=March 2016}}\n\nAtlanteans have had little or no contact with their human cousins for millennia. However, the two races came into sustained contact, often hostile, beginning in the 20th century. On occasions, Atlanteans have invaded the surface world.{{Issue|date=March 2016}} The current Prince, [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], was initially hostile to the surface world, but fought in alliance with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] against the [[Axis Powers]] during [[World War II]].{{Issue|date=March 2016}} Namor defends Atlantis against villains like [[Attuma]] and the warlord [[Krang (Marvel Comics)|Krang]], who plot to overthrow him and take over Atlantis.{{Issue|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe city of Atlantis was damaged when the supervillain [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] exploded, taking with him Namor&#39;s traitorous son, Kamar.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Sub-Mariner&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #1-6 (August 2007 - January 2008). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFollowing Namor&#39;s attack on [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] during &#39;&#39;[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]&#39;&#39;, the two nations engaged in a violent conflict. After much bloodshed, Namor reached out to the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and extended a peace offering to [[Shuri (comics)|Queen Shuri]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;New Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #7. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Wakanda launched an all-out strike on Atlantis, destroying the city and killing a number of Namor&#39;s soldiers in the process.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;New Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #8. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Other versions===\n*In &#39;&#39;Tales of Suspense&#39;&#39; #43, [[Iron Man]] meets a separate tribe of Atlanteans whose city sank to the bottom of the sea and has been renamed the Netherworld. He soon discovers that their Queen, [[Kala (comics)|Kala]], is planning to invade the surface with advanced technology. Iron Man stops her by bringing her to the surface, where it is revealed that Netherworlders age rapidly when above ground. Though she is restored to her desired age when she returns to the Netherworld, Kala\u2019s hopes of ruling the surface world are greatly diminished, though she later attempts to do so several more times, all without success.\n**In a \u201cTuk the Caveboy\u201d story sequence from &#39;&#39;[[Captain America]]&#39;&#39; #2 and 3 (1941), Tuk and Tanir (a [[Cro-Magnon]] man) meet Eve, princess of the not-yet lost kingdom of Atlantis, whom they aid in reclaiming the throne from her wicked uncle.\n*The [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] visited other realities that had their own version of Atlantis. On Earth-1016, the Exiles came across a reality where the forces of Atlantis were exterminating mankind. They teamed up with that reality&#39;s Doctor Doom to fend off the Atlanteans.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Exiles&#39;&#39; #14. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] has its version of Atlantis. Proteus rose Atlantis to the surface and trapped the Atleanteans inside as a way to suffocate them.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Exiles&#39;&#39; #82. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n*In the &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Noir]]&#39;&#39; reality, Atlantis matched the descriptions of [[Plato]] with it being near the Pillars of Heracles, being highly-advanced, and powered by the Orichalcum. As the Orichalcum proved to be too powerful to be the Atlantean&#39;s superconductor, it created a vortex that sunk Atlantis beneath the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man Noir&#39;&#39; #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n*The ruins of the [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Atlantis are discovered by the [[Fantastic Four]] during an expedition. Unlike its [[Earth-616]] counterpart, this version of Atlantis is shown to have been devoid of any life for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; #23. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon being found by the Four, Namor suggests that the continent had been destroyed by Lemuria at some point during his time in stasis.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; #24. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; During the &#39;&#39;[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]&#39;&#39; storyline, it is revealed that the ruins of Atlantis do contain a small pocket of survivors led by [[Namora]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; #60. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==DC Comics versions==\n{{see also|Atlantis (Aquaman)}}\n===Publication history===\nOne of the earliest mentions of Atlantis occurs in &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39; #17, in a \&quot;[[Zatara|Zatara the Magician]]\&quot; story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquamanshrine.com/2011/02/in-search-of-atlantis-contest-update.html |title=In Search of Atlantis Contest: Conclusion! |publisher=The Aquaman Shrine |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2011-08-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810010022/http://www.aquamanshrine.com/2011/02/in-search-of-atlantis-contest-update.html |archivedate=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was visually depicted in the following month&#39;s \&quot;Zatara\&quot; story in &#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #18.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39; #17 (October 1939). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe city appeared in several DC comics of the 1940s and 1950s: \n*In &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #19, Atlantis is shown to be inhabited by an advanced people ruled by an Emperor. The [[Nazi]]s have discovered Atlantis and are using it as a naval base. [[Batman]] and Robin discover the base and are able to reveal the deception of the Nazis.\n*In &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Family]]&#39;&#39; #10, Atlantis appears. It was sunk about 8000 B.C. by an earth fault below the island, but the [[Sivana]] Family hope to use an element there for a machine to prevent the Marvels from calling their lightning down. A scientist, Chal-Patzun, hoped to have Atlantis raised in the future by his descendants, his son having gone to the mainland. He had discovered an element called Protium, which in 10,000 years would become Neutrium, and in another 10,000 years, Electrium. A machine powered by this would raise the island. Before Atlantis sinks, Georgia Sivana, having traveled to the past, steals a vial of Protium. During the 20th century his descendant, Dr. Charles Patterson, is shot by Sivana while in the vault after he tries to stop him from taking Neutrium. It is raised around A.D. 12,000 by Dr. Charles Patterson&#39;s own descendant, Chass Passon, though two of the vials had been stolen by the Sivanas in the past and present, leaving just eight. Sivana Jr. succeeds in taking a vial of Electrium just after the island is raised. Atlantis is apparently located around the Atlantic coast latitude 35. See more on the [[List of Marvel Family enemies|Sivana Family]] in conflicting depictions before a more consistent portrayal began with an \&quot;[[Aquaman]]\&quot; story in &#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39; #260, in a story by writer [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] and artist [[Ramona Fradon]], based on the real-world mythology of [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39; #260 (May 1959). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn [[DC Comics]], several characters, including [[Aquaman]] and [[Lori Lemaris]] - among others - are said to have come from a sunken Atlantis. Due to a combination of [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] and advanced [[science]], they survive with the ability to breathe under[[water]]. There are several Atlantean civilizations in the [[DC Universe]], the most notable being the recently destroyed Poseidonis (home to Aquaman and other humanoid water breathers) and Tritonis (home to Lemaris and other [[Mermaid|mer-people]]). Aquaman is from the royal family of Atlantis. [[Arion (comics)|Arion]] is another depicted lord of Atlantis. He is a fictional [[sword and sorcery]] hero published by the American company DC Comics. He debuted in &#39;&#39;Warlord&#39;&#39; #55 (March 1982), and was created by [[Paul Kupperberg]] and [[Jan Duursema]].\nThe history of Atlantis was detailed in &#39;&#39;The Atlantis Chronicles&#39;&#39;, a 7-issue [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] published by [[DC Comics]] from March 1990 through September 1990. It was written by [[Peter David]], and illustrated by [[Esteban Maroto]]. The series focused on a series of Atlantean historical manuscripts, also called &#39;&#39;The Atlantis Chronicles&#39;&#39;, and chronicled the rise and fall of Atlantis. Each issue dealt with a separate era or event in Atlantis&#39; past, beginning with its sinking, as told through the royal historian&#39;s point of view.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[The Sandman: Brief Lives]],&#39;&#39; by writer [[Neil Gaiman]], a chapter called \&quot;The People Who Remember Atlantis\&quot; speaks of \&quot;echo-Atlantises\&quot; and (many) other equatable prehistoric civilizations, and explores the theme of the bulk of human [[history]] and knowledge being lost to the modern world.\n\n===Zodiac artifacts===\n====Zodiac Crystals====\nThe Atlantean Royal Seal is one of 12 powerful mystical artifacts known as the Zodiac Crystals. The 12 crystals were created by Calcuha and Majistra, the parents of [[Arion (comics)|Lord Arion of Atlantis]]. The 12 artifacts are able to tap into the magical energy of the Earth to perform sorcerous feats and [[geomancy]]. The 12 crystals resurfaced in &#39;&#39;Aquaman&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #1, where they were in the possession of [[Ocean Master|Orm Marius]], the Ocean Master.\n\n====Zodiac Coins====\nThere were also 12 Atlantean Zodiac Coins, which Doctor Zodiac and [[Madame Zodiac]] used to power their Zodiac Idol; the coins were last seen in &#39;&#39;World&#39;s Finest Comics&#39;&#39; #288 (February 1983).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;World&#39;s Finest Comics&#39;&#39; #288 (February 1983). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Atlantean colonies===\nThere have been other undersea cities called Atlantis in various DC comics titles. They include:\n\n* {{visible anchor|Sub Diego list|text=Sub Diego}}, first depicted in &#39;&#39;[[Aquaman]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 6) #16 (April 2004) and home of Mayor [[Cal Durham]] and [[Aquagirl (Lorena Marquez)|Lorena Marquez]]. It consists of a portion of San Diego that was submerged in an attempt to convert humans into sub-aquatic beings. The population consists of a mix of these altered humans and Atlantian refugees.\n* The city of Tritonis, home of King Iqula, Queen S&#39;ona, Lenora Lemaris, [[Lori Lemaris]], and Ronno the Mer-Man (formerly Mer-Boy).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #107 (July 1959). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* The [[coral]] outcropping known as Mercy Reef, location where [[Aquaman]] was abandoned at birth.\n* The twin cities of Shayeris and Crastinus in the Hidden Valley, home of the Idyllists and birthplace of [[Aqualad]].\n* The city of Hy-Brasil, home of the Hy-Brazilians, their entire city is a floating war machine.\n* The Atlantean outpost city of Venturia, domain of [[Queen Clea]], a foe of Wonder Woman&#39;s.\n* The city of Aurania, enemies of the city of Venturia and Queen Clea.\n* The city of Tlapallan, populated by a sub-species of [[Aztec]] styled onyx-skinned Atlanteans.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Aquaman&#39; 1986\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Aquaman&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #1 (February 1986).

Once inhabited by the most advanced society in history, the city is believed to be adrift and derelict in the highest pockets of the sky. Much like Atlantis, Camlantis is a utopian society whose people perished overnight due to a great cataclysm; however, Camlantis resides in the air, as opposed to the watery grave of Atlantis.\n* In the now-defunct [[CrossGen|CrossGen Comics]], [[Atlantis (CrossGen Comics)|Atlantis]] was the basis for the fictional universe known as the &#39;&#39;[[Sigilverse]].&#39;&#39;\n* In the webcomic [[Wigu]], the Tinkle family as well as the head of the [[Illuminati]] are of Atlantean heritage.

The title character is an alien who founded Atlantis in the distant past upon discovering Earth, with Atlantis serving as a home for all collected knowledge. Captain Newfoundland has since served as a protector of Earth, granting powers to new superheroes like [[Captain Canada (comics)|Captain Canada]] to watch over their own countries.\n* Atlantis plays a role and is a location (both as the original island and a space-relocated counterpart in the present time) in several adventures of the [[Scrameustache]] character by Franco-Belgian author Gos, notably in &#39;&#39;Le Cristal des Atlantes&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;L&#39;\u00c9preuve du sablier&#39;&#39;.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n*[https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Atlantis Atlantis] in Marvel Database\n*[https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Atlantis Atlantis] in DC Database\n\n[[Category:Atlantis]]\n[[Category:Atlantis in fiction]]\n[[Category:Fictional locations in comics]]&quot;</span>
