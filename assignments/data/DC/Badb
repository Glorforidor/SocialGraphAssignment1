Artist [[Luke McDonnell]]\n|name=Onslaught\n|publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n|debut=&#39;&#39;[[Suicide Squad]]&#39;&#39; vol.1 #1,&lt;br&gt; (May 1987)\n|creators=[[John Ostrander]] (writer)&lt;br&gt;[[Luke McDonnell]] (artist)\n|base= [[Qurac]]\n|members= \n [[#Roster|Roster below]]\n|subcat=DC Comics\n|hero=\n|villain= y\n}}\n\nThe &#39;&#39;&#39;Onslaught&#39;&#39;&#39; are a [[fictional]] team of state sponsored super powered [[Qurac]]i terrorists published by [[DC Comics]]. They first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Suicide Squad]]&#39;&#39; volume 1 #1, and were created by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Luke McDonnell]].\n\n==History==\nThe Onslaught is a team of super-powered international terrorists-for-hire operating out of the outlaw nation of [[Qurac]]. The team was created and guided by Qurac&#39;s President Marlos and had accepted, as its first commission, the assignment of killing the [[President of the United States]]. Former Suicide Squad member Jess Bright, now a Soviet operative named Koshchei helped bioengineer candidates for the team. At its inception, the Jihad was infiltrated by [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]] and [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]], members of the advance team of the Suicide Squad, and was the target of a preemptive attack by the Squad. (As seen in &#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; vol. 1 #1 and 2)&lt;ref name=\&quot;cosmicteams\&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/j.html |title=Cosmic Teams! |last= |first= |date= |website=Mykey3000 |publisher= |accessdate=February 9, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429094017/http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/j.html|archivedate=April 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter their first clash with the Suicide Squad, Raza Kattuah now calling himself Rustam formed a second team based in an old [[World War II]] fortress called [[Jotunheim]] in southern Qurac. The name translates as \&quot;Land of the Giants\&quot;, because the Germans believed only a race of giants could have built those mountains. Rustam used this team to terrorize civilians in [[New York City]]. Ravan, Ifrit and Agni were captured. Manticore and Jaculi were killed, but Rustam and Badb were able to escape. Ravan was eventually recruited by the Suicide Squad. [[Rick Flag]] carried out an unauthorized solo mission to Qurac which resulted in the destruction of Jotunheim, killing Rustam and countless Jihad members. The man known as [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Kobra]] would later kill Ravan while engaged in single combat.&lt;ref name=\&quot;cosmicteams\&quot;/&gt;\n[[Image:Onslaughtdcu2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Amanda Waller briefs the Suicide Squad, artist [[Luke McDonnell]]]]\nAgni assembled a small three-person team to free Quraci &#39;&#39;&#39;President Marlo&#39;&#39;&#39; from United States custody. He brought along Badb, and the Atlantean renegade known as Piscator, a self-styled [[Janissary]]. The Suicide Squad preemptively substituted Nemesis for President Marlo. At the same time, Israel&#39;s heroes, the [[Mossad]] superteam known as the [[Hayoth]] were involved in a covert mission on U.S. soil, a failed attempt to abduct Marlo.&lt;ref name=\&quot;cosmicteams\&quot;/&gt;\n\nAs revealed in &#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; #50, Jess Bright had survived the [[Yeti]] attack in [[Tibet]], that killed most of the original Suicide Squad. Jess was rescued by the [[Red Chinese]] and given a new name &#39;&#39;Yen Wang&#39;&#39; (King of the Devils) and was made the head of a secret Chinese project to develop [[metahuman]]s alongside a Chinese scientist named Deng Zho-Zhi. Unfortunately due to frostbite his nose, lips, toes and fingers all had to be amputated. Deng Zho-Zhi&#39;s laboratory was raided by Chinese government officials, and he revealed to Bright that he was actually a dissident and probably would be taken away for [[:wikt:reeducation|reeducation]]. Jess is recruited from prison by &#39;&#39;&#39;Major Zastrow&#39;&#39;&#39; of the [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Red Shadows|Red Shadows]]. The Russians gave him cybernetic hands, and cybernetic feet that allowed him to walk again. Zastrow changes Bright&#39;s codename to &#39;&#39;Koschei the Deathless&#39;&#39; and put him to work on maintaining and improving the [[Rocket Red]]s. The Russians then sent him to Qurac where he was put in charge of the program to develop Qurac&#39;s metahuman program, Jaculi, Manticore and the Djinn were all his creations. Unfortunately he was killed when Rick Flag destroyed Jotunheim with an [[Atomic Bomb]]. But the Quracis were able to revive him as a cybernetic [[zombie]] using technology he himself had created, his body was dead and his mind was a digital recording. As part of an elaborate revenge against Rick Flag, Koschei kidnaps his son by Karin Grace, Rick Flag Jr. Unbeknownst to Koschei Flag had apparently died in the nuclear detonation that destroyed Jotunheim. Nemesis eventually convinced him to set the boy free, and he appeared to have been destroyed by an explosion that he set off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[John Ostrander]]|cowriters=[[Kim Yale]]|penciller=[[Geof Isherwood]]|copencillers=[[Luke McDonnell]], [[Grant Miehm]]|inker=[[Karl Kesel]]|coinkers=Geof Isherwood, Luke McDonnell|colorist=McCraw, Tom|letterer=[[Todd Klein|Klein, Todd]]|editor=[[Dan Raspler|Raspler, Dan]]|title= Suicide Squad|volume= 1|issue= #50|date=February, 1991|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAgni assembled yet another Onslaught team with the help of Njara Kattuah son of Rustam. This new team&#39;s mission of vengeance against America was short-lived. After disposing of a team of [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] Knights who had tracked them as far as Markovia, the homeland of [[Geo-Force]], they were discovered on an [[airplane]] bound for [[Gotham City|Gotham]] by the Outsiders, who were also on the flight, and a fight broke out onboard the plane. The battle in midair nearly cost some of the Outsiders their lives, but Manticore III and Dahak both ended up dying instead, with Djinn presumably killed as well. After a crash landing in Gotham, all the surviving members except for Dervish escaped. Dervish later joined the Outsiders in order to find Manticore, who she thought was alive, remaining with them until she discovered what happened to Manticore. In anger she joined the second [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Strikeforce Kobra]]. After a clash with the Outsiders, she was captured and imprisoned in the Slab, she later escaped when the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] engineered a jailbreak. (As seen in Joker: Last Laugh #3)&lt;ref name=\&quot;cosmicteams\&quot;/&gt;\n\nNjara later returned with a new team including Antiphon, Tolteca, Hyve and Digital Djinn. (&#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #10) They succeeded in kidnapping [[Amanda Waller]] as part of an elaborate revenge, and in killing Squad members Havana (slain by Rustam) and Modem (slain by Digital Djinn). They were no match for the Squad when members of the [[Justice Society of America]] were drafted to help. The second Rustam was killed by [[Deadshot]] and the other members escaped custody.&lt;ref name=\&quot;cosmicteams\&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Roster==\n\n===Team one (Suicide Squad vol. 1 #1-2)===\n[[Image:Onslaughtdcu1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Onslaught team five, artist [[Paco Medina]]]]\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Chimera&#39;&#39;&#39; - She was actually Suicide Squad member [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]].\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Djinn&#39;&#39;&#39; - His body was reduced to a binary code and stored in microchips within a [[magnetic bottle]].

According to Raza he was a US covert operative in Qurac who was apparently betrayed by the United States, a situation which led to the deaths of his entire family.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Suicide Squad: Raising the Flag&#39;&#39; #2&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Team two (Suicide Squad vol. 1 #17-19)===\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Agni&#39;&#39;&#39; - Agni is an [[Asian Indian]] pyrokinetic who could create progressively larger fireballs by snapping his fingers.
