He is a private detective who exists in DC&#39;s main shared universe. The character concept was envisioned by DC Comics founder Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson and the character was created by collaboration of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, who both later became more well known as the creator of Superman. The fictional characer first appears in the Golden Age of Comic Books in the anthology title Detective Comics being introduced in the first issue.  He later commonly was associated with Batman and other spinoff Batman characters when revived.\nSlam Bradley was portrayed in live-action by Kurt Szarka in the first season of Batwoman.\n\n\n== Creation ==\n\nConceived by Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson and developed by Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the character first appeared in Detective Comics #1 (March 1937) and is depicted as a hard bitten, tough private eye who loves working for dames, but prefers the platonic company of his boy sidekick \&quot;Shorty\&quot; Morgan. The character originally starred in his own stories during the Golden Age, and later was revived in supporting character roles.\nSlam Bradley was originally outlined by Wheeler-Nicholson in a May 13, 1936 letter to Jerry Siegel, who had previously created with Joe Shuster DC&#39;s character Doctor Occult. The letter stated: \&quot;We need some more work from you. We are getting out at least one new magazine in July and possibly two. The first one is definitely in the works. It will contain longer stories and fewer. From you and Shuster we need sixteen pages monthly. We want a detective hero called &#39;Slam Bradley&#39;. He is to be an amateur, called in by the police to help unravel difficult cases. He should combine both brains and brawn, be able to think quickly and reason cleverly and able as well to slam bang his way out of a bar room brawl or mob attack. Take every opportunity to show him in a torn shirt with swelling biceps and powerful torso ala Flash Gordon. The pages are to run the same size as New Comics but to contain eight panels a page instead of six.\&quot;\n\n\n== Comics appearances ==\n\n\n=== Golden Age of Comics ===\nThe character first appeared as one of several ongoing features, in the debut issue of Detective Comics \u2013 originally an anthology series \u2013 in March 1937. He debuted a year before Superman&#39;s first appearance, and two years before Batman would become the title&#39;s lead feature. The character&#39;s adventures continued as Batman was introduced in issue #27, continuing as a supporting feature until Detective Comics #152 (October 1949). According to Jess Nevins&#39; Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \&quot;He fights ordinary criminals, Yellow Perils, stage magicians, the Human Fly, creatures from the year Two Billion, the Man-Beast, and on at least one occasion space aliens.\&quot;Slam was replaced in Detective #153 by Roy Raymond, TV Detective. Bradley would not make another significant appearance for over 32 years and his sidekick Shorty Morgan disappeared completely.The character was originally operating out of Cleveland, then later in New York City, Slam and his sidekick \&quot;Shorty\&quot; Morgan often had humorous, fight-filled adventures, often going undercover in various professions to catch their man. Though most stories had a mystery element, \&quot;Slam\&quot; was more likely to solve them with his fists than his brains.\n\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe character reappeared in Detective Comics #500 (March 1981). In a story titled \&quot;The Too Many Cooks... Caper!\&quot;, an aging Bradley joined other DC detectives, such as Jason Bard, Pow-Wow Smith, Roy Raymond, the Human Target, and Mysto, Magician Detective in solving the murder of a fellow retiring detective. The character returned again in Detective Comics #572 (the 50th anniversary issue), teaming up with detectives Batman, Robin, Elongated Man, and Sherlock Holmes.\nHe appeared in the Superman titles in the 1990s, working for the Metropolis Police Department. However, this incarnation of the character was short-lived. When an older Slam Bradley later appeared in Detective Comics, it was explained that the Metropolis character was Slam Bradley, Jr.In 2001, writer Ed Brubaker and artist Darwyn Cooke revived the character in the four-part serial \&quot;Trail of the Catwoman\&quot; in Detective Comics #759-762. In this story, he investigates the death of Selina Kyle and in the process runs afoul of the Batman. This incarnation of the character is a former police officer in his late 50s who has always worked in Gotham City (contradicting the previous Cleveland, New York, and Metropolis settings). Bradley then became a supporting cast member in the Catwoman ongoing series. He reveals that he has a son, Sam Bradley Jr., on the Gotham City Police Department. Sam Jr. and Selina Kyle engaged in a romantic relationship that produced a child, Helena Kyle. The character appears in Darwyn Cooke&#39;s 2003/2004 DC: The New Frontier as a private investigator working alongside Detective John Jones, and in Cooke&#39;s Solo #5.\nSlam made an appearance during a flashback in the story arc \&quot;Heart of Hush\&quot;, where he was the primary detective in the murder of Thomas Elliot&#39;s father.\n\n\n=== Outside mainstream coninuity ===\nSlam was featured in the out-of-continuity DC: The New Frontier. He also appeared in  Legends of the Dark Knight #5, in which he had to team up with Batman to clear his name of a murder charge. This story was released digitally as Legends of the Dark Knight #11-13.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\&quot;Slam\&quot; Bradley appears in the direct-to-video animated film Justice League: The New Frontier, voiced by Jim Meskimen. He also appears in the Batwoman episode \&quot;How Queer Everything Is Today!\&quot;, portrayed by Kurt Szarka in which he is depicted as a member of the Gotham City Police Department. \n\n\n== Golden Age controversy ==\nThe character Slam Bradley has, from its early onset, been embedded in a history of racism, in which the character is juxtaposed against Yellow Peril caricatures.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Grand Comics Database\nSlam Bradley at Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia.
