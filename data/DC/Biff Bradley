He is a [[private detective]] who exists in [[DC Universe|DC&#39;s main shared universe]]. The character concept was envisioned by [[DC Comics]] founder [[Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson]] and the character was created by collaboration of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]], who both later became more well known as the creator of [[Superman]]. The fictional characer first appears in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] in the anthology title &#39;&#39;[[Detective Comics]]&#39;&#39; being introduced in the first issue.  He later commonly was associated with [[Batman]] and other spinoff Batman characters when revived.\n\nSlam Bradley was portrayed in [[Live action|live-action]] by Kurt Szarka in the first season of &#39;&#39;[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;who\&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Donoho |first1=Timothy |title=Batwoman: Who Is Slam Bradley? |url=https://www.cbr.com/batwoman-who-is-slam-bradley/ |website=CBR |accessdate=18 September 2020 |date=26 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Creation ==\n[[File:Slam Bradley&#39;s debut in Detective Comics 1 (March 1937).png|thumb|upright|left|First appearance of Slam Bradley, from &#39;&#39;[[Detective Comics]]&#39;&#39; #1, March 1937. Art by [[Joe Shuster]]. ]]\nConceived by [[Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson]] and developed by Superman creators [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]], the character first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Detective Comics]]&#39;&#39; #1 (March 1937) and is depicted as a hard bitten, tough private eye who loves working for dames, but prefers the platonic company of his boy sidekick \&quot;Shorty\&quot; Morgan.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character originally starred in his own stories during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]], and later was revived in supporting character roles.\n&#39;&#39;Slam Bradley&#39;&#39; was originally outlined by Wheeler-Nicholson in a May 13, 1936 letter to Jerry Siegel, who had previously created with Joe Shuster DC&#39;s character [[Doctor Occult]]. The letter stated: \&quot;We need some more work from you. We are getting out at least one new magazine in July and possibly two. The first one is definitely in the works. It will contain longer stories and fewer. From you and Shuster we need sixteen pages monthly. We want a detective hero called &#39;Slam Bradley&#39;. He is to be an amateur, called in by the police to help unravel difficult cases. He should combine both brains and brawn, be able to think quickly and reason cleverly and able as well to slam bang his way out of a bar room brawl or mob attack. Take every opportunity to show him in a torn shirt with swelling biceps and powerful torso ala [[Flash Gordon]]. The pages are to run the same size as &#39;&#39;[[New Comics]]&#39;&#39; but to contain eight panels a page instead of six.\&quot;\n\n== Comics appearances ==\n===Golden Age of Comics===\nThe character first appeared as one of several ongoing features, in the debut issue of &#39;&#39;[[Detective Comics]]&#39;&#39; \u2013 originally an [[anthology]] series \u2013 in March 1937. He debuted a year before [[Superman]]&#39;s [[first appearance]], and two years before [[Batman]] would become the title&#39;s lead feature.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Slam Bradley | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 59  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character&#39;s adventures continued as Batman was introduced in issue #27, continuing as a supporting feature until &#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; #152 (October 1949). According to &#39;&#39;Jess Nevins&#39; Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes&#39;&#39;, \&quot;He fights ordinary criminals, [[Yellow Peril]]s, stage magicians, the Human Fly, creatures from the year Two Billion, the Man-Beast, and on at least one occasion space aliens.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSlam was replaced in &#39;&#39;Detective&#39;&#39; #153 by &#39;&#39;[[Roy Raymond (comics)|Roy Raymond, TV Detective]]&#39;&#39;. Bradley would not make another significant appearance for over 32 years and his sidekick Shorty Morgan disappeared completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/slambrad.htm |title=Slam Bradley}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe character waz originally operating out of [[Cleveland]], then later in [[New York City]], Slam and his sidekick \&quot;Shorty\&quot; Morgan often had humorous, fight-filled adventures, often going undercover in various professions to catch their man. Though most stories had a mystery element, \&quot;Slam\&quot; was more likely to solve them with his fists than his brains.&lt;ref name=\&quot;who\&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Revival===\nThe character reappeared in &#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; #500 (March 1981). In a story titled \&quot;The Too Many Cooks... Caper!\&quot;, an aging Bradley joined other DC detectives, such as [[Jason Bard]], [[Pow-Wow Smith]], Roy Raymond, the [[Human Target]], and [[Mysto|Mysto, Magician Detective]] in solving the murder of a fellow retiring detective. The character returned again in &#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; #572 (the 50th anniversary issue), teaming up with detectives Batman, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Elongated Man]], and [[Sherlock Holmes]].\n\nHe appeared in the [[Superman]] titles in the 1990s, working for the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=37\u201338}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this incarnation of the character was short-lived.
