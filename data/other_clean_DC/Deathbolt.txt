Doug Jones portrayed a version of Deathbolt in the live-action television series, Arrow, in the season three episode "Broken Arrow". Significantly, he was the first metahuman villain to appear on the series, with the ability to control and shoot plasma. By the end of the episode, it was revealed that he did not receive his powers from the particle accelerator explosion at Central City—as he was in prison in Opal City on the night of the explosion—but from another unknown means, widening the possibilities of how metahumans come about in the Arrowverse.Deathbolt also appears as one of the villains in The Flash episode "Rogue Air", portrayed again by Doug Jones. As he was about to kill The Flash, he is himself killed by Captain Cold because in Cold's own words said: "He owed me money".
