== Fictional team history ==


=== Golden Age ===


==== Wizard's Injustice Society ====
It is unknown under what circumstances the Injustice Society was formed. The group first appeared in the second half of the 1940s, led by the Wizard and planning to take over America. Fragmenting into individual efforts, the ISW launched strikes against government facilities around the nation, each with his own private army of convicts due to five jailbreaks engineered by the ISW. In addition to furthering their primary aims, the villains were each assigned to capture a member of the JSA in anticipated resistance. To ensure that the JSA showed up, the villains notified the heroes of their plans. In due course, Hawkman was captured by Vandal Savage at an airport which the criminal army had surrounded, and Doctor Mid-Nite was apprehended by Per Degaton who was attacking the Washington Monument. Flash fell victim to his long-time foe Thinker at the Governor's house where the Thinker was broadcasting fake demands by the Governor to make the armed forces stand down, due to invisible wires, and Atom was snared by Gambler. Green Lantern arrives in Uthorium Town just as the armed forces are closing in on the criminals that control the city. Suddenly, the town disappears in a flash of light. Green Lantern begins a search for the criminal army, when he discovers the town has re-appeared a few miles away, and the felons are looting uthorium from a lab. Green Lantern zooms in for the attack, when the Brainwave appears on the scene, opening a canister of uthorium in his presence. Blinded, Green Lantern forms an energy bubble for protection while Brainwave and his men finish their job. Recovering later. Green Lantern discovers a radioactive trail left behind by the uthorium and follows it, discovering some of the thugs with an invention called the "Mirage-Thrower," which fools the Army tanks into crossing a frozen lake which really isn't frozen. Green Lantern saves the tanks and men, then follows the trail to discover Brainwave inside a weird glass box. Firing his power ring at it, the ray bounces back, knocking Green Lantern off a cliff, apparently to his death! Hearing of Per Degaton's capture of Doctor Mid-Nite in Capital City (evidently meant to be based on Washington), Wonder Woman and Johnny Thunder left the JSA HQ to intervene, only to be captured themselves. The JSA were held by a will-deadener beam, put on "trial" before Judge Thinker with the Wizard as Prosecutor, and sentenced to death, but it was then revealed Green Lantern had disguised himself as the Thinker. His ring saved him at the last moment and he captured the Thinker. He freed the others and they defeated the Injustice Society, with the Wizard being caught by the Junior Justice Society.


==== Second Injustice Society ====
The second formation appeared in the late 1940s attempting "patriotic crimes" where it was formed by Wizard and consisted of Fiddler, Harlequin, Huntress, Icicle, and Sportsmaster. They stole national monuments, hoping the American people would vote for the best crime allowing that person to become the leader, and succeeding in erasing the Society's memories after capturing them by the Sportsmaster knocking them out with one of his bombs, but Harlequin turned against them and with Black Canary restored the Justice Society's memories, though a post-hypnotic impulse restores the JSA to their mindless states when they hear fingers snapping, causing them to be recaptured. But their memories are restored again after they are placed in a death chamber, leading to Black Canary becoming a proper member.


=== Silver Age ===
The Injustice Society reforms during the 1970s to eliminate the reformed Justice Society. First, the Fiddler fetches Solomon Grundy and defeats Wildcat and Hawkman, but they are defeated by Kal-L and Power Girl. Vandal Savage tricks the JSA into aiding a false Camelot while the Icicle, Thinker, Wizard, and Brainwave capture Wildcat and Hourman. The Thinker and the Icicle are defeated by Doctor Fate, Hawkman, and Jay Garrick, while the Wizard and Brainwave are defeated by Power Girl and the Star-Spangled Kid. The Wizard then left the Injustice Society for Earth-One, where he joined the Secret Society of Super-Villains. Brainwave captures Green Lantern, Jay Garrick, and Power Girl before being defeated in Power Girl's first solo adventure.


=== Post-Crisis ===


==== Injustice Unlimited ====
During what some described as the "anti-costumed-hero mania" (as chronicled in the DC mini-series Legends) in the pages of Infinity, Inc., the Wizard gathered both old comrades (consisting of Brainwave, Fiddler, Gambler, Harlequin, Per Degaton, Shade, Solomon Grundy, Sportsmaster, Thinker, and Vandal Savage) and new super-criminals (consisting of Hazard, Icicle II, and Tigress III) into a new Injustice Society which he called "Injustice Unlimited". Indeed, the criminal group seemed to be a mirror image of Infinity, Inc., which itself was an offshoot of the Justice Society. Later, this team returned to the original name.


==== Johnny Sorrow's Injustice Society ====
Johnny Sorrow appears in late 1999, as the leader of the new Injustice Society (consisting of the Icicle, Blackbriar Thorn, Count Vertigo, Geomancer, Killer Wasp, and Tigress). Together they storm the headquarters of superhero team Justice Society of America, although JSA member Wildcat defeats them all (destroying Blackbriar Thorn) despite still recovering from a broken arm and the attack initially being launched while he was in the bath, with the exception of Sorrow, who uses the diversion to steal an unknown artifact.Sorrow returns with a larger version of the Injustice Society (having also recruited Black Adam after removing a brain tumour, Shiv, Rival, and the Thinker A.I.) to distract the JSA while he summoned the King of Tears, an other-dimensional entity. However, the JSA were able to fend off the Society, including killing the Rival and Black Adam defecting, with the fight culminating in the Flash drawing on Black Adam's speed to send the King of Tears to another dimension by striking him at near-lightspeed.


==== Wizard's Second Injustice Society ====
The demon Legacy (actually Wizard in disguise) formed another version in the JSA All-Stars mini-series. The lineup consists of Icicle, Rival, Shiv, and Tigress. The new team again confronted the JSA. Unknown to the JSA, their job was just to stick teleportation disks to the old-timers. Legacy then teleported his successful team away. Legacy is then later "killed" by the Spectre.


==== Injustice Society ====
The Injustice Society resurfaced again in November 2005, in the pages of JSA Classified. The soul of Wizard joined forces with Johnny Sorrow where they gathered a new incarnation of the Injustice Society consisting of Gentleman Ghost, Icicle, Rag Doll, Solomon Grundy, the Thinker A.I., and Tigress III. They were tasked to steal Prometheus' Cosmic Key from the JSA Headquarters in order to free Wizard and Johnny Sorrow. While noting to himself that Rag Doll would betray the group, Wizard sets him up to take the fall. The Injustice Society tried to enlist the Secret Society of Super Villains to help with the caper which drew the attention of Talia al Ghul. Rag Doll took the Cosmic Key as Wizard predicted and was killed when he activated the Cosmic Key. Once Johnny Sorrow was brought back to Earth, he and the Injustice Society teleported to Prometheus' Crooked House. When it was discovered that Tigress III and Icicle started falling in love with each other, Johnny Sorrow strong-armed them into sticking around.Another plot was to kidnap Stargirl and to face off against the JSA All Stars.
