The original Sargon first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[All-American Comics]]&#39;&#39; #26, (May 1941), and was created by [[John B. Wentworth]] and [[Howard Purcell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character continued in &#39;&#39;All-American Comics&#39;&#39; until issue #50 (June 1943), and then moved to &#39;&#39;[[Comic Cavalcade]]&#39;&#39; (1943-1946) and &#39;&#39;[[Sensation Comics]]&#39;&#39; (1946-1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Roy |title=The All-Star Companion: Vol 2 |date=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1893905375 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe modern Sargon first appears in &#39;&#39;[[Doctor Fate|Helmet of Fate: Sargon]]&#39;&#39; #1 (April 2007) and was created by [[Steve Niles]] and [[Scott Hampton]]. The name Sargon is of [[Mesopotamian]] origin, and one king of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] and two of [[Assyria]] bore this name.\n\nSargon appeared in [[Live action|live-action]] in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39;, portrayed by Ra\u00fal Herrera.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===John Sargent===\n&#39;&#39;&#39;Sargon&#39;&#39;&#39; debuted in &#39;&#39;[[All-American Comics]]&#39;&#39; #26, with a publication date of May 1941. He was a stage magician, dressed like a [[swami]] complete with [[turban]], to disguise the fact that he wielded true mystical powers, passing off such feats as [[illusion]]s.  As a child, he came into possession of the mystic Ruby of Life which allowed him to control anything he touches (touching the ground lets him erect a wall, for instance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/sargon.htm |title=Sargon the Sorceror}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTaking his professional name from the [[Sargon of Akkad|ancient king]] of the same name, Sargon has had a checkered career, acting mostly as a hero during the [[Golden Age (comics)|Golden Age]] aided by his cartoonish fat little [[comic relief]] [[sidekick]] / manager Maximillian O&#39;Leary as he battled crooks, spies and his azure-skinned archenemy the Blue Lama, the Queen of [[Black Magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |pages=231-232}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHe re-emerges in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] \u2013 as a villain, at least at first. It was later explained that his villainous activities were the result of certain side effects of possessing the Ruby of Life. He was brought back for occasional guest appearances in the [[Silver Age (comics)|Silver Age]] and was awarded with an honorary membership in the [[Justice League]] in &#39;&#39;Justice League of America&#39;&#39; #99 in 1972. Sargon later explained that he moved from his home of [[Earth-Two]] to take up residence on [[Earth-One]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League of America&#39;&#39; #220 (Nov. 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Image:Sargondcu1.jpg|thumb|left|130px|The original Sargon the Sorcerer by artist [[Howard Purcell]]]]\nSargon maintained contacts with several other mages in the DC Universe, notably [[Night Force|Baron Winters]], [[Zatara]] (a fellow &#39;&#39;faux&#39;&#39; stage magician), and the younger mage [[John Constantine]]. Sargon answered the summons of Constantine to participate in a ritual at the mansion of Winters to help deal with the effects of the &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39;, using the [[Swamp Thing]] as their portal into the war being fought in [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]].  Locking hands in a circle of power, and using the psychic powers of Constantine&#39;s drunken acquaintance [[Mento (comics)|Mento]], the group of sorcerers (which also included Zatara&#39;s daughter [[Zatanna]]) observed the events unfolding, and attempted in turn to channel their magical powers into several other mystical characters present in Hell, including [[Etrigan]], the original [[Doctor Fate]], and the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]].\n\nTheir enemy, a primal form of evil (called the [[Great Evil Beast]]) that was surging upwards to obliterate everything in its path, sensed their interference and lashed out several times; its power raced around the circle, finding a weak link and incinerating it. The first to fall was Sargon. At first panicking and crying out for the others to help him, and almost pulling his hands away from the circle, Sargon was rebuked by Zatara to maintain his composure and die like a sorcerer. In a final act of will, Sargon apologized for his outburst, calmly sat in place and was burned alive without a whimper, never letting go of his colleagues&#39; hands the entire time. This ritual also kills Zatara and drives Mento completely insane.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Swamp Thing&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #49-50 (June-July 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSargon would later return in &#39;&#39;[[Swamp Thing]]&#39;&#39;, \&quot;borrowing\&quot; the body of an elderly German man named Koestler and planning to lead the souls trapped in Hell in an assault on Heaven. He sacrificed this form to save his niece, Gracie Brody.\n\nDuring the &#39;&#39;[[Books of Magic]]&#39;&#39; series, the [[Phantom Stranger]] and young [[Timothy Hunter]] had a brief encounter with what was apparently Sargon&#39;s soul, who attempted to warn the boy of the dangers and costs of pursuing magical power. He then disintegrated right before their eyes, leaving behind his Ruby of Life.\n\nSargon appears in the &#39;&#39;[[Day of Judgement (comics)|Day of Judgement]]&#39;&#39; series as a gray soul in the realm of Purgatory. He presumably joins in the fight against the guardians of Purgatory when a team of living heroes arrives to bring back the soul of Hal Jordan.\n\n===David John Sargent===\nThe &#39;&#39;[[Doctor Fate|Helmet of Fate]]&#39;&#39; miniseries featured a &#39;&#39;Sargon the Sorcerer&#39;&#39; one-shot, starring his successor &#39;&#39;&#39;David John Sargent&#39;&#39;&#39;.\n\nAfter dropping out of college, having at least seven relationships, and a brief stint as the lead singer in a band, David spent the rest of his life as a drifter on the side of the road. One day two men who claimed to represent the estate of his grandfather, the original Sargon, found David and told him that he was his heir. Actually, these men were demons trying to find Sargon&#39;s Ruby of Life, but could not do so because of the protection spells he had placed on his house.\n\nDavid was tricked into signing away his grandfather&#39;s estate over to the two men, who then prepared to force him to find the Ruby when the Helmet of Fate suddenly appeared. David escaped the two and was led into his grandfather&#39;s secret attic by Sargon&#39;s ghost. Searching around, he found his grandfather&#39;s old props, his suit and turban, which contained some pieces of the Ruby. Those pieces then went into David&#39;s chest; through them Sargon was able to project himself in front of his grandson. He explained to David that he needed a successor to his name to find the remaining pieces of the Ruby, which had somehow shattered, and he was the only member of his bloodline still alive. He also explained that he pulled the Helmet off its course in order to provide a distraction long enough to grant David the Ruby&#39;s power.\n\nDavid accepted the role of Sargon the Sorcerer, and armed with new mystical abilities, went to drive the two men from his home. At the time, the two used a piece of the Ruby they acquired to turn themselves into demons, and managed to weaken the Helmet. David then quickly disposed of the two, and sent the Helmet back on its course after placing a piece of himself into it.\n\nDavid went on to play a part in &#39;&#39;[[Reign in Hell]]&#39;&#39;, assisting [[Zatanna]] and [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]], and ultimately sacrificing himself to Lobo&#39;s mercy to allow many heroes and anti-heroes out of Hell; this event left Zatanna and Blue Devil traumatized, as they were the ones who went to Sargon for help in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Blaze and Satanus|DC Universe Special: Reign in Hell]]&#39;&#39; #1 (August 2008) and &#39;&#39;Reign In Hell&#39;&#39; #1\u20138 (September 2008 \u2013 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The New 52===\nIn 2011, DC Comics rebooted the DC universe in \&quot;[[The New 52]].\&quot; Sargon appears briefly in &#39;&#39;Justice League Dark&#39;&#39;, where he is mentioned as one of the great magicians of the past age, among peers such as Zatara and Dr. Occult. In &#39;&#39;Constantine&#39;&#39; #1, Sargon is revealed to have been one of four powerful magicians who became corrupted by their power and formed the villainous cult known as the Cold Flame.  He is shown to have died some time prior, and his daughter has taken on his powers and role in the group, under the name Sargon the Sorceress.\n\n==In other media==\nSargon the Sorcerer was mentioned on the &#39;&#39;[[DC Super Hero Girls]]&#39;&#39; short \&quot;Vanity Insanity\&quot;. Jessica Cruz implied to Zatanna that meeting him was the most important day of her life. \n\nSargon the Sorcerer makes a cameo appearance in the fifth part of the &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; crossover event, portrayed by Ra\u00fal Herrera. He attempted to rob a bank while using an illusion of a giant Beebo toy as a diversion. When [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], [[Batwoman]], [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], and [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] fought it, they discovered it was not real. Sara and Flash later tracked down Sargon and knocked him out, causing his illusion to disappear.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.toonopedia.com/sargon.htm Sargon the Sorcerer] at [[Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia]].
