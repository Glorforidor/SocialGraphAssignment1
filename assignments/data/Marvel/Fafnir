The character did not feature again in Marvel continuity until ''Thor'' #318 (April 1982), and was finally killed in a storyline in ''Thor'' #341-343 (March\u2013May 1984). Fafnir returned from the dead (referred to as King Fafnir of Nastrond) in Thor #486-488 (May\u2013July 1995).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nFafnir is first encountered in the guise of an old man by the warrior [[Volstagg]], who with his companions is currently exploring the ruined realm of Nastrond, an extradimensional realm on the continent of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. Fafnir explains he was the [[King]] of Nastrond, and that the King of the Norse Gods [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] destroyed Nastrond due to the evil nature of its people. Fafnir himself was left to die in a ruined wasteland, but survives by drinking from a pool of water with [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al properties. The water, however, transforms Fafnir into a massive [[dragon]]. Knowing that Volstagg and his allies were sent by Odin, Fafnir uses the power of illusion and intends to devour the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]]. Odin's son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], however, defeats Fafnir by driving the dragon into a [[chasm]] using his lightning, after which he frees Volstagg.<ref>''Thor'' #134-135 (Nov.-Dec. 1966)</ref>\n\nFafnir reappears when Thor's stepbrother and perennial foe [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] sends the dragon to Earth to kill the Thunder God. Thor, however, uses his mystical hammer ''[[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]]'' to hold Fafnir at bay until Odin intervenes and banishes the former king back to the ruins of Nastrond.<ref>''Thor'' #318 (April 1982)</ref> Fafnir eventually returns to Earth, destroys several abandoned buildings in New York City and battles the National Guard. Thor and Elif, the elderly chief and last survivor of a lost Viking colony armed with a spear blessed by Odin himself, arrive to battle. They are almost defeated, but Elif gives up his life to drive the spear into Fafnir, and Thor hammers it in all the way, slaying Fafnir. Thor gives Elif a noble Viking funeral by burning Fafnir's body atop his corpse.<ref>''Thor'' #341-343 (March\u2013May 1984)</ref>\n\nFafnir was released from [[Hel (location)|Hel]] alongside the [[Midgard Serpent]], Fafnir of [[Jotunheim]] (a frost giant), [[Nidhogg]], Farsung the Enchanter, an [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Ice Giant]] and two Ice Dwarves by [[Kurse]] to battle Thor and [[Sif (comics)|Lady Sif]]. The threat of these entities is stopped when Thor agrees to go to Hel's realm willingly.<ref>''Thor'' #486-488 (May\u2013July 1995)</ref>\n\nFafnir later reappears in the 2011 limited series ''Avengers Prime'' in the aftermath of the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline as, at first, an adversary then ally of Thor, [[Iron Man (comics)|Tony Stark]] and [[Captain America (comics)|Steve Rogers]] with several legions of ogres and elves in battle against a Twilight Sword wielding Hela and her army.<ref>''Avengers Prime'' #1-5 (November 2010 - March 2011)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nFafnir was originally a normal man until transformed by the properties of a magical pool into a large dragon. Fafnir retains his intellect and speech, possesses superhuman strength and durability, and the ability to breathe fire and cast [[illusion]]s.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Fafnir of Jotunheim===\nAnother Fafnir appeared in the Marvel Universe. He is a [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giant]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.immortalthor.net/bio-giantsofjotunheim.html#Fafnir |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221215543/http://www.immortalthor.net/bio-giantsofjotunheim.html#Fafnir |archive-date=2011-02-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Brother to [[Fasolt]] and enemy of Thor, he first appeared in 1980 in ''Thor'' #294.\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn ''[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]] #13'', Thor briefly mentions Fafnir, when he teleports a [[Chitauri]] bomb to the wastes of Nastrond, which is home to only Fafnir the Dragon.<ref>''The Ultimates'' #13</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Fafnir appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode \"A Friend in Need\".
