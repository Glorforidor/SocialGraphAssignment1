The original team was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]], and derived from the previously created supervillain team [[Squadron Sinister]].\n\nThe core members of the Squadron Supreme are [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], [[Nighthawk (Squadron Supreme)|Nighthawk]], [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]], [[Power Princess]], and the [[Whizzer (Stanley Stewart)|Whizzer]]. The team also has several minor members. Members of the team are based on characters published by rival [[DC Comics]], and the team is a stand-in for the [[Justice League]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Eury\&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |title=The Justice League Companion: A Historical and Speculative Overview of the Silver Age Justice League of America |date=2005 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |isbn=9781893905481 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QxJPl_R0FtwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 8, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}} A number of characters that were not based on DC heroes were later added to the roster.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Squadron Supreme has its roots in the [[Squadron Sinister]], which first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]&#39;&#39; #70 as a pastiche of the Justice League.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Eury\&quot;/&gt;{{rp|40}} [[Roy Thomas]] later introduced a heroic version of the Squadron Sinister named the Squadron Supreme, which first appeared in &#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; #85\u201386 (February\u2013March 1971), and which was co-created with [[John Buscema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=[[DK (publisher)|DK]] |isbn=9781465455505 |page=148 |edition=Updated and expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team then had guest appearances on several more occasions, and in 1985 was featured in a self-titled twelve-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] by [[Mark Gruenwald]].\n\nIn 2003, a reimagined Squadron Supreme appeared in an ongoing series entitled &#39;&#39;Supreme Power&#39;&#39;, published under the mature-audience [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint. This version was created by writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and artist [[Gary Frank]].\n\nYet another Squadron Supreme was introduced in 2015, written by [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] and drawn by [[Leonard Kirk]]. Unlike the previous teams, which had appeared in alternate realities, this team was based in Marvel&#39;s main \&quot;Earth-616\&quot; reality, although the team members were from a variety of alternate universes that had been destroyed in the aftermath of the 2015 &#39;&#39;[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]&#39;&#39; event.\n\n==Fictional team biography==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=April 2020}}\n===Earth-712 version===\nThe Squadron Supreme are first encountered by four members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] \u2014 the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Goliath]] \u2014 who have arrived in the Earth-712 universe by mistake.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; #84 (January 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; The Avengers are initially confused, since several members of the Squadron Supreme have identical names and powers to the [[Squadron Sinister]], a group of previously encountered villains.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; #69\u201370 (October\u2013November 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief battle, the Avengers assist the Squadron Supreme against the global threat posed by the mutant [[Brain-Child]], before returning to their own universe.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; #85\u201386 (Feb\u2013Mar 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; The Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the &#39;&#39;&#39;Serpent Cartel&#39;&#39;&#39;, but eventually they join forces and prevent the use of the [[Serpent Crown]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; #141\u2013144 (November 1975 \u2013 February 1976) &amp; #147\u2013149 (May\u2013July 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe team features briefly in the title &#39;&#39;[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]&#39;&#39;, when the evil version of [[Hyperion (Zhib-Ran)|Hyperion]] attacks the Earth-712 version and then the Earth-616 Thor.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thor&#39;&#39; #280 (February 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; The Squadron appear in the title &#39;&#39;[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]&#39;&#39; as mind-controlled pawns of the entities the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]] and [[Null (comics)|Null the Living Darkness]], but are freed and aid the Defenders in defeating the villains.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Defenders&#39;&#39; #112\u2013114 (October\u2013December 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Earth-712, however, is left in a [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] state.{{issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe Squadron Supreme were next featured in a self-titled 12-issue [[miniseries]] (Sep 1985 \u2013 Aug 1986) by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]],&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme&#39;&#39; #1\u201312 (Sep 1985 \u2013 Aug 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; which picks up from where Earth-712 was last seen in &#39;&#39;Defenders&#39;&#39; #114. The Squadron, led by Hyperion, believe they have the knowledge and power to recreate the world and create a [[utopia]]. Nighthawk protests, believing that the Squadron should serve and not rule. The issue is put to a vote, with the so-called \&quot;Utopia Program\&quot; favored by the majority of the Squadron; Nighthawk, unable to agree with the decision in clear conscience, resigns from the team. The Squadron assume overall control of the government of the [[United States]] and remake the nation into a virtual utopia. The team implement a series of sweeping changes, including revealing their secret identities; instituting a program of [[behavior modification]] in prisons where inmates are forced to submit to a process that mentally inhibits their criminal instincts; enforcing a strict gun control policy; and developing medical technology to cryogenically preserve the dead.{{issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nDespite the economic and technological advances, there are setbacks: [[Golden Archer]] abuses the behavior modification technology by forcing fellow member [[Lady Lark]] to love him,{{issue|date=September 2020}} resulting in his eventual removal from the team;{{issue|date=September 2020}} [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] becomes increasingly disgusted with the Squadron&#39;s methods and abandons the surface world altogether;{{issue|date=September 2020}} [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]] inadvertently kills his parents via unnoticed and uncontrollable release of radiation and dies while battling Doctor Spectrum during a rampage;{{issue|date=September 2020}} and [[Tom Thumb (comics)|Tom Thumb]] discovers he has [[cancer]] but chooses not to inform his teammates, eventually succumbing to the disease.{{issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nAt one point, the team is attacked by the Institute of Evil.{{issue|date=September 2020}} The Squadron ultimately defeats the Institute and uses the behavior modification technology to reform them, adding the former supervillains as members.{{issue|date=September 2020}} Three of them die or are incapacitated.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\n\nIn the meantime Nighthawk forms a new team he calls the America Redeemers, recruiting former villains and several previously unknown superhumans.{{issue|date=September 2020}} The later infiltrate the Squadron and kidnap the surviving Institute members to reverse the behavior modification on them.{{issue|date=September 2020}} Despite mixed feelings on the parts of several of the Institute members, they too join the Redeemers.{{issue|date=September 2020}} Former Squadron member Golden Archer (now known as Black Archer) also joins.{{issue|date=September 2020}}\n\nEventually, the Redeemers confront the Squadron Supreme. A brutal battle ensues in which several members of both teams are killed, including Nighthawk. A horrified Hyperion realizes that Nighthawk was right: the Squadron, despite having good intentions, had inadvertently created a totalitarian state, with themselves as its dictators. The Squadron surrenders, disbands, and returns control of the United States to the government.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme&#39;&#39; #12. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn a [[graphic novel]] sequel by Gruenwald, Ryan, and [[inker]] [[Al Williamson]], &#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe&#39;&#39;, remnants of the team reunite to battle the [[Nth Man]]. Although they succeed, several members of the Squadron are killed, with the remainder (Hyperion, [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]], [[Whizzer (Stanley Stewart)|Whizzer]], [[Power Princess]], [[Lady Lark]] (now known as Skylark), [[Arcanna]], [[Haywire (comics)|Haywire]], and [[Shape (comics)|Shape]]) [[Marooning|marooned]] in the mainstream Marvel universe.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe&#39;&#39; (1989).

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Squadron come into conflict with a new government when an [[Interdimensional being|interdimensional]] team called the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], traveling from the Earth-616 universe, reveal that the government had rigged the election through worldwide vote [[fraud]]. The Squadron and the Exiles depose the new government and attempt to allow society to progress without superhuman involvement.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Exiles&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #77\u201378 (Apr\u2013May 2006). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;Supreme Power&#39;&#39;===\nThe series &#39;&#39;Supreme Power&#39;&#39; features the [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] version of the [[superhero]] team Squadron Supreme and is set on Earth-31916.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Supreme Power&#39;&#39; #1\u201318 (Jan. 2003 \u2013 Oct. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAlien [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]] arrives on Earth as an infant, and is taken into custody by the [[US government]] and raised in a controlled environment. Army [[corporal]] Joseph Ledger is given a strange crystal removed from Hyperion&#39;s spaceship by the government that bonds to him causing him to fall into a [[coma]] for years.\n\nDiscovering Hyperion has superhuman abilities, the government uses him as a secret weapon, and is eventually outed by the [[News media|media]]. The government then announces and introduces Hyperion as a state-sponsored hero, which encourages other beings to appear, such as [[The Atlanta Blur|Blur]], who can move at superspeed. Ledger awakens, and, harnessing the energy powers of the crystal, becomes [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-31916)|Doctor Spectrum]]. Hyperion and Spectrum are initially hostile to one another, and they battle, with Hyperion accessing lost memories when coming in contact with Spectrum&#39;s crystal. [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] is seen on dry land for the first time, and [[Power Princess|Princess Zarda]] heals Hyperion after his battle. [[Nighthawk (Supreme Power)|Nighthawk]] solicits the aid of Hyperion and the Blur to deal with a superpowered [[serial killer]], who Hyperion now knows is actually the product of experimentation with his [[DNA]].\n\nAlthough successful, Hyperion is outraged by the government exploitation and leaves, warning that he has no wish to be contacted by humankind again. The government gathers the remaining superhumans into a team to capture Hyperion.\n\nThe story continues in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] &#39;&#39;Supreme Power: Hyperion&#39;&#39;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Supreme Power: Hyperion&#39;&#39; #1\u20135 (Nov. 2005 \u2013 Mar. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; with new Squadron members [[Master Menace|Emil Burbank]], [[Arcanna]], [[Shape (comics)|Shape]] and [[Nuke (Squadron Supreme)|Nuke]] tracking Hyperion to what they believe is an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]]. In this world, Hyperion and a version of the Squadron rule the world, with only Nighthawk and a small group of superhumans opposing their rule. Although the heroes locate the true Hyperion and convince him to return to their world, Burbank discovers that it was in fact not an alternate reality but their world two years from the present time.\n\n===Second &#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme&#39;&#39; title===\nThe second volume of the series &#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme&#39;&#39;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #1\u20137 (May \u2013 Nov. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; brings together all the superhumans (except a reluctant Nighthawk), who are split into two teams\u2014one for international/public missions and another for covert operations. The [[President of the United States]] calls the group the Squadron Supreme. The Squadron meets with mixed success: an attempt to kill an [[Africa]]n [[dictator]] is botched, and the target is murdered by local superhumans who state the group is not welcome in Africa, and a mission to [[Iran]] has member [[Inertia (comics)|Inertia]] encouraging a victim to fight back and kill.\n\n[[China]] recruits [[Redstone (comics)|Redstone]], the superpowered serial killer created from Hyperion&#39;s DNA, in a bid to protect itself. The final issue is a battle to the death against Redstone (with the Blur recruiting Nighthawk to assist) who threatens to [[detonate]] a [[nuclear weapon]]. The outcome is not revealed, as the series concluded with issue #7.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Ultimate Power&#39;&#39;===\nAn unrelated nine-issue series, &#39;&#39;[[Ultimate Power]]&#39;&#39;, written by J. Michael Straczynski; [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Jeph Loeb]] with art by [[Greg Land]],&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Power&#39;&#39; #1\u20133 (Dec. 2006 \u2013 Feb. 2007); #4\u20135 (June\u2013July 2007); #6\u20137 (Sep.\u2013Oct. 2007); #8 (Dec. 2007) and #9 (Feb. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; features the Squadron in a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] into the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. Courtesy of a deception engineered by [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] and the Ultimate villain [[Doctor Doom]], the Squadron travel to the Ultimate universe, thinking that the Ultimate [[Reed Richards]] is responsible for releasing an organism that has destroyed much of the United States.\n\nA series of misunderstandings ensues, and after a series of battles between the Squadron, [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]], [[Ultimates]] and the [[Earth-712]] Squadron Supreme (whose world was also affected by the organism), the third culprit is revealed as Burbank, who was asked by the government to develop a weapon to kill Hyperion. Nick Fury is detained in custody in the Earth-31916 universe, while Squadron member Power Princess remains in the Ultimate universe to ensure that Doom (who escaped custody by using a [[Doombot]]) is captured.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk&#39;&#39;===\nAn unrelated four-issue limited series, &#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk&#39;&#39;, written by [[Marc Guggenheim]] and with art by [[Paul Gulacy]], relates how Hyperion and Nighthawk, after an initial skirmish, join forces to try and alleviate the [[Darfur conflict]] in war-torn [[Sudan]]. Hyperion discovers Nighthawk has a [[prototype]] weapon built from stolen plans of Emil Burbank&#39;s journal that cannot actually injure him, but can convince him that he is being injured.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme: Hyperion vs. Nighthawk&#39;&#39; #1\u20134 (March\u2013June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Third &#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme&#39;&#39; title===\nA third volume of the title &#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme&#39;&#39;, written by [[Howard Chaykin]] and with art by [[Greg Land]] (and other artists), is published,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #1\u201312 (Sep. 2008 \u2013 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; with the 12-issue series being set five years after the battle with Redstone. Most of the Squadron have disappeared, with Ultimate Nick Fury, Burbank and Arcanna now a team of intelligence officers working for the government and investigating a group of returning astronauts that exhibit strange abilities. The astronauts [[infect]] many people they come into contact with, also giving them superhuman abilities.\n\nFury eventually leads a new version of the Squadron that features characters who are [[pastiche]]s of long-time Marvel characters. The group eventually come into conflict with many of the original members of the Squadron who have been gathered by Hyperion. The heroes unite to stop a group of superhuman [[terrorist]]s from the [[Middle East]], but then, via a government device, apparently all lose their abilities. Arcanna secretly reveals to Fury that she, and likely many others, still possesses superhuman abilities. Fury later returns to the Ultimate universe.\n\n===Later appearances===\nLater, the members of Squadron Supreme are apparently killed by [[Namor]] and the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] after the villains raid the Squadron&#39;s universe.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;New Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #24&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2019}} Versions resembling these characters later appear on the [[Battleworld]] created by Doctor Doom during the [[Secret Wars]] event, only to be killed again at the hands of [[Squadron Sinister]].

They decide to change the past by dragging this past Namor back to the present, thereby resurrecting him. Although this action is easy for Hyperion, who has had second thoughts about the cutthroat methods the Squadron Supreme has been using, it is more difficult for Doctor Spectrum, as Namor destroyed her Earth. At the end of the story arc, Hyperion leads the action to disband the Squadron, and the team goes their separate ways.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Squadron Supreme&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #13\u201315.

Before they can grab him, Black Panther contacts [[Broo (comics)|Broo]] to teleport him away. As he disappears, Black Panther states that Phil Coulson won&#39;t answer their questions and that the Avengers aren&#39;t their enemies unless they forced them to be.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 8) #21.
