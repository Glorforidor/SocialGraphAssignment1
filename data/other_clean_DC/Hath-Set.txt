Hath-Set led it into war against the other tribes including the Bird Tribe. The Judas Tribe caused this woar to bring Barbatos to Earth.

Using Nth Metal from a crashed Thanagarian ship, Hath-Set killed Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara.

Hath-Set appears in Justice League Unlimited, voiced by HÃ©ctor Elizondo. This interpretation is a loyal subject of the Hawks. In the episode "Ancient History", he sees Hawkman (Katar Hol) seeing Hawkgirl (Chay-Ara) kissing top military general Bashari. When Hawkman wishes "[the two] were dead", Hath-Set takes this as an order and poisons Hawkgirl and Bashari. Hawkman discovers what Hath-Set has done, ordering Hath-Set to get out before Hawkman commits suicide by drinking Hath-Set's poisoned wine.
Hath-Set appears in the Arrowverse, portrayed by Casper Crump. He was an ancient Egyptian priest in the service of Ramesses II who became ambitious and desired power for himself. He was also in love with the priestess Chay-Ara, who only had eyes for Prince Khufu, and Hath-Set learned of this and was consumed with a jealous rage. After Hath-Set attempted to murder the lovers, all three were exposed to a mutative element during a meteor shower (which was actually a product of futuristic technology from the planet Thanagar); Chay-Ara and Khufu were reincarnated each time the two died while Hath-Set developed the power of immortality,which he would need to maintain by killing both the priestess and prince in each lifetime they lived. At some point, Hath-Set assumed the name of "Vandal Savage" and began his lifelong quest to kill each of his enemies' incarnations in each lifetime, managing to do so 206 times over the next 4000 years to maintain his own immortality. Hath-Set became more ambitious and sought not to only rule Egypt but the entire world, and over the course of time gradually began to manipulate world leaders into starting wars to prime the world for his own eventual rule. Hath-Set succeeds in conquering the world by 2166 which leads to Time Master Rip Hunter assembling a team to stop his reign of terror before Hath-Set's mechanizations begins. When he attempts to reset the timeline, he temporarily renders himself mortal and is killed by the renegade team of time-travelers.
