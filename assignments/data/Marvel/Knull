The character is depicted as an evil [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|deity]], who created the weapon known as All-Black the Necrosword and the alien races known as the [[Klyntar]] and Exolons. The character would go on to play a more important role in the [[Marvel Universe]].{{clarify|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character was first introduced in ''Venom'' #3 (Aug 2018), giving a nod to a nameless being appearing in ''Thor: God of Thunder'' #6.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=205}}</ref> The character would be mentioned in various issues of ''[[Venom (comic book)|Web of Venom]]'', ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and \"[[War of the Realms]]\".\n\nAfter that, Knull was revealed to be the antagonist in Donny Cates\u2019 ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]: Black'' #1.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nKnull is a primordial deity, created when the First Firmament was shattered into pieces and forced to flee in terror, and was originally content to drift through the endless void of space created by the shattered pieces, until the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] arrived and began creating the 7th iteration of the Marvel Universe. Awakened by the \"Light of the Creation\" and outraged by his kingdom of darkness being despoiled, Knull retaliated by creating All-Black the Necrosword and killing one of the Celestials. Seeing this, the other Celestials banished Knull and the severed head deeper into the Void. He then used the head to forge the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] and combined it with the cosmic energies of the head, which would eventually become [[Knowhere]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1022604840051109888|title = Yep!

He created a symbiote armor and, with All-Black, started killing the other [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|deities]], until he crash landed on an unnamed planet where [[Gorr the God Butcher|Gorr]] took All-Black and incapacitated Knull.<ref>''Thor God of Thunder'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Knull eventually reawakened and discovered he could bond his living abyss to \"lesser creatures\" and control their new form as vessels. He created an army of symbiotes with himself in the center of the hive mind and uses them to spread over the universe, establishing the Symbiote Imperium and killing the light and creation in the process.\n\nHe continued killing Gods, while also enslaving others whom he spared with the use of his abyss. At some point, he was approached by the time displaced [[Silver Surfer]], who had been weakened after the Surfer had created a little star in order to free a world from Knull's control. After a brief fight, Knull was able to bond a symbiote to the Surfer, but the latter was saved by [[Ego, the Living Planet]].<ref>''Silver Surfer: Black'' #1-2. Marvel Comics</ref> When Knull reached the Surfer, he tried to defeat him and re-infect the Surfer with his abyss, but the Surfer, who had gathered the energy of the cosmos, creates a star which was enough to defeat Knull.<ref>''Silver Surfer: Black'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen one dragon-like symbiote composite arrived on medieval Earth to claim the planet as part of the Symbiote Imperium, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] arrived in aid of the Viking villagers and defeated the dragon, which the villagers called \"Grendel\", causing the connection between Knull and the symbiote hivemind to break. The symbiotes that were scattered over the universe, now free from Knull's control, began bonding to benevolent hosts and learning about the [[Divine light|Light]]. The Symbiotes rebelled against their god and trapped him inside an artificial planet formed of thousands of symbiotes, which they called Klyntar \u2014 \"cage\" in their language.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter thousands of years,  [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] discovered the body of the Grendel and bound the pieces of the dragon to soldiers in order to create Super-Soldiers to fight in the [[Vietnam War]]. The procedure was dubbed the [[Weapon Plus#Weapon V|Sym-Soldier program]]. This reawakened Knull, allowing him to take control of the Sym-soldiers who went rogue before being captured by [[Nick Fury]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]], except one piece, named Rex, which escaped Knull's control.<ref>''Web of Venom Ve'nam'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Years later, [[Eddie Brock]] ([[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]) unknowingly freed the dragon and, after a battle against Eddie and [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]], the dragon began searching for Rex in order to free Knull.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Venom merged with Rex and eventually trapped the Grendel in a blast furnace, incinerating it and Rex both.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #5-6.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn ''Carnage Born'', after [[Scorn (Marvel Comics)|Scorn]] formed a cult worshiping Knull, they stole the codices of Grendel and Cletus' damaged body and, after implanting the codices inside Cletus, the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage symbiote]]'s codex is absorbed by Grendel, causing Grendel to become god-like. After the contact with Knull, Cletus decided to free Knull by collecting every codex of every host who had at some point bonded to symbiotes in order to overload the symbiote hive mind and scatter the Klyntar.<ref>''Web of Venom Carnage Born'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIt's also revealed that Knull had created the Exolons\u2014parasites that attach to a host while feeding on their soul. [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Zak-Del]], whose body houses Exolon, plans to find Knull in order for the latter to remove the parasite from him.<ref>''Guardians of Galaxy'' Vol 5 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter Cletus reunited with [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]], they reformed the cult dedicated in worshiping Knull and returned to Doverton, Colorado, where they got the codices from the citizens and animals who were infected by Carnage during ''Carnage USA''.<ref>''Web of Venom Cult of Carnage'' #1.

Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''Absolute Carnage: Scream'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> Knull was finally reawakened after Dark Carnage tricked Eddie into killing him after claiming the remaining codices.

He possesses Supreme Umbrakinesis, as he can manifest darkness to create weapons and creatures, whom he calls the \"Living Abyss\", which he can control and also augment their power which allowed Venom to unlock new abilities and also allowed one of Knull's dragon to be unaffected by the symbiotes' classic weaknesses and to be as fast as the Silver Surfer. He also possesses limited shapeshifting ability, including the ability to turn his human-like mouth into fanged jaws with an elongated tongue \u2014 this feature was passed on to the symbiotes. He's also an expert combatant, utilizing All-Black to kill [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] and other [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|gods]], while wearing an armor made from symbiote with a red dragon and spiral emblem, which was based on Spiral of [[Carcosa]] from the ''[[True Detective]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stegmanandfriends.podbean.com/e/venom-boiz-wdonny-cates-venom-1-q-and-a//|title=VENOM BOIZ! w/Donny Cates: Venom (2018) #1 Director\u2019s Commentary|date=22 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nDespite his connection to the symbiotes being severed, his influence can still be seen such when Gorr, [[Galactus#King Thor|Old Galactus]],<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' #24.
