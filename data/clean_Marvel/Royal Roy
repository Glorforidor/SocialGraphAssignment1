It was created by Lennie Herman and Warren Kremer.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nRoyal Roy began in April 1985 as an answer to the successful Harvey Comics Richie Rich series.  Its title character was the young Prince Roy of Cashelot, a fictional kingdom whose name was a portmanteau of \"cash\" and \"Camelot\".  Like Richie, Roy was surrounded by wealth and luxury, but wasn't spoiled by it; in many ways, he was just like any other young boy. Also like Richie, Roy had a sweet-natured middle-class girlfriend (Crystal Cleer) and a wealthy, abrasive acquaintance (Lorna Loot) who vied for his affections.\nIn late 1985 Harvey Comics sued Star Comics for copyright infringement, claiming that Royal Roy was a blatant copy of Richie Rich. (Longtime Harvey creator Lennie Herman had created Royal Roy for Star Comics; Herman died in 1983 before the first issue of Royal Roy was published.)\nRoyal Roy was cancelled after six issues in March 1986, and Harvey's lawsuit was dropped.\n\n\n=== X-Babies ===\nAn updated version of Royal Roy (along with Planet Terry, Top Dog and Wally the Wizard) is featured in the four-issue X-Babies miniseries published by Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoyal Roy at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.
