Premiering on September 9, 1967, this 60-minute program included a series of six-minute adventures featuring various [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Hal |title=Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 Through 2003 |date=2005 |edition=2nd |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co |isbn=978-1476665993 |pages=812-813}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Overview==\nEach episode consisted of new segments from the existing series, &#39;&#39;[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[The Adventures of Superboy (TV series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]&#39;&#39;, as well as outings for [[Aquaman]] and his sidekick [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]]. Superman fans generally regard it as the second season of &#39;&#39;The New Adventures&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=episode-guides/t-tnaos |title=&#39;&#39;The New Adventures of Superman&#39;&#39;: Episode List |website=SupermanHomepage.com|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of &#39;&#39;The New Adventures&#39;&#39;, it is notable for containing some of the final work done by [[Bud Collyer]], the voice actor who had originated the roles of Superman and Clark Kent on [[radio drama|radio]]. It also included a rotating series of \&quot;guest star\&quot; cartoons featuring the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], the [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Hawkman]] and new shorts from &#39;&#39;[[The Adventures of Superboy (TV series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]&#39;&#39;. The [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] (Atom, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Aquaman and Superman) and [[Teen Titans]] ([[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], Kid Flash, [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]], and Aqualad, but not [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]) were also featured in team adventures.\n\nMany of the shorts were penned and script-edited by [[DC Comics]] employees. [[Bob Haney]] and [[George Kashdan]] \u2014 the writing-editing team who were then producing the original version of the &#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; comic book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=17734 |title=&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; #1: Credits |publisher=ComicbookDb.com |date= |accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; \u2014 were prolific on the series, taking on nearly all the \&quot;guest star\&quot; cartoons. [[Mort Weisinger]], editor of all &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; comic titles during the 1960s, served as script editor for the shorts featuring Kal-El. This use of comic writers on the television series tended to make them \&quot;a very faithful adaption to the comic book mythos.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;tower\&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanstower.com/source/theater/filmation.html|title=Animated Titans: Filmation|publisher=TitansTower.com|accessdate=January 30, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030102185312/http://www.titanstower.com/source/theater/filmation.html|archivedate=January 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even so, there were some elements which were unique to the cartoons, such as secondary characters in the &#39;&#39;Hawkman&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Atom&#39;&#39; shorts.\n\nThis series marked the animation debut of nearly all of its featured characters and teams. The exceptions were Superman and his supporting cast, who had been previously immortalized in the iconic [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|1940s Superman shorts]] (and later in &#39;&#39;The New Adventures of Superman&#39;&#39;), and the Superboy characters, seen in the previous season of &#39;&#39;The Adventures of Superboy&#39;&#39;.\n\n==Legacy==\nDue to the success of the show, Filmation had produced a [[Metamorpho]] pilot and planned pilots for [[Plastic Man]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. A DC Comics cartoon hour was also being developed, with concept drawings featuring Metamorpho, Plastic Man, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|The Blackhawks]], the [[Doom Patrol]], [[B&#39;wana Beast]] and the [[Metal Men]]. Plans were cancelled when CBS secured the animation rights to [[Batman]] in the wake of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]&#39;s recent success with the &#39;&#39;[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]&#39;&#39; [[live action]] television series.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Back Issue 2004\&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aquamanshrine.net/2008/05/aquaman-meets-blackhawks.html?m=1|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|title=The 1968 DC Filmation Pilots|first=Darren |last=McNeil|issue=5|date=July 2004|accessdate=May 1, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130220727/http://www.aquamanshrine.net/2008/05/aquaman-meets-blackhawks.html?m=1|archivedate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSubsequently, in 1968, the series became &#39;&#39;[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]&#39;&#39;, with new Superman/Superboy and Batman segments.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Back Issue 2004\&quot;/&gt; Previously-aired Aquaman shorts were repackaged into the 30-minute &#39;&#39;[[Aquaman (TV series)|Aquaman]]&#39;&#39;, which also included the existing guest star segments from &#39;&#39;The Superman/Aquaman Hour of  Adventure&#39;&#39;.\n\nThe series would be parodied in the &#39;&#39;[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Classic Titans\&quot;.\n\nDecades later, the show&#39;s format was copied by Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Bros. Television, which created &#39;&#39;[[The New Batman/Superman Adventures]]&#39;&#39;, a show which united episodes of &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Superman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; into one hour of episodes utilizing old episodes of both shows with new episodes. This show ran on [[The WB]]&#39;s Saturday morning block, [[Kids&#39; WB]], from 1997-2000.\n\n==Influence==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe show continued to evolve a narrative format that had been started with the original Superman radio show, featuring a narrator who served to both compress and dramatize the storytelling. Whereas the first season of &#39;&#39;The New Adventures of Superman&#39;&#39; had featured longtime radio narrator, [[Jackson Beck]], &#39;&#39;The Superman/Aquaman Hour of  Adventure&#39;&#39; was the first to feature actor [[Ted Knight]], who had made his Filmation debut as the narrator of the &#39;&#39;Adventures of Superboy&#39;&#39; segments late in the previous season of &#39;&#39;The New Adventures of Superman&#39;&#39;. Knight would become the main voice used in the narration of DC cartoons for over a decade, and remained the unofficial \&quot;voice of DC\&quot; even during the first year the cartoons were produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] under the &#39;&#39;[[Super Friends]]&#39;&#39; banner.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Aquaman===\n[[Image:Filmation Aquaman.jpg|thumb|right|Aquaman in &#39;&#39;The Superman/ Aquaman Hour of Adventure&#39;&#39;]]\n\nThirty-six Aquaman segments were produced:\n\n# \&quot;Menace of the Black Manta\&quot; - Aquaman and Aqualad must stop [[Black Manta]]&#39;s attempt to sink a mid-ocean luxury liner.\n# \&quot;The Rampaging Reptile-Men\&quot; - A hydropower relay station for Atlantis is attacked by maniacal reptile beings.\n# \&quot;The Return Of Nepto\&quot; - A Viking, frozen and sunk to the sea bottom, is accidentally revived, and attempts to conquer Atlantis.\n# \&quot;The Fiery Invaders\&quot; - Sun beings attack Earth to dry out its oceans.\n# \&quot;Sea Raiders\&quot; - Alien big game hunters land in the ocean.\n# \&quot;War Of The Water Worlds\&quot; - Mera is captured by a brutal plant being in a watery world beneath the sea.\n# \&quot;The Volcanic Monster\&quot; - A lava giant tears open a volcano and battles Aquaman.\n# \&quot;The Crimson Monster From The Pink Pool\&quot; - A monster that spews deadly acid from its tentacles marches toward Atlantis.\n# \&quot;The Ice Dragon\&quot; - A dragon who can freeze anything battles Aquaman.\n# \&quot;The Deadly Drillers\&quot; - Mole men use drilling submarines to attack Atlantis.\n# \&quot;Vassa, Queen Of The Mermen\&quot; - An evil sea queen attacks Atlantis with [[sperm whale]]-shaped submarines.\n# \&quot;The Microscopic Monsters\&quot; - Aquaman has invented an enlarging ray, but the device is stolen by [[Black Manta]].\n# \&quot;The Onslaught Of The Octomen\&quot; - An advanced race of eight-armed beings capture Aquaman.\n# \&quot;Treacherous Is The Torpedo Man\&quot; - The Torpedo Man, an armored being that can swim at super speed, lures the Aqua team to an unstable pirate wreck.\n# \&quot;The Satanic Saturnians\&quot; - Alien fish beings from Saturn attack the Earth.\n# \&quot;The Brain, The Brave And The Bold\&quot; - The Brain, a mutant scientist, uses his intelligence to combat Aquaman.\n# \&quot;Where Lurks the Fisherman!\&quot; - A sea pirate called [[Fisherman (comics)#In other media|the Fisherman]] rigs a trap at the Aquacave.\n# \&quot;Mephisto&#39;s Marine Marauders\&quot; - A Satanic marauder and his men attack an oxygen exchange plant before attacking Atlantis.\n# \&quot;Trio Of Terror\&quot; - While spying, Aqualad learns Black Manta and the Brain have allied with Queen Vassa in an attempt to overthrow Aquaman and Mera as the leaders of Atlantis.\n# \&quot;The Torp, The Magneto And The Claw\&quot; - The Torpedo Man teams up with two other armored beings named Magneto and the Claw in a plot to destroy Aquaman.\n# \&quot;Goliaths Of The Deep-Sea Gorge\&quot; - A mermaid society is attacked by a mastodon-like sea giant.\n# \&quot;The Sinister Sea Scamp\&quot; - A raider with a powerful animator beam turns a boulder of poisonous phosphorus into a sea giant.\n# \&quot;The Devil Fish\&quot; - Aquaman helps the Navy test an undersea fightercraft, a ship that is captured by Black Manta.\n# \&quot;The Sea Scavengers\&quot; - A gang of pirates wield a giant submarine robot.\n# \&quot;In Captain Cuda&#39;s Clutches\&quot; - A pirate with a giant starfish raids a bed of crystals.\n# \&quot;The Mirror-Man From Planet Imago\&quot; - The Brain receives a being molded into a perfect double of Aquaman from Reflecto of the planet Imago in a plot to take over Atlantis.
