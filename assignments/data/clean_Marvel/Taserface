After officially being assigned to direct Guardians of the Galaxy and considering Taserface to be \"the dumbest character of all time,\" Gunn jokingly posted a photo of him on his social media. He later clarified that he would never feature the character in a film. Gunn later changed his mind, and when crafting this character, felt that Taserface had named himself. Hence he described him as \"a real dumbass,\" yet also \"a very powerful guy.\" Taserface is depicted as being proud of his name as he believes it strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. However Rocket, and the rest of the Ravagers, scoff at the ridiculousness of his name. Feeling that Yondu is \"going soft\", he leads a mutiny against him which involves tossing those who are still loyal to him out the airlock.

But ultimately, he is just trying too hard.\"\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nTaserface appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel Superheroes 2.
