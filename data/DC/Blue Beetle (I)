The most recent of the companies to own rights to the Blue Beetle is [[DC Comics]] who bought the rights to the character in 1983, using the name for three distinct characters over the years.\n\nThe original Blue Beetle was created by [[Fox Comics]] and later owned by [[Charlton Comics]]. The first Beetle was [[Dan Garret]] (later spelled Dan Garrett), who initially gained super powers from a special vitamin, which was later changed to gaining powers from a \&quot;sacred scarab\&quot;. The original Blue Beetle was featured not only in his own comic but also a weekly [[Golden Age of Radio|radio serial]].\n\nThe second Blue Beetle was created by Charlton and later taken over by [[DC Comics]], the successor to Dan Garrett known as [[Ted Kord]]. Kord \&quot;jumped\&quot; to the DC Comics universe during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] alongside a number of other Charlton Comics characters. The second Blue Beetle later starred in his own 24 issue comic. Kord never had any super powers but used science to create various devices to help him fight crime. He became a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] and was later killed during DC Comics&#39; [[Infinite Crisis]] cross over.\n\nThe third Blue Beetle, created by DC Comics, is [[Jaime Reyes]], a teenager who discovered that the original Blue Beetle scarab morphed into a battle suit allowing him to fight crime and travel in space. Over the years Reyes became a member of the [[Teen Titans]] and starred in two Blue Beetle comic series. In DC Comics&#39; 2011 \&quot;New 52\&quot; reboot, Jaime Reyes was the primary Blue Beetle character, only occasionally referring to past versions. However, with the subsequent continuity revision \&quot;DC Rebirth\&quot;, the previous versions were restored.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{see also|Blue Beetle (comic book)}}\nThe original Blue Beetle, [[Dan Garret]], [[First appearance|first appeared]] in [[Fox Comics]]&#39; &#39;&#39;[[Mystery Men Comics]]&#39;&#39; #1 (cover-dated August 1939), with art by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski (as [[Charles Nicholas#Charles Wojtkoski|Charles Nicholas]]); though the [[Grand Comics Database]] tentatively credits [[Will Eisner]] as the scripter.&lt;ref&gt;Wojtkoski&#39;s family has supplied the online comics encyclopedia \&quot;The Lambiek Comiclopedia\&quot; with documentation to support the overall Wojtkoski credit. Another artist, [[Charles Nicholas#Chuck Cuidera|Charles Nicholas Cuidera]], also drew Blue YEEtle stories later, and has claimed to have been the creator, but comics historians credit Wojtkoski.\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/490/#11|title=&#39;&#39;Mystery Men Comics&#39;&#39; #1|accessdate=June 22, 2007|author=Mougin, Lou|work=[[Grand Comics Database]]}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/n/nicholas_charles2.htm|title=Charles Nicholas|accessdate=September 17, 2010|work=The Lambiek Comiclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rookie [[police officer]], he wore a special bulletproof costume and took \&quot;Vitamin 2X\&quot; which endowed him with super-energy, and he was assisted by a neighborhood pharmacist in his fight against crime. Blue Beetle starred in a comic book series, [[comic strip]] and [[radio]] serial, but like most [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroes, he fell into obscurity in the 1950s. The comic book series saw a number of anomalies in publication: 19 issues, #12 through #30, were published through [[Holyoke Publishing]]; no issue #43 was published; publication frequency varied throughout the run; and there were gaps where issues were not published, with large ones occurring in early 1947 and between mid-1948 and early 1950.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Fox Comics went out of business and sold the rights to the Blue Beetle to [[Charlton Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/foxfeatr.htm|title=Fox Feature Syndicate|publisher=[[Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia]]|accessdate=September 13, 2010|archivedate=2012-04-15|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66vzd3Z5l?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/foxfeatr.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; That company published a few sporadic adventures of the Golden Age character before revamping the hero in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;The two initial Charlton runs were:\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/1081/|title=Blue Beetle (1955)|work=Grand Comics Database|author=Mougin, Lou |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/1614/|title=Blue Beetle (1964)|work=Grand Comics Database|others=Klein, Bob, Ramon Schenk (indexers)|accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlton tried three times to use the character to carry a self-titled series. Two of the attempts retained the numbering of a previous title. These also were eventually replaced with new titles that carried on the numbering.\n\nThe new series was short-lived, and in the pages of &#39;&#39;[[Captain Atom]]&#39;&#39; #83 (cover-dated November 1966) through #86,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]]|cowriters=[[Gary Friedrich]]|artist=Ditko, Steve|title=[[Captain Atom]]|issue=83|date=November 1966|publisher=[[Charlton Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlton introduced [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Ted Kord]], a student of Dan Garrett&#39;s (note the changed spelling) who took on the role when Garrett died. Kord was an inventor hero, using a variety of gadgets. This Beetle received his own series in 1967, but the entire Charlton \&quot;Action Heroes\&quot; line of comic books ceased publication in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/beetle3.htm|title=The Blue Beetle (1967)|publisher=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia|accessdate=September 17, 2010|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120915080253/http://www.toonopedia.com/beetle3.htm|archivedate=September 15, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DarkMark|url=http://darkmark6.tripod.com/charlton_index.html|title=Charlton|work=Darkmark6.tripod.com |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/charlton.htm|title=Charlton Comics|publisher=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia|accessdate=September 13, 2010|archiveurl= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20180708063151/http://www.toonopedia.com/charlton.htm|archivedate=July 8, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rest of the Charlton line-up, he was sold to [[DC Comics]] in 1983 and appeared with several incarnations of the [[Justice League]].\n\nIn 2006, DC introduced a new Blue Beetle, teenager [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Jaime Reyes]], whose powers are derived from the scarab, now revealed as a piece of advanced alien technology.

The new book was written by [[Tony Bedard]] and drawn by [[Ig Guara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsarama.com/7913-bedard-dcnu-blue-beetle-spider-man-meets-green-lantern.html|title=Bedard: DCnU BLUE BEETLE, &#39;Spider-Man Meets Green Lantern&#39;|work=Newsarama.com|date=June 30, 2011|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/878152/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Blue Beetle #1|work=comics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBoth Blue Beetles reappeared in the third issue of &#39;&#39;[[Americomics]]&#39;&#39;, a title published by [[AC Comics]] in 1983/1984. In the first story in this issue, Ted Kord fought a bogus Dan Garrett, but the second story was more significant. It revealed that the original 1940s Dan was reincarnated as the Silver Age version (minus his memories of his earlier existence) by some unspecified \&quot;gods\&quot;, presumably the ones responsible for his mystic scarab. The gods subsequently resurrected Dan again and sent him off to save Ted Kord&#39;s life (leaving him a note saying simply, \&quot;Try not to get killed this time\&quot;) After this adventure, Kord turned the Blue Beetle name back over to Dan. &#39;&#39;Americomics&#39;&#39; was canceled after issue #6, and so far this story has never been referenced by any other publisher. Another Blue Beetle crossover story depiction revolving around the Blue Beetles is depicted in &#39;&#39;Booster Gold&#39;&#39; (vol. 2)#6 by [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;BGv2i6\&quot;&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Johns, Geoff|cowriters=Jeff Katz|penciller=Jurgens, Dan|inker=Rapmund, Norm|story=52 Pick-Up, Chapter 6: Meet the Beetles|title=Booster Gold|volume=2|issue=6|date=March 2008|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Blue Beetles==\n===Dan Garret / Dan Garrett ===\n{{Main|Blue Beetle (Dan Garrett)}}\nThe original [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Blue Beetle is Dan Garret,&lt;ref name=\&quot;ref4\&quot;&gt;In the earliest Golden Age appearances and during the mid-1960s run by writer-artist [[Steve Ditko]], the original Blue Beetle was referred to as Dan \&quot;Garret\&quot;, spelled with one \&quot;t\&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; son of a police officer killed by a criminal.

This Beetle was [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] Dan Garrett, who obtained a number of superhuman powers (including super strength and vision, flight, and the ability to generate energy blasts) from a mystical [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] he found during a dig in [[Egypt]], where it had been used to imprison an evil mummified Pharaoh.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Beatty|first=Scott|author-link=Scott Beatty|contribution=Blue Beetle|editor-last=Dougall|editor-first=Alastair|title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page=57|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=London|year=2008|isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would transform into the Blue Beetle by saying the words \&quot;Kaji Dha!\&quot; This version, by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist [[Tony Tallarico]], was played at least initially for [[Camp (style)|camp]], with stories like \&quot;The Giant Mummy Who was Not Dead\&quot;.

Kord and Garrett were investigating Kord&#39;s Uncle Jarvis when they learned Jarvis was working to create an army of androids to take over Earth. Garrett changed into Blue Beetle, but was killed in battle. As he died, he passed on to Kord the responsibility of being Blue Beetle, but was unable to pass on the mystical scarab.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blue Beetle&#39;&#39; vol. 5, #2 (Charlton Comics, Aug. 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTed had the scarab for some time, but never used it. He carried it during the &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; when he was chosen by the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] to protect the multiple Earths, but it only reacted when he was attacked; it did not give him superpowers.\n\nDuring the \&quot;[[The Death of Superman|Death of Superman]]\&quot; saga, the Blue Beetle and the other JLA members tried to stop [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]&#39;s path of destruction.

He was captured and executed with a single gunshot to the head. Before dying, he had used the scarab in an attempt to contact [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]], but was forced to leave it with the wizard [[Shazam (character)|Shazam]] in the Rock of Eternity when the wizard sent him back to [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; one-shot (May 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSome time later, [[Booster Gold]], along with Jaime, Dan, and the [[Black Beetle (DC Comics)|Black Beetle]] in the guise of a Blue Beetle from the future, travels back in time to rescue Kord moments before his death.&lt;ref name=\&quot;BGv2i6\&quot;/&gt;\n{{clear}}\n\n===Jaime Reyes===\n{{Main article|Jaime Reyes}}\n&#39;&#39;&#39;Jaime Reyes&#39;&#39;&#39; is a teenager who lives in [[El Paso, Texas]], with his father, mother, and little sister; his father owns a garage and his mother is a nurse.

After being defeated by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] thousands of years ago and forced into a truce, the Reach poses as benevolent aliens lending their advanced technology to budding civilizations. The scarab is a gift for that world&#39;s champion, giving him amazing powers and the knowledge of the Reach to protect his or her peers. Secretly, the scarab is part of an advanced [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]], with its own artificial intelligence covertly supplanting the wearer&#39;s own. The wearer is turned into the \&quot;ultimate [[Sleeper agent|infiltrator]]\&quot;, a covert agent intended to take over its own world.&lt;ref name=\&quot;BBv6i18\&quot;/&gt; However, the Blue Beetle Scarab is damaged and so instead of it controlling the host, it forms a symbiotic relationship with them.\n\nThe Blue Beetle scarab uses its serial number, Khaji Da, as its name.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;Blue Beetle&#39; (2006) #25&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn The New 52, the Reach forgoes the secrecy, and each wearer immediately becomes possessed by the scarab. It then uses its host&#39;s knowledge to decimate the world and prepare it for a full invasion by Reach forces.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blue Beetle&#39;&#39; vol 2 #0 (September 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn &#39;&#39;DC Universe: Rebirth&#39;&#39;, Ted Kord and Jaime Reyes believe the scarab is an alien device that bonded to Jaime&#39;s spine. Kord is fascinated by this scarab and wants to investigate the potential of it while Jaime fears it. When Jaime leaves Kord&#39;s lab to get to school, Dr. Fate appears in the lab to warn Kord that the scarab is not an alien device, but it is instead magic. This further sparks Kord&#39;s interest in the potential of the scarab.\n\n==Enemies==\n{{Main article|List of Blue Beetle enemies}}\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Kingdom Come===\nBlue Beetle (Ted Kord) was seen in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]&#39;s limited series &#39;&#39;[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]&#39;&#39;. He is shown with the rest of the Charlton \&quot;Action Heroes\&quot; not as a member of [[Magog (comics)|Magog]]&#39;s [[Justice Battalion]], but as part of [[Batman]]&#39;s group and later of the MLF (Mankind Liberation Front). He would be shown later in the title in a suit of armor powered by the then-mystic scarab, working with Batman&#39;s team. In the novelization of the series, Batman thinks of Blue Beetle, along with [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]], as his closest (at the time) friends. Blue Beetle is killed with most of the other heroes by a nuclear explosion.\n\n===52 Multiverse===\n[[Image:Blue Beetle Elseworld.jpg|thumb|The [[Gotham by Gaslight#Countdown|Earth-19]] Blue Beetle.]]\n\nThe final issue, #52, of DC Comics&#39; 2006/2007 year-long weekly series &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39; revealed that a \&quot;[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]\&quot; system of [[Worlds of the 52 multiverse|52 parallel universes]], with each Earth being a different take on established DC Comics characters as featured in the mainstream continuity (designated as \&quot;New Earth\&quot;) had come into existence. The Multiverse acts as a storytelling device that allows writers to introduce alternate versions of fictional characters, hypothesize \&quot;What if?\&quot; scenarios, revisit popular Elseworlds stories and allow these characters to interact with the mainstream continuity. For example, the Ted Kord of the &#39;&#39;Kingdom Come&#39;&#39; limited series is said to reside on Earth-22.\n\nSpin-offs from the series &#39;&#39;[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39; would introduce more alternate Blue Beetles in 2007. Earth-19 (the &#39;&#39;[[Gotham by Gaslight]]&#39;&#39; universe), set in a Victorian-like era, has its own version of Dan Garrett who in his secret identity is the leading Egyptologist at the Gotham Museum of Natural History and wears a monocle, appearing in &#39;&#39;The Search for Ray Palmer: Gotham by Gaslight&#39;&#39;. The limited series &#39;&#39;[[Countdown: Arena]]&#39;&#39; depicted three more: Earth-26 Blue Beetle, a swarm of sentient insects that form a man-shaped body (calling themselves \&quot;The Scarab\&quot;), Ted of Earth-33, an anthropomorphic beetle, the pet of Mr. and Mrs. Kord, and Earth-39 Blue Beetle, a younger version of Dan Garrett, who has bonded with his scarab in the same way as Jaime Reyes.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Countdown: Arena&#39;&#39; #1\u20134 (December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA new version of the Blue Beetle known as \&quot;Blue Scarab\&quot; was shown as a member of the Justice League in the apocalyptic future depicted in &#39;&#39;Justice League: Generation Lost&#39;&#39;. He is stated as being the \&quot;descendant of the Blue Beetle\&quot;, and has a very alien-looking appearance.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League: Generation Lost&#39;&#39; #14 (Late January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAn evil version has appeared in the [[antimatter universe of Qward]], the [[universe]] of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]], known as the Scarab.\n \n===DC Animated Universe comics===\nBlue Beetle has appeared in the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; spin-off comic book, in issues #5 and #8.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Radio===\n{{Main article|The Blue Beetle}}\nThe Blue Beetle had a short career on the radio, between May and September 1940.

Dan Garrett makes a brief, non-voiced appearance in \&quot;Fall of the Blue Beetle!\&quot; as [[Batman]] narrates about the Blue Beetles to Jaime Reyes and \&quot;Menace of the Madniks!\&quot; displayed his Blue Beetle suit next to Ted Kord&#39;s suit.\n* The Jaime Reyes version of Blue Beetle appears in [[Young Justice (TV series)#&#39;The Team&#39; subsequent members|season 2]] of &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by actor [[Eric Lopez (voice actor)|Eric Lopez]]. In a [[running gag]], Jaime can often be seen rejecting the Blue Beetle Scarab&#39;s (also voiced by Lopez) more violent and bloodthirsty suggestions (\&quot;No, it would &#39;&#39;not&#39;&#39; have been easier to just vaporize him back in the diner!\&quot;), which confuses those around him as it looks like he&#39;s talking to himself. Much of season 2&#39;s main story arc also revolves around Jaime&#39;s main antagonists, the Reach. Dan Garrett, the original Blue Beetle, appears in a non-speaking cameo in the episode \&quot;Failsafe\&quot;, in which several scenes depict the members of the [[Justice Society of America]], in 1939. Dan appears among several of the most prominent members of the team, such as [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]], [[Doctor Fate]], and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]]. The episode \&quot;Intervention\&quot; later tells the full story of the scarab: ancient Bialyan mystics deactivated its Reach control centuries ago, and it lay dormant until it was discovered by Dan Garrett, who fused with it to become the first Blue Beetle. His successor and protege, the technological genius Ted Kord, was able to recognize the Scarab as a potentially dangerous piece of alien technology, and thus made use of his own inventions as a hero. Kord later lost his life in a battle with [[Deathstroke]] and [[Sportsmaster]] upon discovering [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]] planned to steal and reactivate the Scarab. Jaime came across the Scarab just after Ted Kord&#39;s death, and became the third Blue Beetle while believing the Scarab was Kord&#39;s own invention. He was recruited into the Justice League&#39;s teenage strike team, where subsequent conflicts with the Reach led him to discover the Scarab&#39;s true origin and purpose, but his attempts to remove it were unable to keep his body from being completely controlled by it. Some of the Team made a separate discovery of a ritual that could remove the Reach&#39;s control over the Scarab, and kept the knowledge quiet while Doctor Fate taught Zatanna the ritual, so the Team could once again deactivate the Scarab to allow Jaime to resume control.
