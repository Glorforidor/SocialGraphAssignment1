Created by writer Jack Miller and artist [[Ruben Moreira]], the character first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; #20 (May 1959).&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following three more appearances in &#39;&#39;Showcase&#39;&#39; (#21, 25, 26), Rip Hunter was given his own series which ran for 29 issues (1961\u201365). He later starred in the eight-issue &#39;&#39;Time Masters&#39;&#39; series (1990), written by Bob Wayne and [[Lewis Shiner]]. After numerous revisions and following the events of the 2005 \&quot;[[Infinite Crisis]]\&quot; storyline, Hunter is established as the son of [[Booster Gold]].\n\nThe character, portrayed by [[Arthur Darvill]], appeared in the first three seasons of [[The CW]]&#39;s television series &#39;&#39;[[Legends of Tomorrow]]&#39;&#39;.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe [[Challengers of the Unknown]] is a quartet of science fiction adventurers created by [[Jack Kirby]]. They debuted in 1957, and their commercial success spawned two other science fiction characters: [[Cave Carson]] and Rip Hunter. Hunter was the more successful of the two, with art in his early appearances by [[Joe Kubert]], [[Mike Sekowsky]], and [[Nick Cardy]]. Hunter was the leader of a gang of time travelers who were featured in brisk and historically accurate adventures in various eras. DC editor [[Jack Schiff]] reported that he and writer Jack Miller had \&quot;lots of fun\&quot; creating the comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Comic Book Heroes: From the Silver Age to the Present |last=Jacobs |first=Will |author2=[[Gerard Jones]] |year=1985 |publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]] |location=New York, New York |isbn=0-517-55440-2 |pages=38\u201339}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRip Hunter has had a number of revisions within the fictional DC Universe. Those changes are generally connected to larger events and story lines. The writing and editorial staff often use a narrative device within the comics, known as a crisis event, to explain dramatic changes to the appearance or personality of characters. Rip Hunter has undergone a number of different developments within this fictional universe.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:Riphunterdcu0.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover of &#39;&#39;Time Masters&#39;&#39; #1. Art by [[Art Thibert]].]]\nIn his original incarnation, Rip Hunter is portrayed as an ordinary man who uses his invention, the [[Time Sphere]], to travel through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/riphuntr.htm |title=Rip Hunter, Time Master}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by his friend Jeff Smith, girlfriend Bonnie Baxter, and Bonnie&#39;s kid brother Corky, they have adventures in time. These stories were told in the series &#39;&#39;Rip Hunter...Time Master&#39;&#39; which ran for 29 issues between 1961 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRip is next seen in the series &#39;&#39;Challengers of the Unknown&#39;&#39;, where, in the year [[AD]] 12,000,000, he assists the [[Challengers of the Unknown]], [[Swamp Thing]], and [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] in defeating the dictatorial Sun Lords.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Challengers of the Unknown&#39;&#39; #85-87&lt;/ref&gt; The character&#39;s next major appearance is in &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39; #552\u2013554. With the aid of [[Superman]] and the team known as the [[Forgotten Heroes]], an alien invasion of Earth is prevented.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #552\u2013554 (February\u2013April 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Forgotten Heroes are then seen in the 1985 series &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39;, a mini-series intended to change the fictional universe shared by DC characters. During this story, Hunter serves as a plot device to enable the superheroes of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] to travel to the [[dawn of time]] where they face off against the [[Anti-Monitor]]. The battle that ensues effectively destroys the Multiverse. Hunter then reunites with some of his Forgotten Heroes teammates, as well as cosmic heroes [[Adam Strange]] and [[Captain Comet]] in a quest to defeat the Anti-Monitor once and for all. With the help of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], they journey to [[Apokolips]], where the tyrant [[Darkseid]] uses his advanced science to peer into the Anti-Matter universe and aid [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alex Luthor]], [[Superman (Kal-L)|Superman]], and [[Superboy-Prime]] in the ultimate destruction of the Anti-Monitor.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Crisis on Infinite Earths&#39;&#39; #11&lt;/ref&gt; This narrative event allowed the writing staff of DC Comics to alter many of their heroes and fictional situations.\n\nThe &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; series was used as a plot device to dramatically alter the fictional histories of many characters. Unlike most other characters, Hunter continues with the same personality and memories that preceded this event. This event was used as a literary device to portray him as a man out of time and without a home. No one remembers that he existed. The writers further expanded on this by having their new fictional universe contain an alternative version of Rip, one who was native to this timeline, and also a master of time travel.\n\nThe original version of Rip is then depicted as attracting the attention of the [[Linear Men (comics)|Linear Men]] with his attempts to reach his original universe.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Legends of the DC Universe 80-page Giant&#39;&#39; #1 (Sep. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed by Hunter, the [[Linear Men]] recruit him into their ranks and the writers altered the appearance of Rip, using the stress of time travel as an explanation for those changes. Now, with white hair and bionic implants, he is seen in a number of series that involve time, or the manipulation of time as an element of the narrative\u2014most notably during the &#39;&#39;[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]&#39;&#39; mini-series and event.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]&#39;&#39;, Hunter turns on the other Linear Men, who believe that time follows a single course of events, and joins forces with Superman, [[Batman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]. Rip also joins forces with young heroes from the future, to stop the time-traveling villain [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]] in his efforts to destroy Kansas twenty years ahead of schedule. As a result of this battle, Hunter finally breaks down the barrier to [[Hypertime]], revealing that the Linear Men are wrong about the non-existence of alternate timelines in the post-Crisis universe. Rip also reveals that the timeline of the Kingdom can exist, regardless of what happens in the present.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Kingdom&#39;&#39; #2 (Feb. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nShortly thereafter, the Linear Men, including the original character of Hunter, are destroyed during the [[Imperiex]] onslaught.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #165 (Feb. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Although their consciousnesses survive, and they eventually construct new bodies for themselves, they have been driven insane by the experience. The Quintessence, a group of cosmic beings who counsel one another, disband the Linear Men, and Hunter vanishes in a whirlwind.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman the Man of Steel&#39;&#39; #118 (November 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRunning parallel to those stories, another version of Rip has adventures; as the inventor of time travel technology in the Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; universe.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week Six&lt;/ref&gt; In this universe, Hunter aids heroes [[Booster Gold]] and [[Animal Man]] in their own time-traveling adventures, before taking on the vast Illuminati conspiracy during the eight issue series &#39;&#39;Time Masters&#39;&#39;. This more gritty and realistic (symbolized by jeans and a T-shirt rather than a costume) take on the character attempts to change the past to prevent the Illuminati, led by [[Vandal Savage]], from coming into existence. During the series, a relative of the character known as Dan Hunter decides to stay in the past at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. This is used to create a link between Rip Hunter and the pre-existing western themed Dan Hunter, a character associated with [[Tomahawk (comics)|Tomahawk]]. This series concludes with Hunter being stranded in the prehistoric past.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Time Masters&#39;&#39; 1\u20138 (February\u2013September 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]]&#39;&#39; series, starring Walker Gabriel, an alternate version of Gabriel, experimenting with time travel to avert World War III, mentions a horrible accident suffered by a Commander Hunter, who apparently scattered himself across time, with only \&quot;bits of flesh and bone\&quot; which kept resynchronizing in the lab.\n\nRip&#39;s next major appearance is within the page of 2004&#39;s &#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39;, where he takes members of the modern day [[Justice Society of America]] back in time to fight the villainous [[Per Degaton]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;JSA&#39;&#39; #66, 68\u201372 (December 2004 \u2013 June 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Rip serves as a device that allows for time-travel, and for other heroes to travel forwards and backwards in time. This version of the character returns to a sci-fi influenced costume and the use of a time bubble. The ramifications of being a time-traveler are explored by the writer [[Geoff Johns]], who turns the name Rip Hunter into an alias. This is explained as being part of an attempt by the character to hide all of the details of his history, lest an enemy travel back in time and kill him as a child.\n\n===&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39;===\nThe themes of time and changes to the timeline are next explored in the weekly series &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39;. Following up from events in the &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; mini-series, [[Booster Gold]] tries to contact Hunter. Booster discovers his base of operations in a time-locked concrete bunker in the [[Arizona]] desert, but when he finally manages to enter the bunker, he finds only a [[blackboard]], a [[globe]], and some pieces of paper filled with writings about the future. These papers had references to facts and events like the mortality of [[Vandal Savage]], the last [[Lazarus Pit]] of [[Nyssa Raatko]], and the appearances of the mysterious [[Supernova (comics)|Supernova]]. The purpose of the blackboard was to provide clues for the readers of upcoming storylines within that series and other DC Universe titles.\n\nAs this series progresses, more and more time-traveling characters, such as [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] are killed by a mysterious figure who is later revealed to be [[Skeets (DC Comics)|Skeets]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week Nineteen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week Twenty-Seven&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHunter finally emerges in the Bottle City of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]]. Working with Supernova, Hunter has been trying to put together a machine that will \&quot;fix\&quot; time before Skeets can find him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week Thirty-Six&lt;/ref&gt; When Skeets attacks Kandor, Supernova turns back into Booster Gold and battles Skeets using special items gathered from the planet. Rip Hunter and Booster then teleport away, angering Skeets even more.&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;52\&quot; Week Thirty-Seven&lt;/ref&gt; Upon discovering [[Mr. Mind]] burrowing into Skeets&#39; shell, Rip Hunter uses [[T.O. Morrow]] and the severed head of [[Red Tornado]] as bait for the [[Venusians|Venusian]] [[worm]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week Fifty-One&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Mind metamorphoses into a nigh-omnipotent [[imago]] form, a &#39;&#39;hyperfly&#39;&#39; feeding on universes. Hunter then reveals to [[Booster Gold]] and Booster&#39;s ancestor Daniel Carter that the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] is restored as 52 individual universes as a result of Alex Luthor&#39;s actions after he escaped his \&quot;paradise dimension\&quot;. Mr. Mind seeks to devour every parallel universe. Sealing Mr. Mind in a time-rift, the multiverse is saved.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week Fifty-Two&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter warns the others to keep the Multiverse a secret for the time being as he eagerly prepares to explore it.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Booster Gold&#39;&#39;===\nRip is next seen as an integral part of the cast of the &#39;&#39;[[Booster Gold (2007-)|Booster Gold]]&#39;&#39; series. Rip acts as a companion and boss to Booster Gold. His identity is revealed to be that of Booster Gold&#39;s yet-to-be-born son and that most, if not all, of Rip&#39;s exploits committed were actually committed by Booster.\n\nTo protect the timeline, Rip convinces Booster to turn down membership in the recently reformed Justice League and to continue to act like a self-absorbed goof in order to make sure that his father&#39;s legacy is one of failure and is ultimately forgotten by history. This is done to ensure rogue time travelers have no motivation to kill Booster in the past, erasing Rip in the process and the various works he and Booster will engage in to protect the timestream. Rip and an older Booster occasionally would interact during the present version&#39;s mission, as they discuss the need to manipulate Booster (in particular, teaching him not to change history when Booster demands they prevent the death of Ted Kord.) .&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Booster Gold&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #30 (March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn [[Carl Draper]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]&#39;&#39; blog, a reference is made to the Smith-Baxter Group, a time-travel consultancy whose founders were trained by Hunter.\n\nThis new version of Rip Hunters&#39; methods are darker than previously portrayed: he imprisoned the surviving members of the [[Linear Men]] after they tried to mess with the timeline to save the time abnormality Waverider and used torture against Rex Hunter/Jason Goldstein when he wouldn&#39;t give Rip the information he needed. The latter might have also been somewhat motivated by a personal grudge. (It should be noted Rex was a former Time Master that had already murdered Rips&#39; previous team.)
