He also co-created such features as [[Aquaman]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Johnny Quick]], and [[Vigilante (Greg Saunders)|the original Vigilante]], served as story editor for the &#39;&#39;[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]&#39;&#39; television series, and compiled the often-revised paperback &#39;&#39;1001 Valuable Things You Can Get Free&#39;&#39;.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and SF fandom===\nWeisinger was born in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] section of [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and was raised in the [[Bronx]], as the son of [[History of the Jews in Austria|Austrian Jewish]] parents. His father was a businessman in the garment trade. At 13, he was introduced to science fiction by means of a borrowed copy of the August 1928 issue of &#39;&#39;[[Amazing Stories]]&#39;&#39; (featuring [[Buck Rogers]] and [[The Skylark of Space]]). By 1930, Weisinger was active in some of the earliest SF [[fan club]]s and [[fanzine]]s, including &#39;&#39;The Planet&#39;&#39;. In 1931, Weisinger hosted a meeting of pioneer SF fan club \&quot;The Scienceers,\&quot; which was attended by a young [[Julius Schwartz]], who recalled that the two became \&quot;very friendly... [and] got along well together.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Peel\&quot;&gt;Peel, John, \&quot;Julius Schwartz,\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Comics Feature&#39;&#39; (NMP, July/Aug, 1984), pp. 32-41&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Weisinger, Schwartz and Allen Glasser joined fellow-future professional editor [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] in founding &#39;&#39;[[The Time Traveller (fanzine)|The Time Traveller]]&#39;&#39;, which they styled \&quot;Science Fiction&#39;s Only Fan Magazine\&quot;. The claim was more than mere youthful bravado, according to SF historian [[Sam Moskowitz]], who described the &#39;zine as the first devoted entirely to science fiction. Drawing on information they had gleaned from writing letters to the SF magazines and authors of the day, the young fans published interviews with, and short pieces by, established SF writers, and in the process gained increasing familiarity with the personalities and situations of the genre in that era. The first issue featured \&quot;a one-page biography of [[E. E. Smith|Edward &#39;Doc&#39; Smith]]... [and] some news items.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Peel\&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Early career===\nAfter [[high school]], Weisinger attended [[New York University]], where he worked as editor of the college&#39;s newspaper and magazine, but left before graduating. With Schwartz, he approached the editor of &#39;&#39;[[Amazing Stories]]&#39;&#39; (T. Connor Sloane) and \&quot;sold his first story\&quot;: &#39;The Price of Peace&#39;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Peel\&quot;/&gt; In late 1934, Weisinger suggested that he and Schwartz \&quot;ought to go into the agency business,\&quot; noting (according to Schwartz) that the duo had\n{{cquote|\&quot;...got to know a lot of writers and artists and so on... [Mort explained] &#39;When a writer writes a story he lives out of town, and he mails it to &#39;&#39;Amazing Stories&#39;&#39;. If it&#39;s rejected, it has to go all the way back to California. So he sends it to &#39;&#39;[[Wonder Stories]]&#39;&#39;. Then it goes back and forth, because they send it blind. They don&#39;t know what the editor wants. Now we talk to the editors, and he can find out if they want an interplanetary story of about six thousand words, or if they want this or that. Then we can relay this information to the writers. And of course we can become their agents and collect the usual fee of 10%.&#39; \&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Peel\&quot;/&gt;}}\n\nSchwartz concurred, and they formed the Solar Sales Service (\&quot;We always believed in [[alliteration]],\&quot; noted Schwartz&lt;ref name=\&quot;Peel\&quot;/&gt;), the first literary agency to specialize in the related genres of SF, horror, and fantasy. [[Edmond Hamilton]] was the agency&#39;s first client, and [[Otto Binder]] soon followed.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Peel\&quot;/&gt; Solar Sales eventually represented many prominent SF and fantasy writers, including [[John Russell Fearn]], [[Alfred Bester]], [[Stanley Weinbaum]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and [[Ray Bradbury]]. But while Schwartz continued the agency into the early 1940s, Weisinger moved on; he took a job with the Standard Magazine chain, publisher of a range of [[pulp magazines]]. Standard had acquired writer-publisher [[Hugo Gernsback]]&#39;s defunct &#39;&#39;[[Wonder Stories]]&#39;&#39; and added it to Standard series of \&quot;Thrilling\&quot; publications (&#39;&#39;Thrilling Detective,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Thrilling Western&#39;&#39;, and others). Weisinger became the editor of &#39;&#39;Thrilling Wonder Stories,&#39;&#39;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;&gt;Lillian III, Guy H., \&quot;Mort Weisinger: The Man Who Wouldn&#39;t Be Superman,\&quot; in &#39;&#39;[[The Amazing World of DC Comics]]&#39;&#39; #7 (July 1975), pp. 2-8&lt;/ref&gt; and bought stories by Hamilton and others from his former partner Schwartz. Weisinger was soon editing a range of other pulps by Standard, including &#39;&#39;[[Startling Stories]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Captain Future]]&#39;&#39;, and \&quot;was in charge of no fewer than 40 titles\&quot; by 1940.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;\n\n==National Periodical Publications (DC Comics)==\n===Army service===\nIn March 1941, Weisinger moved from Standard Magazines to National Periodicals (later [[DC Comics]]) primarily as editor of the &#39;&#39;[[Superman]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Batman]]&#39;&#39; titles.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; Among his earliest jobs, however, was the task of \&quot;dream[ing] up some new characters\&quot; - these resulted in the line-up of &#39;&#39;[[More Fun Comics]]&#39;&#39; #73, and took the form of [[Aquaman]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Vigilante (Greg Saunders)|Vigilante]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; Weisinger&#39;s fledgling career was soon interrupted when he was conscripted in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;https://aad.archives.gov/aad/record-detail.jsp?dt=893&amp;mtch=1&amp;cat=all&amp;tf=F&amp;q=Mortimer+Weisinger&amp;bc=&amp;rpp=10&amp;pg=1&amp;rid=3011168&lt;/ref&gt; and he served as a [[sergeant]] in Special Services. Stationed at [[Yale]] (and rooming with [[Broderick Crawford]] and [[William Holden]]), he wrote scripts for a [[U.S. Army]] \&quot;[[radio show]] called &#39;I Sustain the Wings&#39; \&quot; in New York City.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;\n\nHe met and married (Sept. 27, 1943) his wife, the former Thelma Rudnick. They would have two children, a daughter, Joyce, and son, Hendrie.\n\n===Superman innovations===\n[[Image:Adventure296.png|thumb|200px|right|&#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39; #296 (May 1962). Editor Weisinger&#39;s Superman and Superboy stories often featured outlandish situations. Cover art by [[Curt Swan]], inks by [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]].]]Weisinger returned to his job at National after his discharge from military service in 1946, and resumed his editorship of the Superman comics, the Batman titles and others. His tenure was marked by the introduction of a variety of new concepts and supporting characters, including [[Supergirl]], [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]], the [[Phantom Zone]], the bottle city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], and a variety of types of [[kryptonite]]. Attempting to rationalize Superman&#39;s powers, it was under Weisinger&#39;s watch that the \&quot;concept that in a world circling a yellow sun [as opposed to Krypton&#39;s red sun] his [Superman&#39;s] powers are multiplied\&quot; came to be introduced to the Superman mythology.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; Realising that \&quot;Batman was my favorite [character],\&quot; Weisinger realised that the crucial difference was that \&quot;Batman can get hurt.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; In order to better allow the reader to identify with the invulnerable Man of Steel, Weisinger frequently featured stories in which \&quot;Superman lost his powers and had to survive on his natural wits.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; Pitted against Superman&#39;s wits was [[Lois Lane]], and under Weisinger&#39;s editorship stories in which she sought to prove that Superman was Clark Kent abounded. Weisinger \&quot;enjoyed surprising the readers,\&quot; and to that end introduced a number of \&quot;live personalities... real people\&quot; into the comics, including &#39;&#39;[[Candid Camera]]&#39;&#39;&lt;nowiki&gt;&#39;&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Alan Funt]], &#39;&#39;[[This is Your Life]]&#39;&#39;&lt;nowiki&gt;&#39;&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Ralph Edwards]], [[Steve Allen]], [[Ann Blyth]] and [[Pat Boone]] among others.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; Weisinger was particularly \&quot;proud of having dreamed up the \&quot;[[Elseworlds#\&quot;Imaginary Stories\&quot;|imaginary story]]\&quot; gimmick to motivate otherwise impossible stories,\&quot; (non-canonical &#39;what if...?&#39; scenarios not bound to series or character continuity, timeframe or logic), and for \&quot;having conceived the idea of DC&#39;s first giant anthology - &#39;&#39;&#39;The Superman Annual&#39;&#39;&#39;.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;\n\n===The Adventures of Superman===\nWeisinger \&quot;eventually gave up editorship of &#39;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39;&#39; and many of the other magazines and concentrated on the #1 superhero,\&quot; both in the comics and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; In the early 1950s, he was \&quot;called out to California by [[Whitney Ellsworth]] . . . to work as story editor for the Superman [[The Adventures of Superman (TV series)|TV series]].\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; Weisinger recalled in 1975 about this experience that\n{{cquote|On the way out to the coast, we sat in a roomette on a train with a tape recorder and plotted about fifteen stories for the series. I met [[George Reeves]], the actor who played Superman and was one helluva nice guy \u2014 very, very unaffected. The amazing thing was that when you met Reeves you said, &#39;My lord, it&#39;s Clark Kent!&#39; It was like seeing Clark step out of the comic pages into three dimensions.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;}}\nThrough Weisinger&#39;s previous \&quot;experience with television,\&quot; Reeves landed \&quot;a [[guest star]] spot, \&quot;Big Red S\&quot; and all, on the &#39;&#39;[[I Love Lucy]]&#39;&#39; show.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;\n\nWeisinger&#39;s influences on up-and-coming writers in SF and comics also extended, by these means, to television. [[Jackson Gillis]] was shepherded from his work on &#39;&#39;The Adventures of Superman&#39;&#39; to &#39;&#39;[[Perry Mason (1957 TV series)|Perry Mason]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Columbo]]&#39;&#39; (alongside many, many other credits).&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; Weisinger also highlights [[David Chantler]], [[William Woolfolk]] and [[Leigh Brackett]] as \&quot;examples of proteges and associates who have surpassed him in term of success.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Superman editorship===\nMany of Weisinger&#39;s ideas came from talking to kids in his neighborhood, asking them what they wanted to see, and then attempting to riff on those ideas. Such talks inspired him to create the &#39;&#39;Lois Lane&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Jimmy Olsen&#39;&#39; spin-off titles \&quot;over a lot of opposition\&quot; from the management who \&quot;protested that the characters weren&#39;t strong enough.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; Weisinger later bought a story from [[Jim Shooter]] while unaware of the writer&#39;s age,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/shooter_1.shtml Jim Shooter interview, Silver Age Sage (2008).] Accessed Apr. 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and hiring him for a popular run on \&quot;The [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]\&quot; even after discovering that he was only 14 years old.\n\nWeisinger encouraged a static [[picture book]] style of illustration in his stories,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} and was known for reusing previously published stories as new story ideas. A noted example of this is a 1950s story featuring Superman encountering an alien being he thought might have been his long-lost brother; this was reused in the early 1960s as a [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] story introducing [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;sb89\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Superboy&#39;&#39; #89 (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOver time, Weisinger found himself growing disenchanted, and even embarrassed to reveal his primary job, saying \&quot;When people asked me what I did for a living, I would suppress the fact that I was editing Superman. I&#39;d tell people that I wrote for &#39;&#39;Collier&#39;s&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;The Saturday Evening Post&#39;&#39;.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; He recalls that he attempted to get himself removed from his editorial position by \&quot;asking for bigger and bigger raises,\&quot; but instead found his demands met - even to the extent that he was given \&quot;generous stock options\&quot; and \&quot;made a vice president of public relations for the company.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; He did eventually leave, and bought himself a white [[Cadillac]] to \&quot;bolster my ego.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Style and criticism===\nWeisinger was criticized by some for having a [[micromanagement|micromanaging]] attitude and a heavy-handed, overbearing treatment of his writers and artists. He was well known for his abusive treatment of the DC employees. Indeed, his son also confirms he was abusive to restaurant waiters as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrie Weisinger Facebook quote&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Curt Swan]], quoted in  Zeno, Eddy. &#39;&#39;Curt Swan: A Life in Comics&#39;&#39; (Vanguard, 2001): \&quot;I was getting terrible migraine headaches and had these verbal battles with Mort. So it was emotional, physical. It just drained me and I thought I&#39;d better get out of here before I go whacko.\&quot; Zeno notes, \&quot;The headaches went away after [Swan] gained Weisinger&#39;s respect by standing up to him.\&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shooter, Jim, quoted in [http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/shooter_2.shtml \&quot;The Silver Age Sage: Interview with Jim Shooter, part 2\&quot; by BDS], on Weisinger&#39;s treatment of his assistant editor [[E. Nelson Bridwell]]: \&quot;Boy, he tortured Nelson. He just was awful to Nelson.\&quot; Retrieved July 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism has also been leveled at Weisinger for quashing creativity by dictating storylines. [[Jim Shooter]], who wrote for years under his editorship, praised Weisinger&#39;s \&quot;rules\&quot; for writing comics but criticized his rigid adherence to them: \&quot;. . . Mort\u2019s rules &#39;&#39;always&#39;&#39; worked, story-mechanics-wise. Easy, idiot-proof, safe. Trying things that explored the frontiers beyond the confines of Mort\u2019s rules was tricky\u2014fraught with opportunities to fail\u2014but if you were daring, if you had the necessary depth of understanding and the skills, you could do wonderful things.\&quot;[emphasis in original]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Vaughn|first= J. C.|date= June 2009|title= Jim Shooter&#39;s First Day at Marvel Comics|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 34|page= 14|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weisinger has commented, \&quot;People have always accused me of being an egomaniac as an editor because I always gave the writers my own plots. I did that for a reason. If I asked a writer to bring in his own plots, and he spent a weekend on four of them, and I didn&#39;t like any of the four, then he&#39;s &#39;&#39;wasted&#39;&#39; a whole weekend. . . . . The least I could do was to think of a plot for the writer and if he liked it \u2014 I&#39;d never force it down his throat \u2014 we&#39;d kick it around and evolve a story.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;\n\nOne concept Weisinger brought to comics from the pulps was creating a story \&quot;around a pre-drawn cover,\&quot; a concept taken up across the industry, most notably by colleague Julius Schwartz.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; During Weisinger&#39;s reign, the Superman comics maintained a reasonably tight internal continuity, but related little to the rest of the [[DC Universe]]. Weisinger was succeeded in 1970 by his childhood friend and longtime colleague [[Julius Schwartz]]. Weisinger was later immortalized within the Superman comics \&quot;as a bust in Clark Kent&#39;s apartment.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Articles and books==\nIn addition to his SF agency and extensive editorial work for DC Comics, Weisinger found time - particularly after his retirement from DC - to write a considerable number of articles for a wide variety of magazines. Weisinger was reported, in 1975, as having \&quot;had articles in &#39;&#39;The Journal of the AMA&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Reader&#39;s Digest]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Collier&#39;s]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[The Saturday Evening Post]]&#39;&#39;... [and] &#39;&#39;[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]&#39;&#39;.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; His articles ranged from one on the [[Comics Code]] for &#39;&#39;[[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]]&#39;&#39; to an article entitled \&quot;How Ralph Edwards Fools &#39;Em\&quot; for which he \&quot;accompanied Edwards on several &#39;&#39;This is Your Life&#39;&#39; escapades to get the story of how the clever impresario suckered the celebrities whom he was to honor on his popular &#39;50s show.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;\n\nWeisinger had a particular interest in [[Beauty contest]]s, writing an article for &#39;&#39;Parade&#39;&#39; on \&quot;why certain finalists in the [[Miss America pageant]] can never win the crown,\&quot; as well as a \&quot;best-selling novel\&quot; entitled &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;The Contest&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; (published in hardback by World, and in paperback by [[New American Library]]).&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; Weisinger had once been a \&quot;judge in a preliminary Miss America contest,\&quot; through which he \&quot;learned the inside story,\&quot; later travelling to Europe with the then-\&quot;world-famous host of the real-life contest,\&quot; a friend of Weisinger&#39;s at the time who refused to talk to him again after reading the resulting novel.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; For the author, however, &#39;&#39;The Contest&#39;&#39; netted a $125,000 movie option and \&quot;printings in several foreign languages.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;\n\nWeisinger&#39;s best known book was \&quot;a compendium of freebies available to anyone\&quot; entitled &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;1001 Valuable Things You Can Get For Free&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;, first published in 1955 and which (as of 1975) had \&quot;gone through 41 paperback printings and sold over three million copies.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt; Weisinger&#39;s book was praised by [[Abbie Hoffman]] in &#39;&#39;[[Steal This Book]]&#39;&#39;, and earned its author a place in \&quot;Who&#39;s Who\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Amazing\&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Later life==\nWeisinger lived for much of his life in [[Great Neck, New York]], and stayed there until his death from a heart attack. In 1985, he was posthumously named as one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company&#39;s 50th anniversary publication &#39;&#39;[[Fifty Who Made DC Great]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = Marx, Barry| cowriters = [[Joey Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Joey]] and Hill, Thomas| artist = Petruccio, Steven | editor = Marx, Barry| story = Mort Weisinger The Superman Legend Grows| title = Fifty Who Made DC Great| date = 1985| publisher = DC Comics| page = 23| panel = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Moskowitz, Sam. &#39;&#39;Seekers of Tomorrow: Masters of Modern Science Fiction.&#39;&#39; World Publishing, Cleveland, Ohio, 1996.
