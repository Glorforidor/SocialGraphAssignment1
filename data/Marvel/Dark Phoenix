It was written by [[Chris Claremont]] with art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].\n\nIt is sometimes divided into two parts, with the \"Phoenix Saga\" (''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #101-108, 1976\u20131977, with art by [[Dave Cockrum]] and Byrne) referring to Grey's seeming assumption of the Phoenix power and the repair of the [[M'Kraan Crystal]], and the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" (''Uncanny X-Men'' #129-138, 1980) referring to her corruption and fall. It is one of the most well-known and heavily referenced stories in mainstream American superhero comics, and widely considered a classic.<ref name=\"Deeley\">{{Cite web | last=Deeley | first=Michael | url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/soapbox/99272726322238.htm | title=Silver Soapbox: Dark Phoenix: The Director's Cut | work=[[Comics Bulletin]] | date=June 16, 2001 | accessdate=2009-04-12}}</ref>\n\nIt was adapted for the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series, and alluded to in the live-action movie ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]''. A third live-action movie, ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', released in 2006, contains some elements from the saga. The animated series ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' adapted \"the Dark Phoenix\" saga at the end of its first season, though it changed many elements of the story.\n\nHad there been a fifth season of the animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', its own version of the four-part ''Dark Phoenix'' would have been adapted. The 2019 live-action [[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]] film ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' is an adaptation of the Hellfire arc of the story.\n\n==Summary==\nReturning from a mission in  space, Jean Grey is exposed to the deadly radiation of a solar flare, and briefly attains her ultimate potential as a telepath and telekinetic. Jean becomes a being of pure thought, and then re-forms herself upon return to Earth with the new costume, identity and power of \"[[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]\".<ref>''X-Men'' #101 (Oct. 1976)</ref> It is with this incredible power that Jean repairs the fractured [[M'Kraan Crystal]], but voluntarily restrains her powers afterward in order to keep them under control.<ref>''X-Men'' #107\u2013108 (Oct. \u2013 Dec. 1977)</ref>\n\nHer vast potential makes her a target for [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], who is attempting to prove himself in order to join the prestigious Inner Circle of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Under the identity of Jason Wyngarde, he begins to seduce Jean. With the help of a mind-tap device created by the Club's White Queen, [[Emma Frost]], Mastermind projects his illusions directly into Phoenix's mind. These illusions cause her to believe that she is reliving the memories of an ancestor, [[Jean Grey#Ancestry|Lady Grey]], who in Mastermind's illusions was the Hellfire Club's Black Queen and the lover of one of Wyngarde's ancestors. Phoenix eventually accepts the Black Queen as her actual identity, a decadent role that allows her to relish the extremes of human emotion and begins to break down the barriers that she had erected.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #132 (April 1980)</ref>\n\nShe helps the Hellfire Club capture the [[X-Men]], and Jean's true love [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] faces Mastermind in a psychic duel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #133 (May 1980)</ref> When Mastermind kills Cyclops' psychic image, it breaks his hold over Jean's psyche and shatters the final barriers on her power. Experiencing this power in its totality overwhelms Jean, and she renames herself \"Dark Phoenix\". Enraged at Mastermind, she uses a telepathic illusion to make him experience godhood, driving him insane.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #134 (June 1980)</ref> To break her ties with her less powerful identity as Jean Grey, she strikes down the X-Men and departs for a distant galaxy. However, her power proves to be far more limited than she thought; the intergalactic trip leaves her almost completely drained. To recharge, she devours the energy of the nearby [[D'Bari]] star, causing a [[supernova]] which kills the entire population of the only civilized planet orbiting the star. A [[Shi'ar]] vessel attacks to prevent her from destroying other stars. Dark Phoenix easily destroys the vessel, but not before they alert the Shi'ar Empress [[Lilandra]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #135 (July 1980)</ref> A council of intergalactic associates is gathered, including the [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]] empires, and concludes that Dark Phoenix is an even more serious threat than the planet-consuming [[Galactus]] and must be destroyed.\n\nOn Earth, the X-Men are greeted by [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] member (and former X-Man) [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. Dark Phoenix returns to Earth, to her family's home, and finds herself conflicted between her normal feelings for her loved ones and her new destructive impulses as Dark Phoenix. The X-Men attack her but are again defeated. Her mentor, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], arrives, and through a vicious psychic duel, he creates a new set of psychic \"circuit-breakers\" which reduce her to only her original Marvel Girl powers. This allows Jean's normal personality to reassert control.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #136 (August 1980)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Phoenixconsumesstar.png|right|150px|thumb|Phoenix consumes a star, inadvertently killing billions of people.]]\n\nThe Shi'ar abduct the X-Men, tell them of Dark Phoenix' casual [[genocide]], and declare that she must be put to death. Xavier challenges Lilandra to Arin'n Haelar, a Shi'ar duel of honor that cannot be refused. After conferring with the Kree and Skrulls, Lilandra agrees to Xavier's demand.\n\nThe next day, the X-Men and the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Shi'ar Imperial Guard]] are teleported to the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] to do battle, with the victors deciding the fate of Phoenix. The Imperial Guard defeat most of the X-Men, leaving Cyclops and Phoenix alone to make a final stand. When Cyclops is seemingly killed, Jean's panic overrides Xavier's psychic restraints and restores her to Dark Phoenix. Lilandra initiates Plan Omega, which would consist of destroying the whole [[solar system]] in hopes of eliminating Dark Phoenix in the process. Xavier orders the X-Men to subdue Jean to preempt Lilandra's emergency measure. They battle her until she regains her senses. Running inside one of the Blue Area's ruins, Jean, struggling to keep control, activates an ancient Kree weapon that disintegrates her after an emotional good-bye to Cyclops. He deduces that Jean had planned her sacrifice from the moment they had landed on the moon.<ref name=\"XMen137\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #137 (Sept. 1980)</ref>\n\nThe story ends with [[Uatu]] the Watcher commenting that \"Jean Grey could have lived to become a god. But it was more important to her that she die...a human.\"<ref name=\"XMen137\"/>\n\n==Background and creation==\n[[Image:Uncanny136.jpg|thumb|left|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #136. Art by John Byrne.]]\nAccording to Byrne, it had became a problem storywise that Claremont kept writing Phoenix stronger and stronger, making her the dominating element of the X-Men book. [[Steven Grant]] then suggested they should make her a villain to solve the issue, and eventually it seemed like the best solution to get the book back on track.<ref>[http://www.byrnerobotics.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=56241&PN=1&totPosts=35 Byrne Robotics Topic: Chris Claremont Interview]</ref>\n\nThe segment of the saga set at the Hellfire Club (''Uncanny X-Men'' #132\u2013134) was heavily inspired by the ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|Avengers]]'' television episode \"[[A Touch of Brimstone]]\", and some of the characters' appearances were modeled after the cast of \"A Touch of Brimstone\" as a subtle acknowledgment of the inspiration.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brian Cronin |url= https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-44/|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #44! |website=CBR|date=2006-03-30 |accessdate=2020-06-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ending of the story was a matter of intense controversy with the editorial staff. Jim Shooter's recollections are that the original intent of the Dark Phoenix storyline was to introduce Dark Phoenix as a cosmic nemesis for the X-Men. This was what had been discussed originally amongst the creative team and Shooter, and this was the story development that had been approved. When ''Uncanny X-Men'' issue 135 was in the final artwork stages, Shooter happened to look at the proofs for the issue and noticed that the story included the destruction of an inhabited solar system, with an explicit mention of billions of lives lost.<ref name=\"Shooter\"/><ref name=\"PhoeTapes\">\"The Dark Phoenix Tapes\", ''Phoenix: The Untold Story'' #1 (April 1984). Note: The indicia lists the publication title as simply ''Phoenix'', with no subtitle.</ref> [[Louise Simonson]] feels it was Shooter's outrage over this plot element which led to him taking editor [[Jim Salicrup]] off the series several issues earlier than he had been scheduled to.<ref name=\"PoorDoug\">{{cite news | last = Grant | first= Paul J. | date = August 1993 | title = Poor Dead Doug, and Other Mutant Memories | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 66\u201369}}</ref>\n\nUpon questioning Salicrup about where the plot went from there, he was told that issue 137 ended with Jean being permanently depowered by the Shi'ar and released into the custody of the X-Men. Shooter disagreed with this development both from a storytelling standpoint as well as, secondarily, a moral standpoint, likening the ending to \"taking the German army away from Hitler and letting him go back to governing Germany,\" and finding it out of character for the X-Men to retain friendly relations with a being who had committed genocide.<ref name=\"Shooter\">{{Cite web | last=Shooter | first=Jim | url=http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/06/origin-of-phoenix-saga.html| title=The Origin of the Phoenix Saga| work=[[jimshooter.com]] | date=June 2, 2011| accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref> Byrne and Salicrup explained that they had no problem with this resolution because they had always thought of Dark Phoenix as a separate entity who had possessed Jean Grey, with Salicrup drawing an analogy to [[The Exorcist (film)|the film adaptation of ''The Exorcist'']]: \"In the movie there's this little girl who's taken over and several people get killed, but by the end, when the demon's gone no one thinks, 'Let's kill that murderous little girl.'\"<ref name=\"PhoeTapes\"/> However, on reading the issues over they agreed with Shooter that from the reader's perspective, she did not seem to be possessed, and Claremont admitted that while writing the Dark Phoenix Saga he was never clear in his own mind whether Jean Grey was possessed or her actions as Dark Phoenix were her own.<ref name=\"PhoeTapes\"/>\n\nShooter, during a conversation with Claremont, suggested a scenario where Jean would be permanently imprisoned as a compromise, and Claremont responded that such a scenario was unfeasible since in his opinion, the X-Men would want to continually try to rescue Jean from imprisonment. According to Shooter, Claremont out of frustration suggested that they kill off Jean completely. Although Shooter suggests that the proposed plot point was a bluff by Claremont, playing on the unwritten rule that main characters were not to be killed permanently, he accepted it, even over later objections by both Claremont and Byrne. Ultimately, it was decided by Byrne and Claremont to have Jean commit suicide after her Dark Phoenix persona resurfaces at the climax of the fight against the Imperial Guard.<ref name=\"Shooter\"/> Issue 137 was left largely unchanged, but the last five pages were completely rewritten and redrawn for the new ending, and Claremont also took the opportunity to write a second draft of his script.<ref name=\"PhoeTapes\"/> Because of this, comparison of the original and published versions of ''X-Men'' #137 reveals numerous differences in the script with no connection to the ending; for instance, in the original version of the day of rest, the individual X-Men are each thinking of their own personal issues, while the published version shows them reflecting on their decision to protect Jean.\n\nThe original ending ultimately saw print in 1984 in ''Phoenix: The Untold Story''. Besides the original version of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #137, it featured a transcript of a [[Round table (discussion)|round table discussion]] between Claremont, Byrne, Simonson, Salicrup, Shooter, and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]], discussing the story behind the original ending and why it was changed.\n\n==Jean Grey and Phoenix as separate entities==\nShortly before the publication of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #137, future freelance writer [[Kurt Busiek]], then still a college student, heard about the upcoming events through the fan grapevine, as did fellow future comics pros [[Carol Kalish]] (who would go on to head up Marvel's Direct Sales Department for years) and [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]] (artist of the ''Vision and The Scarlet Witch'' 12-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], among others). The three of them also heard that Marvel editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] had declared that Jean Grey could not be revived unless it was done in such a way as to render her guiltless of Dark Phoenix' crimes. Taking this as a creative challenge, all three then-fans decided to come up with their own resurrection scenario. Busiek's involved the discovery that Jean Grey was still on the bottom of [[Jamaica Bay]] in suspended animation following the original shuttle crash and that the Phoenix entity had used her body and mind as a lens, creating an immensely powerful duplicate of Jean, but one which grew more corrupted and distorted the longer it remained separate from the true Jean.<ref name=\"Cronin\">{{Cite web | last=Cronin | first=Brian | url=https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-29/ | title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #29 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=December 15, 2005 | accessdate=2020-06-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Dark Phoenix resurfaced in the [[DC Comics|DC]]/Marvel [[intercompany crossover]] one-shot ''[[The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans]]'', written by regular ''X-Men'' writer [[Chris Claremont]]. The story (which is not part of DC or Marvel canon) has the cosmic villain [[Darkseid]] resurrect Jean Grey in her Dark Phoenix persona as part of his quest to discover the secret of the [[Anti-Life Equation]]. In the end, Dark Phoenix is betrayed by Darkseid and sacrifices her life yet again to stop Darkseid.\n\nAlso in 1983, shortly after beginning a freelance writing career, Kurt Busiek attended a comics convention in [[Ithaca, New York]], staying at the home of Marvel writer [[Roger Stern]]. In conversation, both writers' longtime interest in the X-Men came up, and Stern expressed regret that there was no way to bring Jean back, not while satisfying Shooter's edict. Busiek told Stern his idea, not expecting it to amount to more than idle conversation. Later, Stern told the idea to [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], then writer/artist of ''Fantastic Four''.<ref name=\"Cronin\"/><ref>{{Cite web | last=Ivery | first=Shane | url=http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=3309 | title=Comics of 1986 #30: ''X-Factor'' | work=Revolution Science Fiction | date=September 12, 2006 | accessdate=2009-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Jim Shooter greenlit a new series that would reunite the original X-Men into a new team called ''[[X-Factor (comics)#X-Factor|X-Factor]]'', to be written by longtime freelancer [[Bob Layton]]. Hearing of this, Byrne called Layton and suggested Busiek's idea as a means of raising Jean Grey from the dead while satisfying Shooter's demands for total absolution for Jean.\n \nA three-part crossover was planned to launch ''X-Factor'', involving the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the Fantastic Four, and the debut issue of ''X-Factor'', thus involving ''Avengers'' writer Stern, ''Fantastic Four'' writer/artist Byrne and ''X-Factor'' writer Layton. Busiek, by that time, was working at Marvel as a freelance assistant editor on ''[[Marvel Age|Marvel Age Magazine]]''. He was paid and credited for the idea,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #286 (Jan. 1986). Busiek's name is misspelled \"Busek\".</ref> and edited a series of interviews for ''Marvel Age'' promoting the new series. Everything in the interviews pertaining to Jean's resurrection was marked out with black tape to create an air of mystery about the revelations that the crossover would involve, and Busiek thus found himself taping over all mention of his idea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comiclist.com/index.php/news/interview-with-kurt-busiek-marathon-man |title=Interview With Kurt Busiek: Marathon Man |publisher=ComicList |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\n''Uncanny X-Men'' #168 (April 1983) began a subplot which culminated with the apparent reincarnation of Dark Phoenix in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #174-175 (October\u2013November 1983). These issues were later collected in trade paperback form under the title ''From the Ashes''.\n\nThe story revolves around Cyclops and the newly introduced [[Madelyne Pryor]], a commercial airline pilot who is not only physically identical to Jean Grey, but survived a traumatic airliner crash at exactly the same moment that Jean died. Pryor's transformation into Dark Phoenix is revealed to be an illusion by [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], seeking revenge for what Jean Grey did to him during \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\". In issue #175, Cyclops and Madelyne repeat the dialogue he exchanged with Jean Grey after Professor X locked away her Dark Phoenix powers, marking the parallel with the dissolving of Mastermind's Dark Phoenix illusion.\n\n==Collected editions==\n\nThe story (issues #129-137) was first collected as a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] in 1984. The first edition featured a cover painting by [[Bill Sienkiewicz]].\n\nTo celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Phoenix Saga, the storyline was reprinted in an oversized trim hardcover. The ''X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga'' hardcover (352 pages, July 2010, Marvel, {{ISBN|978-0-7851-4913-2}}) collects ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #129-138, ''Classic X-Men'' #43, ''Bizarre Adventures'' #27, ''Phoenix: The Untold Story'' (one-shot), and ''What If?'' #27.<ref>{{Cite journal | date=April 28, 2010 | title=Marvel Collected Editions | journal=Marvel Previews | location=New York, NY | publisher=Marvel Worldwide, Inc. | issue=81 | pages=3, 91}}</ref>\n\nThe story (''The X-Men'' #129-137) has been collected into a number of trade paperbacks:\n* ''X-Men Legends, Volume 2: Dark Phoenix Saga'' (192 pages, August 1990, Marvel, {{ISBN|0-7851-1147-6}})\n* ''X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga'' (200 pages, April 2006, Marvel, {{ISBN|0-7851-2213-3}})\n\nThe story is also included in ''Essential X-Men, Volume 2'' (584 pages, October 1997, [[Panini Comics]], {{ISBN|978-0-7851-0298-4}}), part of Marvel's ''[[Essential Marvel|Essential]]'' series of [[black-and-white]] trade paperbacks. The volume collects ''The X-Men'' #120-144 and ''The X-Men Annual'' #3-4.\n\nThe story is included in the hardcover ''[[Marvel Masterworks]]: Uncanny X-Men, Volume 4'' (''The X-Men'' #122-131, ''Annual'' #3) and ''Volume 5'' (''The X-Men'' #132-140, ''Annual'' #4)\n\nThe opening of the story is in the final pages of ''Uncanny X-Men Omnibus, Volume 1'', which includes ''Giant-Size Uncanny X-Men'' #1, ''The X-Men Annual'' #3, and ''The X-Men'' #94-131; it concludes in ''Uncanny X-Men Omnibus Volume 2'', which continues through issue 153 and also includes ''Annual'' #4\u20135, ''Avengers Annual'' #10, ''Marvel Fanfare'' #1\u20134, ''Marvel Treasury Edition'' #26\u201327, ''Marvel Team-Up'' #100, ''Bizarre Adventures'' #27, and ''Phoenix: The Untold Story''.\n\nThe saga was printed in hardback form for issue 2 of [[The Official Marvel Graphic Novel Collection]], a graphic novel series based in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, in January 2012.\n\nAnother omnibus edition, ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix Saga Omnibus'', was published in August 2018, and included ''Uncanny X-Men'' #97\u2013105, 107\u2013108, 125\u2013138, ''Bizarre Adventures'' #27, ''Phoenix: The Untold Story'', ''What If?'' #27, and material from ''Classic X-Men'' #6, 8, 13, 18, 24, 43 (688 pages, {{ISBN|978-1302912123}})\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* ''The Dark Phoenix Saga'', along with the ''Phoenix Saga'', was adapted in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]''. During the five-part ''Phoenix Saga'', the [[X-Men]] had to help the [[Shi'ar]] fight [[Lilandra]]'s deranged brother, [[D'Ken]]. [[Jean Grey]]'s psionic powers of telekinesis, empathy and telepathy all manifest to tremendously incalculable power-levels during the four-part ''Dark Phoenix'' saga, turning her against her comrades. The X-Men, with the help of the Shi'ar, finally succeed in the [[Dark Phoenix]] learning the error of her ways and leaving Jean's body to parts unknown.\n* The Dark Phoenix Saga was foreshadowed in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''. In \"Power Surge\", Jean loses controls of her powers, making her dangerous around others. At the end of the episode, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] absorbed some of Jean's mind, defeating her. At the end of the series, [[Professor Xavier]] saw Jean transforming into the [[Dark Phoenix]] when he was under [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s control. The ''Dark Phoenix'' saga was going to be adapted in four episodes of Season Five. However, the saga did not appear after the series was cancelled in 2003.\n* In ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', the ''Dark Phoenix'' saga was adapted at the three-part season finale \"Foresight\". In the three-part episode \"Foresight\", the [[Hellfire Club]] kidnaps Jean after the X-Men saved her from the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. Wolverine finds out [[Emma Frost]] was in league with the Hellfire Club and locks her in a containment unit. [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] releases Frost, enraging Wolverine. While the X-Men go to [[Genosha]] to fight the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]]s, Frost tells Jean about the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. Later, Frost tells Cyclops of Jean's whereabouts when the X-Jet was crashed by the Sentinels. The two go to Jean's location, where the Hellfire Club betrays Frost and imprisons them. [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] reveals to Cyclops that Frost was the one who triggered Jean's dormant Phoenix abilities when the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]] was destroyed. After the Hellfire Club is defeated at the hands of Jean, she and Scott leave Frost. After saving the X-Men from the [[Mutant Response Division]], Wolverine finds Frost at the Club's hideout. Reluctantly, he releases her, and the two go to find Scott and Jean. After [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and the Sentinels are defeated, Jean unleashes the Phoenix Force. Frost absorbs the Phoenix Force into her body, seemingly killing her in the process.\n\n===Film===\n* The Dark Phoenix Saga is alluded in ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]''; as Jean's powers expand, flash can occasionally be seen in her eyes. After Jean supposedly dies while protecting her teammates from drowning, an image of a phoenix can be seen on the surface of Alkali Lake.\n* The plot of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' contains elements of the Dark Phoenix Saga. In this film, the Phoenix is a [[Dissociative identity disorder|dual personality]] of Jean, which Professor X had telepathically repressed during her childhood, fearing its destructive potential. It is awakened after Jean cocoons herself in telekinetic energy to survive the collapse of Alkali Lake. The Phoenix behaves irresponsibly, has no control over her decision-making, exposes her sexual desires for Wolverine, sides with Magneto and even murders Professor X and Cyclops. The Phoenix is destroyed when Jean is euthanized by Wolverine.\n* The Dark Phoenix Saga is alluded to in ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''; in the final battle against Apocalypse, Professor X encourages Jean to use the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|full extent]] of her abilities to defeat Apocalypse. As Jean unleashes her powers, she is engulfed in an aura of flames in the shape of a phoenix.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/xmen-apocalypse-movie-easter-eggs/?view=all|title=X-Men: Apocalypse Easter Eggs & Secret Details|author=Andrew Dyce|date=May 28, 2016|website=ScreenRant|access-date=August 24, 2017}}</ref>\n* Prior to the release of ''X-Men: Apocalypse'', [[Simon Kinberg]] talked about redoing the Dark Phoenix Saga storyline in a future X-Men film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Rebooting-Dark-Phoenix-Saga-Here-What-Simon-Kinberg-Says-106727.html|title=Rebooting The Dark Phoenix Saga?

Her teammates succeed in blowing the make-up off her to return her to herself.\n*One panel featuring the destruction of the D'Bari system is replicated in the [[DC Comics|DC]]/[[Hanna-Barbera]] crossover ''Superman/Top Cat Special'' (October 2018). This is employed as an ironic twist, since it coincides with the relocation of an alien - the last survivor of his species - to D'Bari by [[Superman]] to give him a new, peaceful home.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1980s}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=storyarc|id=101|title=Dark Phoenix Saga}}\n* [[MarvelDatabase:Dark Phoenix]]\n* [[MarvelDatabase:Character Gallery Dark Phoenix]]\n\n{{X-Comics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dark Phoenix Saga}}\n[[Category:Comics by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Comics by John Byrne]]\n[[Category:Comics adapted into films]]"}]}}}}
