This series reveals that the Forever People were Earth-born humans \u2014 infants doomed to die but brought to New Genesis instead, gathered to protect the human race. They returned to Earth to oppose &#39;the Darkness&#39;, a sentient but disembodied force of hopelessness. They were aided by a mysterious being Maya who is ultimately revealed to be the consciousness of their Mother Box.\n\nDuring the events of &#39;&#39;[[Death of the New Gods]]&#39;&#39;, one of the miniseries that attempted to lead into &#39;&#39;[[Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39;, the human origin of the Forever People was [[retroactive continuity|retconned]], and it was hinted that the five were to have been the first of the next evolution of the New Gods \u2014 godlings becoming more than the sum of their parts. In the &#39;&#39;Death of the New Gods&#39;&#39;, [[Superman]] and [[Mister Miracle]] discover that the Forever People were murdered several months prior to the discovery of their bodies, and it is later revealed that an impostor posing as [[Himon]] has been murdering the New Gods as an agent for [[Source (comics)|the Source]]; but the murderer turns out to be Infinity Man.\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;Final Crisis Sketchbook&#39;&#39;, the Forever People (along with other members of the New Gods) are shown to be given updated looks, which [[Grant Morrison]] calls \&quot;more gothic art school student than flower power\&quot;.

From top to bottom: Big Bear, Vykin the Black, Mark Moonrider, Beautiful Dreamer, Serifan.&lt;br&gt;Artists: Jack Kirby and Mike Royer]]\n\n===Beautiful Dreamer===\nDuring the original Kirby run, Beautiful Dreamer had been linked romantically to Mark Moonrider, although outside of hand-holding, the exact nature of their relationship was never directly specified. In the 1988 miniseries, it was established that Dreamer had been married to Big Bear, and together they had a child, named Maya after the spirit of their old [[Mother Box]]. Since then, their marriage and daughter has been voided by a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] during [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Fourth World (comics)|Jack Kirby&#39;s Fourth World]]&#39;&#39; series. When last shown, Dreamer was romantically involved with [[Takion]], the new Highfather of New Genesis.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Superman &amp; Batman: Generations]] 3&#39;&#39;, she marries Superman, and has his children, Lar-El and Vara. All three are killed by Darkseid.\n\n====Powers and abilities====\n\nLike all the children of New Genesis, Beautiful Dreamer possesses the advanced physiology of a New God; she is extremely long-lived, has a limited degree of superhuman strength, resistance and reflexes. She&#39;s a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. Also, she has psionic powers, with which she can create illusions. It seems there are no limits to the size or duration of these images. In addition, she has been able to feel the fluctuations within the Source.\n\n===Big Bear===\nBig Bear had been married to Beautiful Dreamer, and she had been pregnant with their daughter. A shift in time resulted in the marriage never happening and the child never having existed. This traumatized Beautiful Dreamer for a time. In &#39;&#39;Forever People&#39;&#39; #7, he was shown to have been responsible for the historical event that led to the legend of [[King Arthur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Kirby, Jack|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Royer, Mike|story= I&#39;ll Find You in Yesterday!!|title= The Forever People|issue= 7|date= February&amp;ndash;March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Powers and abilities====\nA skilled hand-to-hand combatant, Big Bear is among the strongest of the children of New Genesis, making him superstrong by human standards, capable of bending steel and hurling giant redwood trees almost effortlessly. Big Bear&#39;s atomic structure is reinforced by a constant flow of so-called high-density atoms, and he is able to store an excess of free-flowing atoms which he can direct at will to reinforce the power of his already awesome punch.\n\n===Mark Moonrider===\nDuring the original Kirby run, Beautiful Dreamer had been linked romantically to Mark Moonrider, although outside of hand-holding, the exact nature of their relationship was never directly specified. In the 1988 miniseries set on Adon, Mark was shown to have fallen in love with, and later married one of the natives, Mina. They had three children (Merry, Wendy and Starbright), but when the shift in time caused by the Darkness&#39; actions undid the events which &#39;evolved&#39; the natives, this marriage now never had occurred, leaving Mark with only his friends.\n\n====Powers and abilities====\nIn addition to being extremely long-lived, Mark has superhuman strength, reflexes and he&#39;s very resistant to conventional injury. Also, he has a keen mind with good leadership skills and he is well-trained in hand-to-hand combat. He possesses a &#39;&#39;&#39;Megaton Touch&#39;&#39;&#39;. With it, he can cause a tremendous explosion, and no doubt he could easily kill with it if he and his companions were not sworn never to take a life. Used at low intensity, it can cause a severe shock. On one occasion he used his megaton touch to turn solid rock into molten lava.\n\n===Serifan===\nSerifan is the youngest member of the group. He&#39;s usually the most vulnerable. The Dark saw this and possessed Serifan, using him to conquer Forevertown and plague the Forever People. After the Dark was defeated he returned to his normal self.\n\n====Powers and abilities====\nAlthough Serifan doesn&#39;t have super-potencies, still he is stronger and more durable than any human. Also, Serifan is functionally a sensitive possessing limited telepathic powers. In his hatband Serifan carries \&quot;cosmic cartridges\&quot; that serve various purposes when fired from his revolver. For example, the cartridges can be used to create a protective shock-repelli-field, drain energy of people, to create an anti-gravity effect, to generate high gravitational force, modify the atomic density, to generate intense heat, to power a vehicle, or to stun an opponent. Also, the cartridges tune the wielder into the \&quot;cosmic Harmony\&quot; that is linked to [[The Source (comics)|the Source]] and, in the case of the \&quot;Blue Cartridge\&quot;, it manipulates the life force and allowed [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] to merge with a \&quot;Follower\&quot; and have a body of his own once again.\n\n===Vykin===\nThroughout the Kirby run, Vykin was referred to as \&quot;Vykin the Black\&quot;. He was the first [[Black people|black]] superhero to appear in a DC comic book, preceding Kirby&#39;s [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] by approximately seven months. When the Forever People were stranded on Adon, Mark Moonrider thought it would be advantageous to civilize the people of the planet. When Vykin used their [[Mother Box]] to do so, it overloaded and was destroyed, killing Vykin in the process, but managing to create &#39;&#39;&#39;Forevertown&#39;&#39;&#39;. When the Dark overtook and reversed the effects of the Mother Box, Vykin was brought back to life. Recently he was reunited on New Genesis with his mother, Valkyra the Commander, who rode a winged robotic horse. Later on, she sacrificed her life to save her lover [[Orion (comics)|Orion]].\n\n====Powers and abilities====\nLike all New gods, Vykin The Black is functionally immortal and all his physical attributes are superhuman. Also, Vykin The Black possesses \&quot;Magno-Power\&quot;, which enables him to project magnetic energy. He can mentally trace atomic patterns, and is therefore good at tracking. Vykin has a keen mind and he&#39;s a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. It is Vykin who carries the Forever People&#39;s Mother Box, a kind of [[sentience|sentient]] computer.\n\n===Infinity-Man===\n[[Infinity-Man]] is Drax, the older brother of Uxas, who would later become [[Darkseid]] of Apokolips, and became the Infinity-Man after treachery at the hands of Uxas while attempting to harness the &#39;&#39;&#39;Omega Force&#39;&#39;&#39; for himself. No explanation was given as to why he was involved with the Forever People other than Big Bear&#39;s offhanded comment to [[Superman]] in the first issue of \&quot;we&#39;ve got an arrangement with the Infinity Man\&quot;.
