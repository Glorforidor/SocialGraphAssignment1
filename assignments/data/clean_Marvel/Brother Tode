They appeared in the Eternals' series Volume 1 and 2. Recently, they appeared in Thor: The Deviants Saga#1-5 (2012) written by Robert Kodi and illustred by Steven Segovia.\n\n\n== Fictional history ==\nThey are an offshoot of the evolutionary process that created sapient life on Earth instigated by the alien Celestials, and wage war against their counterparts, the Eternals. According to the account of one Deviant in the 2006 comic book mini-series, the Deviants were created as a delicacy to be consumed en masse by Celestials at periodic intervals once they multiplied sufficiently. The veracity of this has yet to be proven.\nWhile the Eternals possess godlike power and are generally physically beautiful (by human standards), the Deviants (who sometimes refer to themselves as 'the changing people') are for the most part hideous (again, by human standards), with each member of their race possessing some random physical and/or cosmetic mutation that is by Celestial design never repeated within the sub-species. Extremely mutated or deformed Deviants are referred to as \"mutates\" and some of the monsters of myth and legend have in fact been identified as Deviant mutates. Some of these mutations can provide superhuman abilities, but their powers are usually not as great as those of the Eternals.\nThe Deviants are religious, revering the Dreaming Celestial (\"He Who Sleeps in Darkness\"). They credit him with their creation and claim that he granted them dominion over the Earth, an agreement they believe was later broken by the treachery of the other Celestials. They have one or more holy books\u2014the only one named thus far being the Book of Krask.\nThe Deviants had already developed advanced technology such as genetic engineering when humans were still living in caves.\nAt some point in prehistoric times, some Deviants chased after Vnn and his lover Brrkk. When Brrkk died, Vnn found the corpse of a Tyrannosaurus that previously possessed the Star Brand. Vnn absorbed the Star Brand powers and used them to defeat the Deviants.In the advent of the heroic age, Brother Tode was leading the Deviants, with his capital in the city of the Toads in the sunken continent of Lemuria. When the Fourth  Celestial Host arrived to Earth, deviant's soldiers led by Warlord Kro attacked New York City in an attempt to provoke fear in the humans and trick them into attacking the Celestials .  When this attempt failed, the Deviants sent an attack team to the Celestial spaceship, which failed too.Later, the Deviant's aristocracy, led by  Brother Tode , attacked Olympia, kidnapped the Eternals with the intent to disintegrate them. However, the hero Iron Man (James Rhodes) rescued the Eternals and helped them in the defeat of the deviants. The Eternals transformed the deviant's aristocracy into a synthetic cube, killing them.  Only Warlord Kro escaped with the help of his old lover Thena of the Eternals.\nWithout the aristocracy, the deviant's priests seized power, led by Priestlord Ghaur, who killed the son of Tode, Ranar. Kro returned to Lemuria and was crowned as a figurehead monarch, with the real power in the hands of Ghaur.  With their new leader, the Deviants battled the Eternals again. Ghaur absorbed the power of the Dreaming Celestial and tried to ascend to godhood, but was defeated by the Eternals and the Avengers (comics) and was disintegrated. Kro was left as king of the deviants. Ghaur returned to corporeal form and tried to obtain the Serpent Crown with help of the Atlantean Lemurians, led by Llyra, in an attempt to invoke the Old God Set.  The Avengers and Fantastic Four put an end to their mad plan and Ghaur was disintegrated once more.  Without Ghaur, and with the abdication of Kro, the deviant society fall into anarchy and revolution. Brother Visara led them in killing all the leaders and their followers. He was ultimately killed as well.Later, Kro led a group of  heroic Deviants, the Delta Network to rescue the Avengers from a resurrected Ghaur, who used his powers to control the deviants once more. Ghaur and the Deviants fought the Eternals and the Heroes for Hire, when the mad priest created an Anti-Mind in his plan to rule the world.Kro and Ghaur formed bickering factions and kept the struggle for power in Deviant Lemuria. The external world didn't know who was in charge. Much later, the Deviants males were rendered sterile by a plague, the anarchy reigned,  and a power contest between Ereshkigal (comics) and Ghaur happened. Ghaur won when he promised the deviants the return of the fertility with the help of the kidnapped eternal Phastos. The Asgardian god Thor rescued Phastos and battled Ghaur. When the  Unbiding stone (an adoomsday artifact stolen by Erishkigal) was destroyed, Ghaur and Erishkigal disappeared and Kro was left leading the Deviants.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n=== Deviants ===\nA deviant is a modified human with unstable genetics, that provokes different forms and abilities.\n\nKro \u2013 A Deviant Warlord who is the ruler of Lemuria and head of the Delta Network.
