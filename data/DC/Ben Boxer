The bulk of Kamandi&#39;s appearances occurred in the comic series &#39;&#39;Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth&#39;&#39;, which ran from 1972 to 1978.\n\nKamandi is a young hero in a [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future. After a huge event called \&quot;The Great Disaster\&quot;, humans have been reduced back to savagery in a world ruled by intelligent, highly evolved animals.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Creators===\nDC editor [[Carmine Infantino]] had tried to acquire the license to publish &#39;&#39;[[Planet of the Apes (comics)|Planet of the Apes]]&#39;&#39; comic books. When this failed to happen, he asked [[Jack Kirby]] for a series with a similar concept. Kirby had not seen the films but he knew the rough outline and he had also created a very similar story, \&quot;The Last Enemy!\&quot;, in [[Harvey Comics]]&#39; &#39;&#39;[[Alarming Tales]]&#39;&#39; that predated the original &#39;&#39;[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]&#39;&#39; novel. He also had an unused comic strip he created in 1956, titled &#39;&#39;Kamandi of the Caves&#39;&#39;. Kirby brought all those elements together to create &#39;&#39;Kamandi&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 153|quote = Kirby had already introduced a similar concept and characters in &#39;&#39;Alarming Tales&#39;&#39; #1 (1957)...Coupling the premise with his unpublished \&quot;Kamandi of the Caves\&quot; newspaper strip, Kirby&#39;s Last Boy on Earth roamed a world that had been ravaged by the \&quot;Great Disaster\&quot; and taken over by talking animals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his initial plan was to not work on the comic books themselves, the cancellation of &#39;&#39;[[Forever People]]&#39;&#39; freed him up to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian|last=Cronin |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/02/18/comic-book-legends-revealed-248/|title= Comic Book Legends Revealed #248 |publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|date=February 18, 2010|accessdate=May 27, 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101001114743/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/02/18/comic-book-legends-revealed-248/|archivedate=October 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The series===\nThe &#39;&#39;Kamandi&#39;&#39; series was launched in October&amp;ndash;November 1972, and was written and drawn by [[Jack Kirby]].&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book went to a monthly publishing schedule quickly, a sign of its early popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nKirby provided art and story through the comic&#39;s 37th issue, in January 1976. Kirby also drew issues #38 through #40, although they were scripted by [[Gerry Conway]]. Kirby subsequently left DC, but the series continued, initially written by Conway and drawn by Chic Stone. Later issues were alternately written by [[Paul Levitz]], [[Dennis O&#39;Neil]], [[David Anthony Kraft]], [[Elliot S. Maggin]], and [[Jack C. Harris]], with art by [[Pablo Marcos]], [[Keith Giffen]], and [[Dick Ayers]]. It was canceled during the \&quot;[[DC Implosion]]\&quot; of 1978, despite respectable sales figures. The final published issue was #59, cover-dated September&amp;ndash;October 1978. Two additional issues, completed but not released, were included in &#39;&#39;[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]&#39;&#39; #2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/32652/ &#39;&#39;Cancelled Comic Cavalcade&#39;&#39; #2 (Fall 1978)] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Entering the DC Universe===\nDuring Kirby&#39;s run on the book, Steve Sherman indicated in the letters column that the series was connected to Kirby&#39;s contemporary &#39;&#39;[[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]]&#39;&#39; series, which was set sometime prior to the Great Disaster. The only explicit connection to the [[DC Universe]] occurs in issue #29, where Kamandi discovers a group of apes who worship Superman&#39;s costume, and who speak of legends of Superman trying and failing to stop the Great Disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story leaves it ambiguous whether the legends are true, although Kamandi believes Superman was real, and whether the costume is indeed Superman&#39;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]; [[Steve Sherman|Sherman, Steve]]|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[D.

Additional DC promotional art for the series &#39;&#39;[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]&#39;&#39; show the Statue of Liberty in ruins, similar to &#39;&#39;Kamandi&#39;&#39; #1. [[Dan DiDio]] later revealed that the Statue&#39;s appearance in that teaser ad was a reference to the &#39;&#39;[[Sinestro Corps War]]&#39;&#39;. Throughout 2007, DC Comics contained continual references to a coming Great Disaster. In &#39;&#39;Countdown&#39;&#39; #31, Buddy Blank and his unnamed blond grandson are introduced into the storyline. As of &#39;&#39;Countdown&#39;&#39; #6, The Great Disaster is in its early stages on Earth-51 due to the outbreak of a virus, which is causing humans to develop animal-like features, and animals to develop humanoid features. In &#39;&#39;Countdown&#39;&#39; #5, the virus claims Earth-51&#39;s Buddy Blank&#39;s daughter, but his grandson is safe. Una, an alternate Earth&#39;s version of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] [[Luornu Durgo|Triplicate Girl]], gives him her Legion flight ring, which he uses to safely get him to [[Cadmus]]&#39; \&quot;Command D\&quot; facility, which was used to control [[OMAC (comics)|Brother Eye]], and has the defenses necessary to protect them from the virus&#39;  victims. As he settles in, he hopes that his grandson can forgive him for making him \&quot;the last boy on Earth\&quot;.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Countdown: Arena]]&#39;&#39; #2, an ape Starman from Earth-17 mentions he is attempting to form a truce between the forces of Kamandi and Ben Boxer, indicating a second variant Kamandi Earth, unlike Earth-51.\n\nKamandi and [[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]] appear in \&quot;Devil&#39;s Play\&quot; written by [[Joe Kubert]] and [[Brandon Vietti]] with art by Vietti, published in &#39;&#39;Joe Kubert Presents&#39;&#39; #6 (May 2013).\n\n===Final Crisis===\n{{Main|Final Crisis}}\nKamandi is seen in DC&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39; [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], a sequel to the earlier &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]].&#39;&#39;  In the first issue he appears in what seems to be a time distortion, asking [[Anthro (comics)|Anthro]], the \&quot;first\&quot; boy on Earth, for the weapon the New God [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] gave him, a reference to the series&#39; opening scene in which Anthro, like [[Prometheus]], is given knowledge in the form of fire.

(After Disaster)\&quot;. The Earth has been ravaged by a mysterious calamity called the Great Disaster. The precise nature of the Great Disaster is never revealed in the original series, although it \&quot;had something to do with radiation\&quot; (in the series&#39; letter column, Jack Kirby and his then-assistant [[Steve Sherman]] repeatedly asserted that the Great Disaster was not a nuclear war, a fact confirmed in issue #35). The Disaster wiped out human civilization and a substantial portion of the human population. A few isolated pockets of humanity survived in underground bunkers, while others quickly reverted to pre-technological savagery.\n\nShortly before the Great Disaster, a scientist at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]], Dr. Michael Grant, developed a drug called Cortexin, which stimulated the reasoning abilities of animals. During the Great Disaster, Grant released the experimental animals affected by the drug, and dumped the Cortexin itself into the stream created by a broken water main. In the ensuing days, animals escaping from the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]] drank from that stream and became affected by the drug.\n\nBy Kamandi&#39;s time, an unspecified period after the Great Disaster, the effects of Cortexin and the radiation unleashed by the Great Disaster itself had caused a wide variety of animals (most of them are descendants of escaped zoo animals following the disaster) including but not limited to [[barracuda]]s, [[bat]]s, [[cheetah]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[dog]]s, [[gopher]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[kangaroo]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[lion]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[Cougar|puma]]s, [[rat]]s, [[sloth]]s, [[tiger]]s, and [[Gray wolf|wolves]], to become bipedal, humanoid, and sentient, possessing the power of speech. Others animals ranging from [[dolphin]]s, [[killer whale]]s, and [[snake]]s developed sentience, but retained more or less their original size and form. The newly intelligent animal species, equipped with weapons and technology salvaged from the ruins of human civilization, began to struggle for territory. [[Horse]]s were apparently not affected, and serve as a means of transportation in the technologically impoverished world of Earth A.D.\n\nBy this time, most surviving humans are acting bestial, with very limited reasoning ability. Most have only the most rudimentary ability to speak, although they can be trained. The precise cause of the loss of reasoning ability is ambiguous in the original series. The animals treat humans as beasts, using them for labor or as pets.\n\nKamandi is the last survivor of the human outpost in the \&quot;Command D\&quot; bunker near what was once New York City. \&quot;Kamandi\&quot; is a corruption of \&quot;Command D\&quot;; it is unclear if Kamandi ever had any other name. Raised by his elderly grandfather, Kamandi has extensive knowledge of the pre-Disaster world, thanks to a library of [[microfilm]] and old videos, but he has spent most of his time inside the bunker, and is unaware of the state of the world outside. When his grandfather is killed by a wolf, Kamandi leaves the bunker in search of other human outposts.\n\nHe soon discovers that the only other intelligent humans left on Earth are [[Ben Boxer]] and his friends Steve and Renzi, a trio of mutants genetically engineered to survive in Earth A.D. He also makes a number of animal friends including Dr. Canus, the canine scientist of Great Caesar (leader of the Tiger Empire) and Caesar&#39;s teenage son Tuftan. Later additions to the cast included the alien woman Pyra, the girl Spirit and the consulting detective Mylock Bloodstalker and his associate Doile. Even the most sympathetic animals, however, are nonplussed by Kamandi and Ben&#39;s ability to speak.\n\nKamandi and his friends set out to explore the world of Earth A.D., in hopes of one day restoring humanity to sentience and civilization.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Elseworlds===\nThe [[Elseworlds]] miniseries &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Kamandi: At Earth&#39;s End&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; was issued in 1993, but had little relation to the Kirby comic except by name. This series was followed up by &#39;&#39;[[Superman: At Earth&#39;s End]]&#39;&#39;, both written by [[Tom Veitch]].\n\n===Superman/Batman===\nIn the third story arc of the &#39;&#39;[[Superman/Batman]]&#39;&#39; series, which showed the heroes traveling through time, they met or fought with, variously, [[Sgt.
