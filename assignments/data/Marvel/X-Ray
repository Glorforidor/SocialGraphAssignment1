They are usually depicted as enemies of the [[Hulk]]. The group consists of four members: &#39;&#39;&#39;Vector&#39;&#39;&#39; as the group&#39;s leader who can repel matter telekinetically; &#39;&#39;&#39;Vapor&#39;&#39;&#39; who can transform into any form of gaseous matter; &#39;&#39;&#39;X-Ray&#39;&#39;&#39; who can generate and project radiation and fly; and &#39;&#39;&#39;Ironclad&#39;&#39;&#39; who has a metallic body and can control his density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Publication history==\nThe U-Foes first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]&#39;&#39; #254 (December 1980) and were created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Sal Buscema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per &#39;&#39;The Incredible Hulk&#39;&#39; #254 credits, editor [[Al Milgrom]] designed the costumes of the U-Foes while editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] helped with the names of the U-Foes.\n\nAs noted on the first page of that issue, the group&#39;s name was inspired by the 1979 [[Graham Parker]] song \&quot;Waiting for the UFOs\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date = 2008|page = 199|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Inspired by the 1979 Graham Parker song &#39;&#39;Waiting for the UFOs&#39;&#39;, the creation of the U-Foes was truly a team effort. Writer Bill Mantlo and artist Sal Buscema produced the first U-Foes story, but editor Al Milgrom helped design the costumes and Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter suggested some of the names.}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fictional team biography==\nSimon Utrecht, a former politician and multi-millionaire, funds an operation to gain superpowers the same way the [[Fantastic Four]] had, by flying into space and being exposed to cosmic rays. He chooses three other members to join him: Ann Darnell, Jimmy Darnell, and Mike Steel. What the group did not know was that they would be exposed to much higher amount than the Fantastic Four and that it would most likely kill them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bray |first1=Adam |last2=Cink |first2=Lorraine |last3=Scott |first3=Melanie |last4=Wiacek |first4=Win |title=Ultimate Marvel |date=2017 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-1465455727 |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hulk, in his Bruce Banner form, brings the ship down by reprogramming their computer before the group was exposed to the terminal levels of cosmic rays. The group did manage to gain powers and the newly christened U-Foes attacked Banner for interfering, convinced they could have become even more powerful without his intervention. Banner transforms into the Hulk and a fight ensues, but the U-Foes lose due to their inexperience with their newly gained powers and inability to fight as a team. In the end, their own ongoing mutations incapacitate them, and the team is scattered as they lose control of their increasing abilities.\n\nSome time later, as their powers stabilize, the U-Foes reunite with the goal of revenge and making a name for themselves in the public eye by killing the Hulk. Though they find the Hulk a more formidable foe, with the intelligence of Bruce Banner then in control of the Hulk, X-ray discovers a way to keep Banner in his human form by generating &#39;anti-gamma rays&#39;. The U-Foes imprison Banner at the former Gamma Base and hijack television broadcasts worldwide, intending to gain infamy by killing Banner in front of the world. However, Banner is freed by his allies [[Betty Ross]], [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], and [[Bereet]], and defeats the U-Foes as the Hulk. Ironically, the U-Foes&#39; attempt to gain fame at the Hulk&#39;s expense instead reveals to the world that Banner is in control of the Hulk&#39;s power, and leads to a brief period of Banner/Hulk as a popular celebrity and true superhero (ending when the savage Hulk persona re-asserts itself).\n\nAfter several defeats at the hands of the Hulk and his allies, each of the U-Foes are banished to a different dimension.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Incredible Hulk&#39;&#39; #304-305 (Feb.-March 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; They manage to reunite and find their way back to Earth when the mutant [[Portal (comics)|Portal]]&#39;s powers began manifesting. The U-Foes attempt to murder Portal to keep him from opening another portal to banish them, but are defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. They later attempt to kidnap Portal to exploit his mutant powers, and are defeated once again by [[Captain America]], [[Darkhawk]], and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s the team generally work alone, but occasionally work as hired hands for other villains. Working for the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], they attack the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], injuring dozens of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Incredible Hulk&#39;&#39; #397&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the handicap of an orphan girl who had gotten mixed up in the battle, the Hulk and the Pantheon soldiers manage to subdue some of the U-Foes. The villains are tricked into hurting each other. During the Acts of Vengeance, the U-Foes face the West Coast Avengers with the help of the Mole Man, but they are defeated.\n\nAround this time, they play an important part in [[Vault (comics)|The Vault]] prison breakout in \&quot;[[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] Deathrap; The Vault\&quot;. The various U-Foes work together and with other villains to fight against the prison&#39;s security, its forces, [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The U-Foes and other prisoners are neutralized by technological mind-control.\n\nThe team later encounters the Hulk in the Arctic ice fields outside the Leader&#39;s devastated sanctuary for cancer victims. The Hulk, believing he had just lost his friend, intimidates them into fleeing.\n\nBoth of the fights with the Hulk are part of manipulations by the Pantheon&#39;s ancient leader [[Agamemnon (Pantheon)|Agamemnon]]. Neither side realizes the old man is secretly a power-crazed murderous psychotic who enjoys manipulation.\n\nLater, the U-Foes are again part of a breakout from the Vault. During this, they manage to destroy the entire facility.\n\nThe U-Foes also are freed from the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]], when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] breaks them out in the &#39;&#39;New Avengers&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;New Avengers&#39;&#39; vol. 1 #01&lt;/ref&gt; but are distracted from escaping by a confrontation with [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] and his team of mind-controllers\u2014including [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], [[Mister Fear]], [[Corruptor (comics)|Corruptor]] and the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]]\u2014over technology that had been stolen from them, until [[Spider-Man]], Captain America and Iron Man are able to capture them.\n\nDuring the &#39;&#39;[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]&#39;&#39; storyline, the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] brings the U-Foes to the attention of the United States government. The U.S. sends the B-Squad version of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] ([[Blizzard (Donnie Gill)|Blizzard]], [[Joystick (comics)|Joystick]], Fixer and [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]]), after the U-Foes. After a battle in Portland, the U-Foes are arrested.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thunderbolts&#39;&#39; #104&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of [[due process]], they are given the choice of joining the team or facing jail time.\n\nThe U-Foes are among the villains recruited to join [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]&#39;s crime syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;New Avengers&#39;&#39; #32 - 37 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The U-Foes are seen to be among the new recruits for [[Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers: The Initiative&#39;&#39; #25&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the &#39;&#39;[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]&#39;&#39; storyline, the U-Foes are revealed by new Initiative leader [[Norman Osborn]] as the new Initiative team for the state of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers: The Initiative&#39;&#39; #26&lt;/ref&gt; Osborn orders the U-Foes to attack the [[Heavy Hitters (comics)|Heavy Hitters]] after they secede from the Initiative. They help the other Initiative teams to defeat and capture the Heavy Hitters&#39; leader [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers: The Initiative&#39;&#39; #28&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe U-Foes play a role in the beginning of &#39;&#39;[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]&#39;&#39;, when Osborn sends them to fight [[Volstagg]]. The resulting clash leads to Volstagg being (falsely) blamed for destroying [[Soldier Field]] and killing thousands, and giving Osborn the excuse to start a war with Asgard.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Siege #1\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Siege&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of other villains, they bring down Thor after attacked by [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|the Sentry]]. When Osborn is defeated, the whole team surrenders and is then incarcerated.\n\nDuring the \&quot;Opening Salvo\&quot; part of the &#39;&#39;[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]&#39;&#39; storyline, the U-Foes are among the villains recruited by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] to join the Army of Evil.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America: Steve Rogers&#39;&#39; #16&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Members==\n===Vector===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name       = Vector\n|Marvelwiki = Vector\n|CBDBid     = 5278\n|GCDid      = Vector\n}}\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Real Name&#39;&#39;&#39;: Simon Utrecht\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Power&#39;&#39;&#39;: Telekinesis, limited to attract or repel matter from his own body.

She was hired by Simon Utrecht to be the life-support technologist on his space ship.

He was hired by Simon to be the spaceship&#39;s [[Flight controller|fuel-propulsion engineer]].\n\n===Ironclad===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name       = Ironclad\n|Marvelwiki = Ironclad\n|CBDBid     = 5281\n|GCDid      = Ironclad\n}}\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Real Name&#39;&#39;&#39;: Michael \&quot;Mike\&quot; Steel\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Powers&#39;&#39;&#39;: Permanently transformed into organic metal similar to the X-Man [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Superhuman strength, durability, and the ability to increase or decrease his own weight, hovering in the air,&lt;ref name=\&quot;Hulk397\&quot;/&gt; or crushing like a mountain. Ironclad&#39;s form was initially composed of jagged folds of metal; however, after briefly losing control of his weight-altering powers and sinking deep into the Earth&#39;s crust, he emerged with his body smoothed and polished by the friction of his passage.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Background&#39;&#39;&#39;: Michael Steel is a [[scientist]], [[engineer]], and skilled [[Pilot (aircraft)|pilot]]. He was hired by Simon to pilot his spaceship. he helped his comrades defeat their enemies multiple times after he changed to a great team man.\n\n==Other versions==\n===JLA/Avengers===\nIn [[JLA/Avengers]], X-ray is among the enthralled villains defending [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]&#39;s stronghold when the heroes assault it in #4. He is seen fighting [[Captain Atom]].\n\n===[[Ultraverse]]===\nIn Malibu&#39;s Ultraverse, exists a different Ironclad that was part of the New Exiles and [[Ultraforce]].\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The U-Foes appear in &#39;&#39;[[The Avengers: Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes]]&#39;&#39;, with Vector voiced by [[Cam Clarke]] and Vapor voiced by [[Colleen Villard|Colleen O&#39;Shaughnessey]] while X-Ray and Ironclad had no dialogue. In the episode \&quot;Hulk Vs. the World\&quot;, Vapor, Vector, X-Ray cameo the Cube&#39;s inmates while Ironclad was possibly seen from the back (but it is unclear whether or not it was him) but all their blood samples were seen. The U-Foes later return in the episode \&quot;Gamma World\&quot; Pt. 1 to distract the Avengers from destroying the Gamma Dome Generator. The U-Foes&#39; powers are increased by Gamma Boosters made by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. In the end, they are defeated along with the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] and [[Zzzax]] when [[Black Panther (Marvel Comics)|Black Panther]] destroys the generator.\n* The U-Foes appear in &#39;&#39;[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers: Ultron Revolution]]&#39;&#39;, with Vector voiced by Glenn Steimbaum, Vapor voiced by [[Catherine Taber]], X-Ray voiced by [[Jeremy Kent Jackson]], and Ironclad voiced by [[Eric Ladin]]. Backed by [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], four scientists ride a spaceship into a cosmic gamma storm. In their self-titled episode, their spaceship threatens to crash into Vista Verde but the [[Hulk]] ends up redirecting it. Upon emerging from the spaceship, the scientists discover their powers and take the U-Foes name because their spaceship resembled a UFO. Unwittingly mentioning HYDRA&#39;s involvement in front, the Hulk ends up attacking them only to be subdued. Heading to HYDRA&#39;s base, the HYDRA Agents are informed by U-Foes that they will lead HYDRA as the Avengers attack. The U-Foes fight while the HYDRA Agents download everything top secret before escaping. Later on, the U-Foes and HYDRA infiltrate an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. base and steal an old-fashioned [[Helicarrier]]. While preventing the crashlanding Helicarrier from heading into a nuclear power plant, the Avengers trick the U-Foes into going into a room where they were subdued by knockout gas.\n\n===Video games===\n* The U-Foes appear in &#39;&#39;[[The Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/incredible-hulk-the-pantheon-saga The Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga for DOS (1997) - MobyGames]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* The U-Foes appear in &#39;&#39;[[The Incredible Hulk (2008 video game)|The Incredible Hulk]]&#39;&#39;, with Vector voiced by [[S. Scott Bullock]], Vapor voiced by [[Rachael MacFarlane]], X-Ray voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]], and Ironclad voiced by [[Mitch Lewis]]. While Ironclad and Vapor appear virtually identical to their comic book incarnations, X-Ray is presented as glowing green with a silhouette of his skeletal structure visible through his flesh, and Vector retains a normal human appearance rather than being physically transformed. In this version, their original intention was to duplicate the accident that created the Hulk using atmospheric rather than gamma radiation. Their rage is subsequently directed at the Hulk due to him destroying the antenna that was gathering the radiation. The U-Foes attack the Hulk, but he defeats all of them. After the Hulk leaves the area, the U-Foes recover and decide if Hulk interferes with them again, they will kill him. After playing through the initial battle with the U-Foes in the game&#39;s story mode, the villains occasionally appear, individually or in pairs, in different parts of the city as [[random encounter]]s in [[Glossary of video game terms#Sandbox game|sandbox]] mode. Ironclad can also be unlocked as a playable character [[Glossary of video game terms#Skin|skin]] if the player can manipulate one of the other U-Foes (Vector, X-Ray, Vapor) into injuring another during an encounter.\n* The U-Foes are featured in the [[Playdom]] game &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Avengers Alliance]]&#39;&#39; as recurring bosses.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvelwiki}}\n*{{Marveldatabase|U-Foes (Earth-616)|U-Foes}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=team|id=335|title=U-Foes}}\n\n{{Avengers characters}}\n{{Hulk}}\n{{Fifty State Initiative}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1980]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillain teams]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Al Milgrom]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Shooter]]&quot;</span>
