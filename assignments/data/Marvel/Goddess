Agreeing, Thanos first seeks Pip the Troll to teleport to New Krall and then contacts Gamora to also go to Adam, as they both are his closest friends and can keep him from doing any damage to the universe. During this time Annihilus begins a re-invasion of the Positive Zone searching for an immense power source that turns out to be Adam himself and launches a devastating siege on New Krall. The Shi&#39;ar, led by [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] (also looking for the power source), appear and Annihilus, now with the power of the Hulk and a new fear projection ability, defeats them.

Pip stays behind, stating Adam is his only friend and he will not abandon him. The comatose Adam is placed into Annihilus&#39; ship&#39;s power source to use him as battery. Pip, after hiding on Annihilus&#39; ship for three months, finds the comatose Adam and launches a rescue mission, killing his guards and striking Adam repeatedly to waken him. Finally awakening, Adam unconsciously destroys the universe and is left floating in a void. Panicking, Adam calls out for Thanos and wills the Titan back into existence. Thanos then proposes to Adam a plan to beseech the [[One Above All]] to recreate the universe. The One Above All agrees, on the condition Adam act as the universe&#39;s new [[Living Tribunal]]. Adam and Thanos restore the universes and immediately kill Annihilus and his fleet, ending his threat once and for all.

However, before he could proceed he is confronted by his past selves who didn&#39;t want Adam to sacrifice himself. Being unwilling to let Thanos kill himself and take all existences with him, Adam battles his past selves, eventually using the Soul Stone of one of the Adams to kill them. After that he enters Thanos&#39; psyche where he saw different memories through portals, and eventually came across [[Hunger]] and manipulates the being into attacking the past future omnipotent Thanos. Still travelling through different portals, he finally came across the present Thanos who had been trapped within his future omnipotent self and Eros with Pip who try to free Thanos, but were discovered. After that Adam tells Thanos that the only way to defeat his future omnipotent self and get free was trust. Then as the future omnipotent Thanos was about to end everything, Adam had Kang prevent Eros to proceed with his plan allowing Eros to evade capture. This causes present Thanos to take control of his powers and reset everything prior to the machinations of his future self who ceases to exist. Finding himself outside everything Adam was rescued by Kang and informed the Conqueror on what had transpired. Before returning to normality, Adam asked Kang to go on one final time travel to retrieve the green soul stone.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thanos: The Infinity Ending&#39;&#39; Vol 1 1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Infinity Countdown===\nDuring the \&quot;[[Infinity Countdown]]\&quot; storyline, Adam Warlock realizes that he&#39;s at an unspecified time with Kang the Conqueror, who, with some convincing, shows a recap of Warlock\u2019s history until finally revealing that the Infinity Stones are once more being gathered and shows a vision of the future \u2013 which Kang calls \&quot;Infinity&#39;s End\&quot; - in which an unseen calamity has befallen the universe after the Infinity Stones were reunited.
