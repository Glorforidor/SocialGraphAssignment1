Developed by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, and Mitch Brian, and produced by Warner Bros. Animation, it originally aired on Fox Kids from September 5, 1992, to September 15, 1995, with a total of 85 episodes. For the final fifteen episodes, the series was given the on-screen title The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin, which was also used for reruns of earlier episodes. The series became the first in the continuity of the shared DC animated universe, spawning further animated TV series, feature films, comic books and video games with most of the same creative talent.The series was praised for its thematic complexity, film noir aesthetics, darker tone, artistic presentation, and modernization of its title character&#39;s crime-fighting origins. IGN.com listed Batman: The Animated Series as the best adaptation of Batman anywhere outside of comics, the best comic book television show of all time and the second-best animated series of all time (after The Simpsons). Wizard magazine also ranked it #2 of the greatest animated television shows of all time (again after The Simpsons). TV Guide ranked it the seventh-greatest cartoon of all time. The widespread acclaim led the series to win four Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Animated Program.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe series took influence from Tim Burton&#39;s live-action films, Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), and the acclaimed Superman theatrical cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios in the early 1940s. In designing the series, Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski emulated the Burton films&#39; \&quot;otherworldly timelessness\&quot;, incorporating period features such as black-and-white title cards, police airships (although no such thing existed, Timm has stated that he found it to fit the show&#39;s style) and a \&quot;vintage\&quot; color scheme with film noir flourishes.The visual style of the series was based on the artwork of Radomski, and the gothic look of Gotham City was derived from his initial designs. In addition, Radomski issued a standing order to the animation department that all backgrounds be painted using light colors on black paper (as opposed to the industry standard of dark colors on white paper). The distinctive visual combination of \&quot;noir\&quot; imagery and Art Deco design was dubbed \&quot;Dark Deco\&quot; by the producers.The series initially took a variation of music written by Danny Elfman for the Burton films as its theme; later episodes of the series used a new theme with a similar style by Shirley Walker (Walker was occasionally Elfman&#39;s conductor for films). The score of the series was influenced by Elfman&#39;s work on the Burton films, as well as music of 1940s film noir.\nThe series is more adult-oriented than many of the previous superhero cartoons. It depicts outright physical violence against antagonists, including realistic firearms (though only one character, Commissioner Gordon, was even depicted as having been shot, in the episode \&quot;I Am the Night\&quot;). First-time producers Timm and Radomski reportedly encountered resistance from studio executives, but the success of Burton&#39;s first film allowed the embryonic series to survive long enough to produce a pilot episode, \&quot;On Leather Wings\&quot;, which, according to Timm, \&quot;got a lot of people off our backs\&quot;. During the series&#39; production, producer Alan Burnett wrote a silent episode (without dialogue) entitled \&quot;Silent Night\&quot; to explore more of Batman&#39;s sexual life, but this was never produced. Burnett also intended to make an episode featuring a female vampire that would bite Batman to suck his blood, but plans never materialized.The series is also notable for its supporting cast\u2014numerous known actors provided voices for a variety of recognizable villains, most notably Mark Hamill (previously famous for his role as Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars trilogy) finding success in voice acting thanks to his \&quot;cheerfully deranged\&quot; portrayal of the Joker. The role was originally given to Tim Curry, but he developed bronchitis during the initial recording sessions. John Glover, who later voiced the Riddler, also auditioned for the Joker role. Hamill, who found himself to be the biggest fan of the Batman comics among the cast, credited the laughs he had honed on stage in Amadeus with landing him the role. The recording sessions, under the supervision of voice director Andrea Romano, were recorded with the actors together in one studio instead of taking separate recordings, as is typical. This method would later be employed for all subsequent series in the DC animated universe. Al Pacino was considered to voice Two-Face in the series, but he declined the offer. Richard Moll was instead cast in the role. Other actors included Ron Perlman as Clayface, Roddy McDowall as the Mad Hatter, David Warner as Ra&#39;s al Ghul, Michael York as Count Vertigo, Kate Mulgrew as Red Claw, George Murdock as Boss Biggis and George Dzundza as the Ventriloquist.\nOne of the series&#39; best-known inventions is the Joker&#39;s assistant, Harley Quinn, who became so popular that DC Comics later added her to mainstream Batman comic book continuity. The Penguin underwent change for the series; his appearance was remodeled after the version seen in Batman Returns, which was in production simultaneously with the series&#39; first season. New life was also given to lesser-known characters for the series such as the Clock King. In addition, dramatic changes were made to other villains such as Clayface and Mr. Freeze, who was changed from a gimmicky mad scientist to a tragic figure whose \&quot;frigid exterior [hid] a doomed love and vindictive fury\&quot;.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nThe Joker&#39;s accomplice Harley Quinn, Gotham City police detective Renee Montoya, the vigilante Lock-Up, former actor Simon Trent, and ninja Kyodai Ken are original creations who became characters in the comics. Older villains that were lesser known from the comics, such as Count Vertigo, the Mirror Man and the Clock King, were modified for the series in both appearance and personality. Other original antagonists were created, such as Roland Daggett, Red Claw, Lloyd Ventrix, the Sewer King, Boss Biggis and Emile Dorian, but to little acclaim, and did not make any appearances outside the series, though Daggett was re-imagined as businessman John Daggett for The Dark Knight Rises.\nAside from creating characters that crossed over into the main line of DC Comics, several of the series&#39; reinterpretations were carried over as well. Mr. Freeze was revised in the comics to emulate the series&#39; tragic story, the success of which actually compelled DC to bring the character back after \&quot;killing\&quot; him off some years earlier. Clayface was revised to be much more similar in appearance to his animated counterpart; and Two-Face&#39;s double-sided, black-and-white suit has become a common appearance for the character.\n\n\n=== Bruce Wayne / Batman ===\n\nAt the age of eight, Bruce Wayne, the son of billionaire philanthropists, witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha, during a mugging on the street. The event left him traumatized and mentally scarred for the rest of his life. This left Bruce to be cared for by his family&#39;s butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Over the years, Bruce slowly turned the pain and trauma he sustained into a burning fuel for a lifelong obsession, as he underwent rigorous training in mental and physical conditioning, the martial arts, criminology, sciences, manhunting, forensics, detective work, interrogation methods and intimidation, for the next years of his life. Having observed the rampant crime and corruption across Gotham City, he chose to deal with the crime-wave in Gotham in his own way, by utilizing his years of training and swore an oath to dedicate his entire life to fighting crime, in a bid to avenge the murder of his parents and to use his pain and suffering to drive him to do good, while being guided by his self-enforced moral code to never kill and to refrain from utilizing firearms. Inspired by the presence of bats, his childhood fear, which used to present around his home, Bruce chose to undertake the alias of The Batman, a feared, near-mythical and bat-masked vigilante.\nOne of the most notable changes made in The Animated Series is the treatment of Batman&#39;s alter ego, Bruce Wayne. In nearly all other media, including the comics, television shows and films, Bruce deliberately plays up his image as a vacuous, self-absorbed and not-too-bright billionaire playboy. In The Animated Series, his character is assertive, outwardly intelligent, and actively involved in the management of Wayne Enterprises, without jeopardizing his secret identity. For example: in the episode \&quot;Eternal Youth\&quot;, Bruce is shown angrily ordering one of his directors to cancel a deal with a timber company in the Amazon rainforest that had been made behind his back, threatening him with termination upon failure to comply.\nKevin Conroy used different voices to distinguish between his portrayal of Bruce Wayne and Batman, a tactic used previously by Michael Keaton in Tim Burton&#39;s live-action films. Conroy based his dual-voice performance on the 1934 film adaptation of The Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\n\n=== Dick Grayson ===\nThe story of Dick Grayson began at a circus. Growing up, Dick was a circus performer. He traveled the country with his mother, Mary, and father, John, performing acts as \&quot;the Flying Graysons,\&quot; a world-famous trapeze troupe that performed with Haly&#39;s Circus. Eventually, things turned for the worst. The circus was set to perform in Gotham and was setting up when a mobster named Tony Zucco went up to Mr. Haly and attempted to extort him in exchange for protection money. When Haly refused to pay, Zucco retaliated by having his thugs sabotage the circus&#39;s trapeze with acid. At this time John and Mary were set to begin their act. In the middle of their performance, the tampered wires snapped and sent them plummeting to their deaths right before Dick&#39;s eyes. Bruce Wayne happened to be in attendance to witness the incident and quickly sprung into action as Batman during the chaos. Having had the experience and trauma of being suddenly, violently orphaned, Bruce decided to take Dick under his wing so they could set about avenging the Graysons&#39; murders. After a series of intense training, Dick began making a costume and a Superhero identity for himself. Getting inspiration from his mother&#39;s favorite bird and his favorite folktale hero, Robin Hood, Dick chose the name \&quot;Robin\&quot;, and he officially became Batman&#39;s sidekick, thus creating the Dynamic Duo.\nThe series also redefined the original Robin, Dick Grayson. While much of Dick&#39;s past remains the same, his Robin costume is modernized with short sleeves and long tights, exactly like Tim Drake&#39;s original Robin outfit but with a non-italicized \&quot;R\&quot; symbol. In addition, Dick is given a more serious and mature personality to match the tone of the series. The episode \&quot;Batgirl Returns\&quot; establishes that Dick and Barbara Gordon attend the same college and that they have a mutual romantic attraction to each other, but neither one knows the secret identity of the other. Their relationship is one of the plot elements of the film Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero.\n\n\n=== Barbara Gordon ===\nBarbara Gordon is first seen in the two-parter \&quot;Heart of Steel\&quot;, where she becomes convinced her father is an imposter.  She makes her first appearance as alter ego Batgirl in \&quot;Shadow of the Bat\&quot;, after her father Commissioner Gordon is arrested under charges of corruption. Her Batgirl costume is exactly the same from The Adventures of Batman and the Bronze Age of comics, sporting the same gray bodysuit, blue cape and cowl and yellow bat-symbol and utility belt, but with blue gloves and boots to mirror that of Batman&#39;s costume instead of yellow ones. She makes several appearances throughout the series, and attends the same university as Dick Grayson, though neither of them are aware of each other&#39;s crime fighting alter ego. In \&quot;Batgirl Returns\&quot;, Barbara actually makes a cease fire deal with Catwoman, and they work together in solving the case of missing valuable cat statues while Batman is away.  All of Barbara&#39;s/Batgirl&#39;s appearances are in episodes written by Brynne Stephens.\n\n\n=== The Joker ===\nThough the Joker&#39;s origin is never shown in the series, some of his past is seen in the feature film Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. In flashbacks, he is shown before his accident but is not referred to by name. His potential real name, Jack Napier (the same name of Jack Nicholson\u2019s version of the character), is established in the episodes \&quot;Dreams in Darkness\&quot; when it is spoken by Dr. Bartholomew and in \&quot;Joker&#39;s Wild\&quot; where it is written in a dossier. However, it is stated on a later occasion that the Joker used many aliases throughout his career, meaning his true identity is still unknown.\nThe man who would become the Joker started out as a chauffeur and hitman for mobsters Salvatore Valestra, Buzz Bronski and Chuckie Sol. Twice on separate occasions, he saw Bruce Wayne and exchanged glances years before they would clash as the Joker and Batman. Years later, after the Valestra Mob had gone their separate ways, the pre-Joker struck out on his own and formed a small gang. The night he and his gang broke into the ACE Chemical Plant marked the first time he encountered Batman. During their fight, the pre-Joker fell off a catwalk and into a drainage vat of chemicals. He was washed out into the bay and discovered the chemicals bleached his skin chalk white, dyed his hair green, stained his lips red, leaving them in a permanent rictus smile, and dyed his suit purple. This new, clown-like appearance snapped his already sadistic mind and drove him to eternal insanity. He reinvented himself as the Joker, Batman&#39;s greatest enemy and Gotham City&#39;s most dangerous costumed criminal.\nThe use of this origin was due to the show being heavily patterned after the success and influential tone of Batman. However, when The New Batman Adventures began, during the era of Joel Schumacher&#39;s films, Joker&#39;s origin was retained but his identity was retconned as being merely one of many aliases as seen in the series finale \&quot;Beware the Creeper\&quot;. This reflected the efforts of the writers to put the character back in line with his conflicting multiple origins from the comics.\n\n\n=== Other characters ===\n\nOther antagonists that appeared in the series included classic villain such as Poison Ivy, Catwoman, the Riddler, Two-Face, the Mad Hatter, Ra&#39;s al Ghul, Talia al Ghul, Man-Bat, the Penguin, the Scarecrow, Killer Croc, Bane, the Ventriloquist and his dummy Scarface, Hugo Strange and Tony Zucco. Friends and allies of Batman featured in the show not previously mentioned include Alfred Pennyworth, Harvey Bullock, the Gray Ghost (an original character created by the series to portray Bruce Wayne&#39;s childhood hero and crime-fighting inspiration), Lucius Fox, and Leslie Thompkins.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nList of DC animated universe characters\n\n\n=== Protagonists ===\n\n\n=== Supporting protagonists ===\n\n\n=== Antagonists ===\n\n\n=== Supporting antagonists ===\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n=== Animation ===\nIn order to complete the first season&#39;s 65 episodes, Warner Bros. Animation outsourced the series to several different overseas animation houses: Spectrum Animation, Sunrise, Studio Junio and Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as TMS Entertainment) in Japan, Dong Yang Animation, Koko Enterprises Ltd. and AKOM in South Korea, Jade Animation in Hong Kong, Blue Pencil in Spain and Network of Animation (NOA) in Canada. TMS also animated the first season&#39;s opening theme sequence. AKOM was eventually fired due to its inconsistent animation in many episodes such as \&quot;Cat Scratch Fever\&quot; and \&quot;Moon of the Wolf\&quot;.The 20 episodes of the second season were animated largely by Dong Yang, with the exception of three done by Studio Junio (\&quot;A Bullet for Bullock\&quot;, \&quot;Avatar\&quot; and \&quot;Baby-Doll\&quot;) and one done by Jade Animation (\&quot;The Terrible Trio\&quot;).On the commentary track for \&quot;Heart of Ice\&quot; on the Batman: The Animated Series, Volume One DVD, producer Bruce Timm stated that Spectrum was responsible for airbrushing Mr. Freeze&#39;s helmet in every frame that featured him. Such attention to detail ultimately drove the studio to bankruptcy; most of their staff members are now working for Production I.G.\n\n\n=== Adaptations ===\nThe show also featured numerous adaptations of various Batman comics stories. The following episodes were adaptations:\n\nThe episode \&quot;Appointment in Crime Alley\&quot; is based on \&quot;There Is No Hope in Crime Alley\&quot; from Detective Comics #457 (March 1976) by writer Denny O&#39;Neil and artist Dick Giordano.\n\&quot;Dreams in Darkness\&quot; is loosely based on \&quot;Batman: The Last Arkham\&quot; from Batman: Shadow of the Bat #1\u20134 by writer Alan Grant and artist Norm Breyfogle (June\u2013September, 1992). This episode adapted the comic book story with the inclusion of Scarecrow instead of Victor Zsasz and Dr. Bartholomew instead of Jeremiah Arkham.\n\&quot;The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy\&quot; was an adaptation of \&quot;The Cape and Cowl Death Trap!\&quot; from Detective Comics #450 (August 1975), written by Elliot S. Maggin and drawn by artist Walt Simonson.\nPart 1 of \&quot;Robin&#39;s Reckoning\&quot; takes its cues from \&quot;Batman and \&quot;Robin the Boy Wonder\&quot;\&quot; in Detective Comics #38 (April 1940) by writer Bill Finger, artist Bob Kane and illustrator Jerry Robinson.\nThe episode \&quot;The Laughing Fish\&quot; was based on three Batman comics, blended together; \&quot;The Joker&#39;s Five-Way Revenge\&quot; from Batman #251 (September 1973) by Denny O&#39;Neil with art by Neal Adams, followed by \&quot;The Laughing Fish\&quot; and \&quot;Sign of the Joker!\&quot; from Detective Comics #475 and #476, of (February\u2013March 1978), both by writer Steve Englehart with art by Marshall Rogers. During a spotlight podcast from Comic-Con 2007, Paul Dini explained that the reason why the episode combined those stories was that the show&#39;s creators could not adapt them separately, because their content and thematic elements would not have been cleared by the censors.\n\&quot;The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne\&quot; was based on the comic stories \&quot;The Dead Yet Live\&quot; and \&quot;I Am the Batman!\&quot; from Detective Comics #471 and #472 (August\u2013September 1977) by Steve Englehart.\n\&quot;Moon of the Wolf\&quot; is based on the comic story of the same name by writer Len Wein with art by Neal Adams, from Batman #255 (April 1974).\nThe episode \&quot;Terror in the Sky\&quot; is loosely based on \&quot;Man-Bat Over Vegas\&quot;, originally presented in Detective Comics #429, by writer and artist Frank Robbins. The setting has been shifted from Las Vegas to Gotham Harbor, and in keeping with the family-friendly rating of the television show, She-Bat is not a vampire in the adaptation. The final line of the episode, \&quot;the nightmare&#39;s finally over\&quot;, is similar to one of the final lines from the original comic, \&quot;Now Fran&#39;s vampire nightmare is about over\&quot;.\nThe episode \&quot;Almost Got &#39;Im\&quot; appears to be influenced by a four-issue story arc in Batman #291\u2013294 (1977), entitled \&quot;Where Were You on the Night Batman Was Killed?\&quot;.  All four stories were written by David Vern Reed and drawn by John Calnan under the direction of Batman editor Julius Schwartz. In each of the four issues, one of Catwoman, The Riddler, and The Joker all recount their claims to have killed Batman. However, the plot for \&quot;Almost Got &#39;Im\&quot; is quite different (six stories in the show, and four completely different ones in the comic book), with only the Joker as an overlapping antagonist.\nTwo-Face&#39;s strategy in \&quot;Almost Got &#39;Im\&quot; (strapping down Batman to a giant coin and flipping the coin in the air) was taken from the comic; World&#39;s Finest Comics #30 (September 1947) by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane. In a backup tale, both Batman and Robin were tied to a giant penny that was catapulted onto spikes by a lesser-known villain the Penny Plunderer.\n\&quot;Off Balance\&quot; is a direct adaptation of \&quot;Batman: Into the Den of the Death-Dealers\&quot; from Detective Comics #411, (May 1971) written by writer Dennis O&#39;Neil and drawn by artists Bob Brown and Dick Giordano. Famous for the first appearance of the mysterious Talia character.\nThe two-part episode \&quot;The Demon&#39;s Quest\&quot; is a direct adaptation of \&quot;Daughter of the Demon\&quot; from Batman #232, (June 1971), and \&quot;The Demon Lives Again\&quot; Batman #244 (September 1972), written by Dennis O&#39;Neil and drawn by artist Neal Adams. Famous for introducing one of Batman&#39;s deadlier foes; Ra&#39;s al Ghul, father of Talia.\nThe episode \&quot;Sideshow\&quot; is loosely based on \&quot;A Vow From the Grave\&quot; from Detective Comics #410 by writer Dennis O&#39;Neil and artists Bob Brown and Dick Giordano. This episode adapted the comic book story with the inclusion of a separate Killer Croc story.\n\&quot;A Bullet for Bullock\&quot; is based on the comic of the same name from Detective Comics #651 (October 1992), by writer Chuck Dixon and artist Graham Nolan.\nThe feature film Mask of the Phantasm is also an adaptation. The film&#39;s flashbacks were inspired by \&quot;Batman: Year One\&quot;, whereas the character of Andrea Beaumont and the storyline itself were modified from Mike Barr&#39;s story \&quot;Batman: Year Two\&quot;, which ran in Detective Comics #575\u2013578 in the late 1980s; the villain in the comics was named The Reaper.\n\n\n=== In other media ===\nSixteen minutes of animated segments in the video game The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin for the Sega CD are sometimes referred to as a \&quot;lost episode\&quot; of the series. These segments are intended to be interspersed between gameplay elements of an early-1990s video game and as such, the sound, color and story are not quite of the same quality of the actual television program. And because Sega did not have to follow the censorship rules of the show, the fights are also a little more violent. Many of the shows voice actors reprised their roles for the game, and are thus in the lost episode as well. Similar cutscenes appear throughout the video games Batman: Vengeance and Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu.\n\n\n== Feature films ==\nBatman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993) \u2013 based on The Animated Series; the film started production as a direct-to-video release, but was ultimately changed into a theatrical release. Although the film was not a financial success upon its initial release, it earned widespread acclaim and has since become a commercial success through its various home video releases.\nBatman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero (1998) \u2013 a direct-to-video release, which was produced as a tie-in to the 1997 film Batman &amp; Robin. SubZero&#39;s release was delayed until the following year due to Batman &amp; Robin failing to meet commercial and critical expectations.\n\n\n== Comic adaptation and novelization ==\n\nThe Animated Series was accompanied by a tie-in comic book, The Batman Adventures, which followed the art style and continuity of The Animated Series instead of other Batman comic books. The Batman Adventures, through several format changes to reflect the changing world of the series and its spin-offs, outlasted the series itself by nearly a decade, finally being cancelled in 2004 to make way for the tie-in comic of the then-new, unrelated Batman animated series; The Batman. The character of Harley Quinn&#39;s first official comic appearance occurred in issue twelve of the series. It has become highly sought after by collectors and fans of the character.\nThere was also a short-lived series of tie-in novels, adapted from episodes of the series by science fiction author Geary Gravel. To achieve novel-length, Gravel combined several related episodes into a single storyline in each novel. The novels included:\n\nShadows of the Past (\&quot;Appointment in Crime Alley\&quot;, \&quot;Robin&#39;s Reckoning\&quot; two-parter)\nDual to the Death (\&quot;Two-Face\&quot; two-parter, \&quot;Shadow of the Bat\&quot; two-parter)\nThe Dragon and the Bat (\&quot;Night of the Ninja\&quot;, \&quot;Day of the Samurai\&quot;)\nMask of the Phantasm (Batman: Mask of the Phantasm movie)DC announced in February 2020 that Paul Dini, Alan Burnett and artist Ty Templeton would be leading a new mini-series, Batman: The Adventures Continue, to be first published in April 2020, based on the animated series and following shortly after its conclusion, with Tim Drake still adjusting as the new Robin to Batman.\n\n\n== Broadcasting ==\n\nBatman: The Animated Series premiered on the Fox Broadcasting Company&#39;s children&#39;s block Fox Kids on September 5, 1992, and aired in that block during weekday afternoons at 4:30 PM. In December, just three months after its debut, Fox also began airing episodes of the series on prime-time Sunday evenings (followed by the live-action sitcom Shaky Ground); however, the TV ratings fell short (as the show aired opposite the perennial favorite 60 Minutes), and the series was removed from this time slot in March 1993.\nAfter the series produced its 65th episode (the minimum number necessary for a TV series to be successfully syndicated), Fox Network executives ordered a second season of 20 more episodes that was later reduced to airing weekly on Saturday mornings. The second season featured Robin more prominently and, as a result, was retitled The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin in the title credits; this run of episodes had two new opening sequences and ending credits. In total, the series reached 85 episodes before finishing its original run on September 15, 1995.\nIn 1997, following the end of Fox Kids&#39; five-year exclusive broadcast contract, the series began airing in reruns on The WB Network&#39;s children&#39;s block Kids&#39; WB. Later that year, The New Batman Adventures premiered on Kids&#39; WB, airing alongside Superman: The Animated Series as part of an hour-long program titled The New Batman/Superman Adventures.\nCartoon Network aired reruns of Batman: The Animated Series from March 2, 1998 to 2004. On July 3, 2000, the series was added to Cartoon Network&#39;s Toonami line-up. In 2005, reruns of the series were aired on Cartoon Network&#39;s sister channel Boomerang.\nThe series later began airing on Toon Disney&#39;s Jetix line-up on September 30, 2007, again alongside Superman: The Animated Series  (despite Warner Bros. being one of Disney&#39;s biggest competitors).\nThe show aired on Teletoon Retro (a Canadian broadcasting channel), debuting on January 8, 2010. The first 65 episodes were confirmed, with the first being \&quot;The Cat and Claw, Part 1\&quot;. The show was scheduled to air on a weekly basis, airing at 7:00 AM, 6:00 PM, and midnight. All times are Eastern.The Hub started broadcasting the series on September 6, 2011. The channel aired a 10-episode marathon of the series on July 20, 2012, to coincide with the theatrical release of The Dark Knight Rises and even created an animated version of one of the film&#39;s trailers, featuring Kevin Conroy and Adrienne Barbeau re-dubbing Batman and Catwoman&#39;s dialogue from the trailer.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nBatman: The Animated Series has been consistently ranked as one of the greatest animated television shows ever made. It has been critically acclaimed for its sophistication, mature tone, complex story, voice acting, orchestrated soundtrack, artistic ambition, and faithfulness to the source material. In 1992, Entertainment Weekly ranked the series as one of the top television series of the year.In his reference book, Batman: The Complete History, Les Daniels described The Animated Series as coming \&quot;as close as any artistic statement has to defining the look of Batman for the 1990s.\&quot; Animation historian Charles Solomon gave the series a somewhat mixed assessment, commenting that \&quot;the dark, Art Deco-influenced backgrounds tended to eclipse the stiff animation and pedestrian storytelling\&quot; and concluding that the series \&quot;looked better in stills than it did on the screen.\&quot;IGN listed The Animated Series as the best adaptation of Batman anywhere outside of comics, the best comic book cartoon of all time, and the second-best animated series of all time (after The Simpsons). Wizard magazine also ranked it #2 of the greatest animated television shows of all time (again after The Simpsons). TV Guide ranked Batman: The Animated Series the seventh-greatest cartoon of all time (out of 60).\n\n\n=== Influence ===\nDue to the success of Batman: The Animated Series, many crew members went on to design and produce Superman: The Animated Series for The WB Network. During this time they created The New Batman Adventures, which featured the same streamlined animation style as Superman: The Animated Series, as well as numerous character re-designs from the original series despite taking place in the same continuity.\nIn 1999, a futuristic spin-off series titled Batman Beyond premiered on The WB, featuring a teenager named Terry McGinnis taking on the duties of Batman under the guidance of an elderly Bruce Wayne. Then in 2001, the Justice League animated series premiered on Cartoon Network, featuring Batman as one of the founding members of the League. This was continued in 2004 by Justice League Unlimited, featuring a greatly expanded League. Many DC cartoons unrelated to the larger DC animated universe, such as Teen Titans and The Batman, also featured character designs strongly influenced by those of Bruce Timm.\nThe dramatic writing and stylized art of Batman: The Animated Series separates it from many traditional comic book-based cartoons. It can be considered the dramatic equivalent of more adult-oriented cartoon shows like The Simpsons. For this reason the show&#39;s popularity (along with that of its various spin-offs) endures among older audiences and comic book fans.\nThe Lego minifigures of various Batman characters are more strongly based on the designs from Batman: The Animated Series than any other form of Batman media. More precisely, the Joker, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze and Harley Quinn&#39;s minifigures seem to have identical costumes and faces to the characters from the series.\nThe dark atmosphere, mature themes, and even some of the voice cast from the series are employed in the Batman: Arkham video game series. Furthermore, Kevin Conroy reprises his role as Batman and the first two games are co-written by series veteran Paul Dini. Also, Batman&#39;s design and costume in The Animated Series are featured as an alternate skin in Batman: Arkham City. These skins are available as downloadable content; they were also available in pre-orders at GameStop and a valid membership to Power-Up Rewards. There are also Animated-inspired alternate skins for Catwoman, Nightwing and Robin.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nAnnie Awards\n\n1992 \u2013 Best Animated Television Program (nominated)\n1994 \u2013 Best Achievement for Voice Acting - Mark Hamill (nominated)\n1994 \u2013 Best Animated Television Program (nominated)\n1994 \u2013 Best Individual Achievement for Creative Supervision in the Field of Animation - Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski (nominated)\n1994 \u2013 Best Individual Achievement for Story Contribution in the Field of Animation - Paul Dini (nominated)\n1995 \u2013 Best Animated Television Program (nominated)\n1995 \u2013 Best Individual Achievement for Music in the Field of Animation - Shirley Walker (nominated)Primetime Emmy Awards\n\n1993 \u2013 Outstanding Animated Program \u2013 Jean MacCurdy, Tom Ruegger, Alan Burnett, Eric Radomski, Bruce Timm, Randy Rogel and Dick Sebast for \&quot;Robin&#39;s Reckoning: Part 1\&quot; (WON)Daytime Emmy Awards\n\n1993 \u2013 Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program - Michael Reaves, Sean Catherine Derek, Martin Pasko and Paul Dini (WON)\n1993 \u2013 Outstanding Animated Program - Tom Ruegger, Eric Radomski, Frank Paur, Kevin Altieri, Alan Burnett, Jean MacCurdy, Bruce Timm and Boyd Kirkland (nominated)\n1993 \u2013 Outstanding Film Sound Editing - Russell Brower, Matt Thorne, Robert Hargreaves, Mark Keatts, Bob Lacivita, Jeff M.

The main theme of the show, which was heard during the opening and ending credits of each episode, was composed by Danny Elfman. At first, Elfman turned down Bruce Timm&#39;s offer to compose the theme for the show and so Timm hired Shirley Walker to do so. However, Elfman later changed his mind and composed a variation of his 1989 Batman movie theme for the series. Walker&#39;s unused theme went on to become the main theme for the second season of the show, when the name was changed to The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin.In 1996, Walker won her first Daytime Emmy Award for her music direction of the episode \&quot;A Bullet for Bullock\&quot; (scored by Harvey R. Cohen). She would then go on to win another Daytime Emmy Award in the category of music-composition for Batman Beyond in 2001.Although at least twenty-four different composers worked on the series, Walker, Lolita Ritmanis, and Michael McCuistion are regarded as the main contributors. After the series finished up in 1995, the three then went on to score Superman: The Animated Series (which also featured a theme by Walker) in 1996, The New Batman Adventures in 1997 and Batman Beyond in 1999. Television composer Kristopher Carter scored alongside Walker, Ritmanis, and McCuistion throughout the many DCAU series and later filled in for Walker after her death in 2006.\n\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\nOn December 16, 2008, La La Land Records announced the release of a soundtrack companion to Batman: The Animated Series on a two-disc CD set, which featured 11 episode scores (including those of \&quot;On Leather Wings\&quot;, the \&quot;Two-Face\&quot; two-parter, \&quot;Joker&#39;s Favor\&quot; and \&quot;Perchance to Dream\&quot;). The release was limited to a pressing of 3,000 copies, which sold quickly. About one month after its release, the soundtrack set had sold over 2,500 copies. According to a spokesperson of La-La Land Records, the sold out status of the soundtrack \&quot;can only help as the label hopes to convince Warner Bros. to release more Batman: The Animated Series soundtracks.\&quot; The soundtrack received largely positive reviews.On March 24, 2009, La La Land Records released the complete score for the animated film Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. It was a limited edition of 3,000 units and has since sold out.The 2008 soundtrack was re-released in July 2012, minus \&quot;Gotham City Overture\&quot; (a suite featuring Walker&#39;s themes from the series, some of which do not appear elsewhere on the album) and \&quot;Music of the Bat 101\&quot; (a bonus track with Walker herself demonstrating the show&#39;s main music). The re-release is a limited edition of 5,000 units by La La Land Records.On July 19, 2012, La La Land Records also released a four-disc CD set with a further 21 episode scores (including those of \&quot;Heart of Ice\&quot;, the \&quot;Feat of Clay\&quot; two-parter, \&quot;Almost Got &#39;Im\&quot; and \&quot;The Laughing Fish\&quot;), titled Batman: The Animated Series \u2013 Original Soundtrack from the Warner Bros. Television Series, Volume Two. Volume 2 is a limited-edition release of 3,500 units by La La Land Records.On October 7, 2014, La La Land Records released a four-disc set with another 24 episode scores (including those of the \&quot;Robin&#39;s Reckoning\&quot; two-parter, \&quot;Mudslide\&quot;, \&quot;I Am the Night\&quot; and \&quot;The Man Who Killed Batman\&quot;), titled Batman: The Animated Series \u2013 Original Soundtrack from the Warner Bros. Television Series, Volume Three. Volume 3 is a limited-edition release of 3,000 units by La La Land Records.On March 29, 2016, La La Land Records released the complete soundtrack for the animated film Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman. It is a limited edition of 2,000 units.On July 26, 2016, La La Land Records released Batman: The Animated Series \u2013 Original Soundtrack from the Warner Bros. Television Series, Volume Four, which contains the remaining material from the first 65 episodes. The final 9 episode scores from the first season are featured (including those of \&quot;Fear of Victory\&quot;, \&quot;His Silicon Soul\&quot; and \&quot;Joker&#39;s Wild\&quot;), as well as never-before-released cues from scores featured on earlier volumes. Volume 4 is a limited-edition release of 3,000 units by La La Land Records.La La Land Records is also planning to cover the later incarnations of the series (The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin and The New Batman Adventures) in the future, provided that sales of existing volumes are strong enough and that there is strong fan encouragement. A Superman: The Animated Series soundtrack has also been released as of January 2014, and a Justice League volume was released on July 26, 2016. Justice League Unlimited and a second volume of Superman: The Animated Series will only be released if Justice League and the first Superman: The Animated Series volume sell well.On July 22, 2014, WaterTower Music released six digital albums on download and streaming platforms (covering La La Land&#39;s first and second volumes, including \&quot;Gotham City Overture\&quot; and \&quot;Music of the Bat 101\&quot;) for the series in honor of the 75th anniversary of Batman.Asterisked tracks contain thematic material by Shirley Walker; double-asterisked tracks contain Danny Elfman&#39;s Batman theme.\n\n\n==== Volume 1 track listing ====\n\n\n==== Volume 2 track listing ====\n\n\n==== Volume 3 track listing ====\n\n\n== Home media ==\n\n\n=== VHS ===\n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n\n\n==== United States ====\n\n\n==== Chinese subtitled ====\n\n\n==== Spanish dubbed ====\n\n\n=== DVD ===\nRegion 1\nWarner Home Video (via DC Comics Entertainment and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment) has released Batman: The Animated Series on DVD in Region 1 in three volume box sets. A fourth volume containing all 24 episodes of The New Batman Adventures was also released and these episodes now also begin with the original Season 1 opening sequence, and also end with the standard final credits. Warner Home Video later released Batman: The Complete Animated Series, which features all episodes from both the original series and The New Batman Adventures, on DVD in Region 1. The set includes all features from the four individual volumes plus a bonus 17th disc with a new special feature and a 40-page collector&#39;s book containing artwork. The DVD was originally on sale for a limited time only and went out of print in January 2009. Warner Home Video released a second printing of the DVD in May 2009, but then withdrew it three months later.\n\nRegion 2\nVolumes 1 and 2 were released on DVD in the UK on October 10, 2005 (Volume 1), and August 21, 2006 (Volume 2). These DVD volumes were exclusive to the retail chain HMV in the United Kingdom, a complete series 25th-anniversary collection was released in the UK on October 30, 2017 containing all 4 Volumes. Volumes 3 &amp; 4 were previously unreleased in the UK before the 25th-anniversary box set release.On June 14, 2008, Volume 1 was re-released in the UK as a non-HMV exclusive, though both the artwork and the extras remain the same as the original HMV exclusive release. Volume 2 was released in the same way on March 3, 2009.In Bulgaria, Volumes 1 and 2 were released in early 2006. Each disc was sold separately in an amaray case.\nRegion 3\nIn Hong Kong, the show was packaged into four different DVD volume sets just as it was done in Region 1. Volumes 1 and 2 were both released on February 28, 2005, while Volume 3 was released July 7, 2005, and Volume 4 was released February 17, 2006.Region 4\nIn Australia, Volume 1 was released on October 19, 2005. Volumes and the box set are available at websites like eBay.com, Amazon.com and Quicksales.com. All four volumes are available on the Australian iTunes Store, and were released individually on DVD on November 9, 2016, by Village Roadshow.\n\n\n=== Blu-ray ===\nDuring the series&#39;s 25th anniversary panel at the New York Comic Con on October 8, 2017, it was announced that the complete series and all 24 episodes of The New Batman Adventures was released on Blu-ray later in 2018 (due to the financial success of the Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Blu-ray release in 2017). The Blu-ray release came out in Fall 2018.\nThe numbered, limited-edition box sets also included a code for a free digital SD and HD copy of the complete series, 3 collectible Funko Pocket Pops of Batman, Joker and Harley Quinn, 7 exclusive lenticular cards of original animation artwork, as well as Blu-ray copies of both spin-off animated films Mask of the Phantasm and SubZero.\n\n\n== Video games ==\nSeveral video games based on the animated continuity were released during the 16-bit game-machine era, using The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin second season branding. Konami developed a game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), while Sega released versions of the game for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Mega-CD and Game Gear. The SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive and Game Gear versions were side-scrolling action games, while the Mega-CD version featured a 3-D driving adventure. All of the games had art true to the series, while Sega&#39;s versions featured art elements directly from the show&#39;s creators. The CD version has over 20 minutes of original animated footage comparable to the most well-crafted episodes, with the principal voice actors reprising their roles.\nThere was also a game made for the Game Boy based on the series and created around the same time. Developed and published by Konami, this game was distinctive upon the fact that it still used the earlier Batman: The Animated Series moniker instead of The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin second season title given to the other games.\nThough not directly related, the Batman: Arkham video game series features some of the voice cast from The Animated Series returning to their roles, notably including Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as The Joker. Arleen Sorkin also reprised her role as Harley Quinn in the first game of the series, Batman: Arkham Asylum; additionally, the first two games were written by Animated Series writer Paul Dini. Many of the characters&#39; costumes from the series also appear as downloadable skins in the games.\n\n\n== Proposed spin-off ==\nDue to the success of the show, Fox approached Bruce Timm to make a spin-off centered on Catwoman, but the project was abandoned shortly thereafter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGotham Girls\nList of Batman: The Animated Series episodes aired from September 5, 1992\nList of The New Batman Adventures episodes aired from September 13, 1997\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial DC comics Site\nThe Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin at Fox Kids (Archive)\nBatman: The Animated Series at The World&#39;s Finest\nBatman: The Animated Series at Legions of Gotham\nBatman: The Animated Series at DCAU Wiki\nBatman: The Animated Series on IMDb\nBatman: The Animated Series at Big Cartoon DataBase\nBatman: The Animated Series at TV.com\nThe Animated Batman\n\&quot;Batmanimation\&quot; The home for all things animated Batman\nBatman: The Animated Series in Filmaffinity\nHomage to the Animated Series through the Riddler character, Flash games and animations&quot;</span>
