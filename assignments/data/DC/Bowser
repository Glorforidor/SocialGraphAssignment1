The FBI sends in Special Agent Baldwin P. Vess (Codename: Bulletproof) to help take down Big Boss. However, Vess suffered very serious injuries in a car wreck during a fight with Big Boss\u2019 criminal henchmen and had to be taken to the hospital. Facing years of rehabilitation, Vess is outfitted with a cybernetic bulletproof torso that allows him to walk again.\n\nWhile staying at the hospital, Bulletproof, knowing he cannot do all of this alone, sends out Empire City police officer P.J. O\u2019Malley (Codename: LongArm) and rookie officer Donny Brooks (Codename: HardTop) to round up the best law enforcers from all over the country. With these men and women consisting of David E. \u201cHighway\u201d Harlson, Colt \u201cMace\u201d Howards, Stan \u201cBarricade\u201d Hyde, Tina \u201cMainframe\u201d Cassidy, Walker \u201cSundown\u201d Calhoun, Suzie \u201cMirage\u201d Young, Hugh S. \u201cBullseye\u201d Forward, and Rex \u201cBowser\u201d Pointer and his robot dog Blitz, he forms a team that is \u201cthe finest law enforcement agency there is in the country.\u201d&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Hal |title=Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 Through 2003 |date=2005 |edition=2nd |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co |isbn=978-1476665993 |pages=213\u2013214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulletproof becomes the proud founder and commander of COPS.

Bulletproof would narrate at the beginning of the episode as well as at the end, concluding by repeating the COPS file number and title, ending it with \u201cCase Closed\u201d with a \u201cClosed\u201d mark being stamped onto the file folder. The two exceptions are the first parts of each of the two-part episodes, \u201cThe Case of Big Boss\u2019 Master Plan\u201d and \u201cThe Case of C.O.P.S. File #1,\u201d where the conclusion of the episode is marked with a \u201cCase Continued\u201d plastered on the files.\n\nIn the cartoon, the COPS frequently shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s crime fighting time!\u201d as a [[battle cry]] when it was time to bag the CROOKS and solve a caper. Meanwhile, the CROOKS would shout \u201cCrime\u2019s a-wasting!\u201d whenever they went to do another caper, whether it was pulling another heist (as in so many episodes such as \u201cThe Case of the Blur Bandits\u201d), giving C.O.P.S. a hard time to the point of replacing (actually disposing) them for good (as in \u201cThe Case of the Big Boss\u2019 Master Plan\u201d) or taking captive a certain individual to be held [[hostage|prisoner]] for ransom (as in \u201cThe Case of the Ransomed Rascal\u201d).\n\nThe music for the series was created by [[Shuki Levy]], while the &#39;&#39;COPS&#39;&#39; theme music was written and composed by [[Haim Saban]].\n\nNumerous characters were featured in the cartoon that did not have action figures (including Mainframe, Brian O\u2019Malley, Whitney Morgan, Nightshade, Ms. Demeanor, and Mirage).\n\n==Characters==\n\n===COPS===\n\nCOPS is short for Central Organization of Police Specialists.

During the fight, he ends up seriously injured in a car wreck and is taken to the hospital. To save his life, Mayor Davis had the research scientists from the Overdine Institute perform an operation that gives Baldwin a cybernetic torso to save his life as it would take years for his torso to recover.

Doctor Badvibes has a glass dome on top of his head which shows his abnormally large brain and is known to create literal brainstorms by charging electricity through his brainwaves to form a cloud that can produce rain, thunder, and lightning.\n** Buzzbomb (voiced by [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]]) \u2014 A [[robot]] created by Doctor Badvibes for companionship that works for Big Boss.

He is seen wearing a red suit and fedora and carries around a violin case that hides his favorite playtoy, a deadly modified Thompson submachine gun with a scope attachment that he uses to blast away at any target at will.

He held a criminal contest against Big Boss to determine who will stay in Empire City and who will leave. A challenge like that caused Big Boss to orchestrate Highway&#39;s kidnapping in order to get Bulletproof and Barricade to help him. During the criminal games, COPS managed to turn the tables against Hyena and his goons and arrest them. Hyena and his henchmen later inexplicably popped up as minions of Big Boss indicating that the two of them have formed an alliance.\n** Bullit \u2014 Bullit is a henchman of Hyena.

They include:\n\n* The Bugman \u2014 A short criminal who uses an [[insect]]-controlling device that enables him to control insects to commit his crimes after people stopped showing up to his flea circus. He joined up with Big Boss\u2019 gang, but left when he did not get a high pay. This causes Nightshade and Buttons McBoomBoom to steal Bugman&#39;s bugs and the insect-controlling device and use them in their crimes. When Mainframe and Bowser and Blitz found him after tailing Gaylord, they find out that Bugman only turned to crime because people stopped coming to see his Flea Circus meaning that he was simply desperate. They help him into regaining his insect-controlling device. Though Buttons and Nightshade are defeated, Bugman is also arrested for trying to steal jewels that the pair stole using Bugman&#39;s bugs. He was last seen restarting his flea circus in prison where his entertaining of the guards is a diversion for Gaylord who secretly makes for the keys. In \u201cThe Case of the Lesser of Two Weevils,\u201d Bugman escapes from prison when Gaylord gets captured by his rival the Boll Weevil. When Boll Weevil was defeated, Bugman and Gaylord went back to show business.\n** Gaylord \u2014 A [[weevil]] who is the Bugman&#39;s favorite insect. He leads Bugman&#39;s insects in Bugman&#39;s crime spree.\n* Joseph \u201cJim\u201d Vargas \u2014 The corrupt head of [[City council|City Council]] who was bribed by Big Boss to make the Instant Justice Machines. When the Instant Justice Machines caught Mace and Barricade trespassing in Vetrocon, he called Big Boss about what to do. When COPS storms Vetrocon, Vargas unleashes the Instant Justice Machines on them. When Mace and Barricade catch up to Vargas, he threatens to blow up the factory. He then demands immunity and an offer to name names of anyone involved. Barricade is able to convince Vargas that suicide would be a waste. Vargas then realises he doesn&#39;t want to kill himself and the people in the factory, so he gives himself up and is sentenced to prison.\n** Instant Justice Machines \u2014 A bunch of [[robot]]s built by Vargas in order to put COPS out of business. They act not only as police officers, but also as [[judge]]s and [[Prison officer|jailers]] leaving the culprit trapped until a police car comes by. Some of the crimes they busted involved a man illegally parking on a spot that is only allowed on Tuesdays, a woman jaywalking, a man littering when his hat fell off in the wind while carrying groceries, and two teens speeding on their skateboards. When it came to Highway busting Ms. Demeanor, an Instant Justice Machine found her innocent of all charges. The Instant Justice Machines ended up fighting COPS when they stormed Vetrocon. Barricade even talked the Instant Justice Machine guarding him and Mac into releasing them. When Mace and Barricade end up cornering Vargas, the other Instant Justice Machines stopped their attacks. Following Vargas\u2019 arrest, most of the Instant Justice Machines were deactivated except for the one that Barricade talked into freeing him and Mace. The Instant Justice Machine in COPS\u2019 possession reappeared in \u201cThe Case of the Big Boss\u2019 Master Plan\u201d two-part episode.\n* Johnny Yuma \u2014 Johnny Yuma is the former partner of Sundown who became an [[Outlaw (stock character)|outlaw]]. He was put away by Sundown for trying to steal the money they recovered from a robbery and various train robberies. He eventually escapes from the Texas State Prison to take revenge on Sundown. When Turbo Tu-Tone sees him, he calls up Big Boss who instructs him to follow Johnny and know his every move. Sundown hears of Johnny&#39;s prison break and manages to confront him when he breaks into the cowboy museum to regain his lasso, from the Outlaws Hall of Fame. Johnny manages to lasso Sundown to a robotic bull. As Johnny heads out to rob the Silver Bullet Express, Turbo Tu-Tone trails him and turns on the robotic bull to stall Sundown. Upon being tipped off by Turbo Tu-Tone, Big Boss sends Berserko, Rock Krusher, and Buttons McBoomBoom to recruit Johnny Yuma. When the three rendezvous with Turbo Tu-Tone to recruit Johnny Yuma into Big Boss\u2019 gang, Johnny Yuma tells them that he works alone and defeats them. Johnny then leaves to go rob the Silver Bullet Express prompting Berserko to lead the Turbo Tu-Tone, Rock Krusher, and Buttons McBoomBoom into robbing it first. Sundown manages to catch up to Johnny Yuma on the Silver Bullet Express and ends up fighting him until Big Boss\u2019 minions crash the fight. After Berserko, Turbo Tu-Tone, Rock Krusher, and Buttons McBoomBoom were defeated, Johnny Yuma agrees to return to jail to finish his sentence which led to an early release due to good behavior. He now works as a deputy in a small Texas town.\n* Small Guy \u2014 A pint-sized criminal who ran his own gang.\n* Jenny Wringer \u2014 A female [[Confidence trick|con artist]].\n* Big Momma \u2014 An old lady who is Big Boss&#39;s mother and Berserko&#39;s grandmother. She is blind to the fact that her son is not as skinny as she thought him to have been. When she once visited Empire City to visit her son, Big Boss had to cover up his criminal side by stating that he is a philanthropist and even started an orphanage with his henchmen posing as orphans. Due to his mother being around, he was not able to successfully steal the money and had to donate it to charity. In \u201cThe Case of the Lost Boss,\u201d she secretly moves to Kansas and orchestrates her son&#39;s kidnapping before he can plan a heist on Stargy Island&#39;s diamond mines. Big Momma&#39;s kidnapping of Big Boss caused his henchman to blame the COPS for Big Boss\u2019 disappearance causing them to capture Barricade. Berserko tails the COPS when they run into Big Momma and informs Doctor Badvibes that Big Boss is at Big Momma&#39;s apartment. The C.R.O.O.K.S managed to swipe Big Boss from Big Momma&#39;s apartment so that they can get on with their plans to take over Stargy Island. COPS thwarted Big Boss\u2019 plans causing him to escape with Big Momma.\n* Mukluk \u2014 A tricky Canadian thief.\n* Boll Weevil \u2014 An [[insect]]-themed villain. He once captured Gaylord causing Bugman to escape from prison to get him back.\n* Addictem \u2014 A [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]] who was selling Crystal Twists that were causing people to become addicted to them. He tried to join Big Boss\u2019 gang only to be denied since Big Boss does not deal in drugs. Because of Addictem spreading his Crystal Twist drugs across Empire City and Berserko falling into a Crystal Twist crate trying to steal a cache of Mayan Gold, Big Boss and his gang had to team up with COPS to stop Addictem&#39;s drug ring. When Addictem was chased into the hospital and grabbed by Berserko, Addictem surrendered to COPS to evade getting beaten up by Berserko. Addictem was sentenced to life in prison and those who were affected by the Crystal Twists are recovering from them. Big Boss and his gang went right back to crime after his capture.\n\n===Supporting===\n\n*[[Mayor]] Davis \u2014 The mayor of Empire City.\n*[[Police commissioner|Commissioner]] Highwaters \u2014 The female police commissioner of Empire City.\n* Whitney Morgan (voiced by Jeri Craden) \u2014 ECTV top [[Journalist|reporter]] who is referred to as the prettiest reporter in Empire City.\n** Beamer \u2014 Whitney Morgan&#39;s camera [[robot]].\n* Brian O\u2019Malley \u2014 LongArm&#39;s son.\n\n===Minor===\n\n*[[Judge]] Davis \u2014 Mayor Davis\u2019 [[twin]] brother.\n* Linda O\u2019Malley \u2014 LongArm&#39;s wife.\n* Mickey O\u2019Malley \u2014 LongArm&#39;s dad.\n*[[President of the United States]] \u2014 An unnamed African-American female.\n* Suds Sparko \u2014 A criminal put away by Mickey O\u2019Malley in the 1990s, who later became Rock Krusher&#39;s cell mate.

Later the Prince learned his lesson when he tried to get on a broken down Ferris wheel to ride it only to find himself trapped on the Ferris wheel with the seats coming loose. After being rescued by LongArm, Baddin decides to change his ways and become a good prince rather than a spoiled bad prince leading the king to change his name to from Baddin to Goodin.\n* Nancy and Kathleen \u2014 Nightshade&#39;s sisters.&lt;!-- Both of them? --&gt;\n* Greasy \u2014 A cellmate of Rock Krusher&#39;s at Greystone Prison.\n* Audrey Ferrer\n* Samantha \u2014 A tomboy who helps the COPS out during an investigation Doctor Badvibes\u2019 circus.\n* Captain Crimefighter \u2014 Cindy Johnson is a teenage girl who dreams of being a superhero.
