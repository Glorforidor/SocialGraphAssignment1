They have been the main characters of three successive [[comic book]] series, which were [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of the [[X-Men]] franchise.\n\nThe first team of New Mutants characters was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]]. They first appeared in  ''[[The New Mutants (graphic novel)|The New Mutants]]'' (September 1982), part of the [[line (comics)|line]] ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'', and are subsequently featured in their own title from 1983 until 1991. Like its parent title, ''The New Mutants'' highlighted interpersonal and group conflict as well as action and adventure, and featured a large ensemble cast. With the end of the first series, the characters were relaunched as [[X-Force]] in a new, eponymous series.\n\nThe second ''New Mutants'' series, launched in 2003, featured a new group of teenage mutants. Unlike the original New Mutants, they were part of a huge cast of [[List of Xavier Institute students and staff|students at the Xavier Institute]]. In 2004, it was relaunched as ''New X-Men: Academy X,'' after which the central group was formally dubbed the \"New Mutants.\" In the aftermath of the \"[[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]\" [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline in late 2005, the remaining students were merged into one junior team, the [[New X-Men]].\n\nThe third ''New Mutants'' series, reuniting most of the original team, was launched in May 2009.\n\nA [[The New Mutants (film)|horror film]] featuring the New Mutants was released on August 28, 2020.<ref name=\"Mar2020ReleaseDelay\">{{Cite news |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/mulan-new-mutants-antlers-moved-coronavirus-1202881355/ |title=\u2018Mulan\u2019, \u2018New Mutants\u2019 & \u2018Antlers\u2019 Moved By Disney As Coronavirus Grips Release Schedule |date=March 12, 2020 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 15, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312222510/https://deadline.com/2020/03/mulan-new-mutants-antlers-moved-coronavirus-1202881355/ |archive-date=March 12, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n== ''The New Mutants'', volume 1 ==\nBy the early 1980s, ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' (under the authorship of [[Chris Claremont]]) had become one of the comic book industry's most successful titles, prompting Marvel editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] to launch ''The New Mutants'', the first of several ''[[X-Men]]'' spin-offs. ''X-Men'' editor [[Louise Simonson]] recalled \"Neither Chris [Claremont] or I really wanted to do it. We wanted ''X-Men'' to be special and by itself, but Shooter told us that if we didn't come up with a new 'mutant' book, someone else would.\"<ref name=\"PoorDoug\">{{cite news | last = Grant | first= Paul J. | date = August 1993 | title = Poor Dead Doug, and Other Mutant Memories | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 66\u201369}}</ref> The name was a modification of [[Stan Lee]]'s original name for the X-Men, \"The Mutants\".<ref name=\"PoorDoug\"/>\n\nThe New Mutants were teenaged students of [[X-Mansion|Professor Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] and wore matching uniforms, much like the original X-Men, who had since grown into adulthood.<ref name=\"back29\">{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Bruce |title=The New Mutants: From Superhero Spin-Off to Sci-Fi/Fantasy|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29|pages=62\u201368 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> These students, however, rather resembled the \"all-new, all-different X-Men\" of their era in terms of ethnic diversity.\n\nThe original team consisted of:\n\n* '''[[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]''' (Samuel Guthrie), a 16-year-old from [[Kentucky]], [[United States]] and eventual co-leader, with the ability to generate thermo-chemical energy and propel himself through the air.\n* '''[[Karma (comics)|Karma]]''' (Xi'an Coy Manh), a 19-year-old girl from [[Vietnam]] and the team's original leader, who could mentally possess other people's bodies.\n* '''[[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]]''' (Danielle Moonstar, originally codenamed Psyche), a girl who is a [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and eventual co-leader after Karma's apparent death, who could create visual [[empathy|empathic]] three-dimensional illusions.\n* '''[[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]''' (Roberto da Costa), a 14-year-old from [[Brazil]] who had [[superhuman strength]] fueled by sunlight and could store solar energy in his body to use his super strength.\n* '''[[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]''' (Rahne Sinclair), a 13-year-old religious girl from [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom]] who could transform into a [[wolf]] and a [[werewolf]]-like creature.\n\nThe team was intended to debut in their own series. However, as the first issue was nearing completion, Shooter ordered it to be reworked into a graphic novel so that ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' could make its deadline for the next issue. Thus, the New Mutants debuted in ''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #4 (December 1982), which continued a plotline from ''Uncanny X-Men.'' (Despite this, the graphic novel missed its shipping slot by two weeks due to artist [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]]'s [[honeymoon]].)<ref name=\"PoorDoug\" />\n\nThe series was originally written by Claremont and illustrated by McLeod, the team's co-creators, but McLeod soon passed artistic duties on to [[Sal Buscema]]. McLeod was unprepared for the demands of doing both pencils and inks on a monthly book, prompting him to have Buscema do the breakdowns after the first three issues, and left entirely after issue #8 when he began to lose interest in the stories.<ref name=\"back29\"/> Claremont gave the series a darker tone, which was heightened with the arrival of artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]]. Sienkiewicz's avant garde art style and painted covers broke through the conventional comic book boundaries of the day and helped ''The New Mutants'' stand out on the shelf.<ref name=\"back29\"/>\n\nIn addition to very serious depictions of teenage angst and growing pains, the series featured themes of [[mysticism]]. The stories also relied on wilder, more far-fetched premises than were typical of ''X-Men'' at the time, shaping into more of a [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] series than the superhero coming-of-age comic it had been touted as in its early days.<ref name=\"back29\"/> Locales included demonic dimensions, alternate futures, and an ancient Roman civilization hidden within the [[Amazon rainforest]]. The New Mutants also encountered a secret society called the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], and began a rivalry with their young apprentices, the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]].\n\nAfter the apparent death of Karma, Cannonball and Dani Moonstar act as co-leaders.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #7 (September 1983)</ref> New recruits included:\n\n* '''[[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]]''' (Douglas Ramsey), an otherwise ordinary young man who could learn to read or speak any language rapidly, whether it was human, alien, or machine, making him an unmatched computer expert.\n* '''[[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]]''' (Illyana Rasputin), sister of the [[Russia]]n X-Man [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and long-time resident of the X-Mansion, an accomplished mystic who could open \"teleportation discs\" allowing travel to [[Otherplace|Limbo]] and from there, any point on [[Earth]].\n* '''[[Magma (comics)|Magma]]''' (Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla), a fiercely tempered native of a secret [[Rome|Roman]] society in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] who can control [[lava]].<ref name=\"back29\"/>\n* '''[[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]]''', an extraterrestrial of the [[techno-organic virus|techno-organic]] race known as the [[Technarchy]]. Considered a pariah due to the uncommon trait of empathy. \n\nA supplementary ''New Mutants Annual'' series began in 1984. These annuals were always written by whoever was the regular ''New Mutants'' writer at the time and often included significant changes to the status quo which were not explained in the parent series so that readers would have to buy ''New Mutants Annual'' in order to follow events in both series.1985 annual was solicited as ''New Mutants Annual'' #2, but published as ''New Mutants Special Edition'' #1 because it exceeded the maximum page count for an annual.<ref>\"Report Card\" letters page, ''The New Mutants'' #30 (August 1985).</ref>\n\nIn 1986, [[Professor X]] was written out of the series. Before he left, he made the X-Men's one-time nemesis, [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], headmaster of his school.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #200 (December 1985)</ref> Magneto would be the team's longest-running headmaster, holding the position from ''New Mutants'' #35 through to #75. Fiercely overprotective of his students, particularly after the events of the \"[[Mutant Massacre]]\" and \"[[Fall of the Mutants]]\", he was increasingly used as an uptight [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for the adventurous New Mutants, setting rules that they would inevitably break in the interests of helping their friends.\n\nWith Claremont taking on ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' and ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'', he left ''The New Mutants'' and the series was turned over to writer [[Louise Simonson]] and illustrator [[Bret Blevins]] with issue #55 (Sept. 1987). Simonson was intended to be only a fill-in writer for the six months Claremont needed to get the two new series launched, but he ultimately remained with his new projects, and Simonson ended up writing the series for over three years.<ref name=\"PoorDoug\"/> During her run, Magma is written out of the book,<ref>''The New Mutants'' #57 (November 1987). Marvel Comics.</ref> and Magik is de-aged back to childhood.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #73 (March 1989). Marvel Comics.</ref> Due to his unpopularity with New Mutants readers and artists, Cypher is killed off in ''The New Mutants'' #60 (February 1988). Simonson recalled, \"He wasn't fun to draw. He just stood around and hid behind a tree during a fight... Every artist who ever did him said 'Can't we kill this guy?' We would get letters from fans about how much they hated him.\"<ref name=\"PoorDoug\" /> Simonson also folded the [[X-Terminators]], a group of young wards from ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', into the New Mutants.<ref>''The New Mutants'' #76 (June 1989)</ref>\n\nThe X-Terminators added to the team were:\n\n* '''[[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]]''' (Tabitha Smith), a teen runaway who could create \"plasma bombs.\"\n* '''[[Rusty Collins|Firefist]]''' (Rusty Collins), a [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] wanted by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]].\n* '''[[Rictor]]''' (Julio Richter), a young [[Mexico|Mexican]] who could create [[shock wave]]s.\n* '''[[Skids (comics)|Skids]]''' (Sally Blevins), a former [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] who could project a frictionless [[force shield|force field]] around her body.\n\nIn 1989, Simonson crafted a saga in which the team journeyed to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], the home of the gods of [[Norse mythology]]. The storyline wrote Dani Moonstar out of the series, as she joined the Norse pantheon as one of the [[Valkyrior]].<ref name=autogenerated1>''The New Mutants'' #87 (March 1990)</ref> However, the most controversial issue of her run was New Mutants #64. Titled \"Instant Replay!\", the story deals with the New Mutants' mourning for Cypher, and includes a scene in which Warlock attempts to resurrect Cypher by taking his corpse out of its coffin and showing it to Cypher's loved ones. Simonson holds it to be her favorite New Mutants story, though she acknowledges that many readers found it too morbid.<ref name=\"PoorDoug\" />\n\nSales of the series had slumped for several years, but took a sharp upturn after [[Rob Liefeld]] took over the penciling and co-plotting chores at the end of 1989.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} A new mentor for the group, the mysterious mercenary [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], was introduced,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> further helping sales. Over the next year, several longtime team members were written out or killed off. However, the relationship between Liefeld and Simonson was fraught with tension, and Simonson claims that editor [[Bob Harras]] dealt with the situation by rewriting her plots and dialogue so that the characterizations did not make sense: \"Although I wasn't being fired, I think I was being shoved out the door with both hands by Bob Harras. Bob was only doing what he had to do, I expect, which was make Rob Liefeld happy.\"<ref name=\"PoorDoug\" /> Simonson eventually gave in, leaving after issue #97. When Liefeld and [[Fabian Nicieza]], who wrote dialogue based on Liefeld's plots, took over as writers of the final three issues of the series, they included several harder-edged characters:\n\n* '''[[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|\"Domino\"]]''' (Vanessa Geraldine Carlysle), Cable's pale-skinned, black-garbed mercenary lover. Actually Copycat, impersonating [[Domino (comics)|Domino]].\n* '''[[Feral (comics)|Feral]]''' (Maria Callasantos), who possessed a bestial temperament and appearance.\n* '''[[Shatterstar]]''' (Gaveedra Seven), a swashbuckling warrior from another dimension.\n* '''[[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]''' (James Proudstar), the younger brother of slain X-Man [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|Thunderbird]] and a former Hellion, an [[Apache]] who possessed super strength and speed.\n\n''The New Mutants'' was cancelled in 1991 with issue #100, but the new platoon-like team formed by Cable continued in ''[[X-Force]]'', a successful series (whose first issue sold approximately one million copies){{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} that would continue until 2002, and feature a variety of the former ''New Mutants'' cast.\n\n===Volume 1 cast===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\" border=\"1\"\n|+Members of New Mutants\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Issues\n! scope=\"col\" | Characters\n|-\n| #1\u20136\n| [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], [[Danielle Moonstar|Psyche]], [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]\n|-\n| #7\u201311\n| Wolfsbane, Psyche, Sunspot, Cannonball\n|-\n| #12\u201314\n| Wolfsbane, Psyche, Sunspot, Cannonball, [[Magma (comics)|Magma]]\n|-\n| #15\u201320\n| Wolfsbane, Psyche, Sunspot, Cannonball, Magma, [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]]\n|-\n| #21\u201333\n| Wolfsbane, Mirage, Sunspot, Cannonball, Magma, Magik, [[Warlock (comics)|Warlock]], [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]] (''rotating'')\n|-\n| #34\u201336\n| Wolfsbane, Karma, Mirage, Sunspot, Cannonball, Magma, Magik, Warlock, Cypher\n|-\n| #37\u201342\n| Wolfsbane, Karma, Mirage, Cannonball, Magma, Magik, Warlock, Cypher\n|-\n| #43\u201354\n| Wolfsbane, Karma, Mirage, Sunspot, Cannonball, Magma, Magik, Warlock, Cypher\n|-\n| #55\u201356\n| Wolfsbane, Mirage, Sunspot, Cannonball, Magma, Magik, Warlock, Cypher\n|-\n| #57\n| Wolfsbane, Mirage, Sunspot, Cannonball, Magma, Magik, Warlock, Cypher, [[Bird-Brain (Marvel Comics)|Bird-Brain]]\n|-\n| #58\u201360\n| Wolfsbane, Mirage, Sunspot, Cannonball, Magik, Warlock, Cypher, Bird-Brain\n|-\n| #61\u201365\n| Wolfsbane, Mirage, Sunspot, Cannonball, Magik, Warlock\n|-\n| #66\u201375\n| Wolfsbane, Mirage, Sunspot, Cannonball, Magik, Warlock, [[Gosamyr]]\n|-\n| #76\u201377\n| Wolfsbane, Mirage, Sunspot, Cannonball, Magik, Warlock, [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], [[Rusty Collins|Firefist]], [[Rictor]], [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]]\n|-\n| #78\u201387\n| Wolfsbane, Mirage, Sunspot, Cannonball, Warlock, Skids, Firefist, Rictor, Boom-Boom\n|-\n| #88\u201395\n| Wolfsbane, Sunspot, Cannonball, Warlock, Rictor, Boom-Boom, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]\n|-\n| #96\u201397\n| Wolfsbane, Sunspot, Cannonball, Rictor, Boom-Boom, Cable\n|-\n| #98\n| Sunspot, Cannonball, Rictor, Boom-Boom, Cable, [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]\n|-\n| #99\n| Sunspot, Cannonball, Boom-Boom, Cable, Domino, [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]\n|-\n| #100\n| Cannonball, Boom-Boom, Cable, Domino, [[Shatterstar]], [[Feral (comics)|Feral]]\n|}\n\n===Volume 1 collected editions===\n\n''The New Mutants'' has been reprinted in several trade paperbacks, some containing specific story arcs (such as the \"Demon Bear Saga\" by [[Chris Claremont|Claremont]] and [[Bill Sienkiewicz|Sienkiewicz]]), and some collected as part of a larger crossover of the various X-titles.

The series would continue for 13 issues, until June 2004, before being relaunched as ''[[New X-Men|New X-Men: Academy X]]'' in July 2004, with a new #1.\n\nThe series featured a handful of the dozens of mutant teenagers attending the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], as well as their instructors, which included various [[X-Men]] as well as former members of the original New Mutants ([[Karma (comics)|Karma]], [[Magma (comics)|Magma]], [[Danielle Moonstar|Dani Moonstar]], and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]).\n\nThe featured group of students never refer to themselves as \"the New Mutants\" before the series relaunch as ''New X-Men: Academy X'' in 2004, and the reorganization of the Xavier Institute student body into various training squads. The New Mutants, advised by Dani Moonstar, were:\n\n* '''[[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]]''' (Josh Foley) \u2013 Josh is an [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)#Omega-level mutants|Omega-Level mutant]] who can manipulate his or others' biologies to heal or harm. In addition, Elixir possesses gold skin which converts to black when he uses his powers offensively. He was one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain his powers after \"M-Day\".  He was seemingly killed by the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]] before returning with vastly enhanced abilities.  He is currently taking refuge in Tibet with [[Shen Xorn|Xorn]].\n* '''[[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]]''' (Joshua \"Jay\" Guthrie) \u2013 Jay possesses red angelic wings on his back that allow him to fly and which grant him an accelerated healing process. Furthermore, he possesses the ability to manipulate his own voice. He was one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain his powers after \"M-Day\". Jay's wings are amputated by [[William Stryker|Stryker]],<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2, #23 (April 2006)</ref> who later kills him.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2, #27 (August 2006)</ref>\n* '''[[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]]''' (David Alleyne) \u2013 David was the team's co-leader who could temporarily gain the knowledge and skills of those near him. Although he was de-powered after \"M-Day\", he has retained all the knowledge he had acquired prior to the \"Decimation\".<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2, #43 (December 2007)</ref> Current member of the Young Avengers.\n* '''[[Surge (comics)|Surge]]''' (Noriko Ashida) \u2013 Noriko is [[Japanese people|Japanese]]. She absorbs electricity from her environment which she can discharge as powerful electric blasts or utilize as superhuman speed. She requires mechanical gauntlets to prevent overcharge. Surge was one of the 27 students at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] to retain her powers after \"M-Day\". She is currently a student of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.\n* '''[[Wallflower (comics)|Wallflower]]''' (Laurie Collins) \u2013 Laurie is a shy girl who generates highly potent [[pheromone]]s that influence people's emotions. She was one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain her powers after \"M-Day\". Laurie was later killed by one of [[William Stryker|Stryker]]'s men.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2, #25 (June 2006)</ref>\n* '''[[Wind Dancer]]''' (Sofia Mantega) \u2013 Sofia was the other co-leader and was a temperamental aerokinetic who was particularly adept at using this power to manipulate sound. She was depowered after \"M-Day\" and joined a group of fellow ex-mutants as part of the [[New Warriors]].  Donning a variety of mechanical gear, she took up the codename Renascence before the group disbanded.  Her current whereabouts are unknown.\n* '''[[Wither (comics)|Wither]]''' (Kevin Ford) \u2013 Kevin could cause organic material to decay with his touch. He eventually switches to the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]] squad.<ref>''New X-Men: Academy X'' #6 (December 2004)</ref> He is later killed by Elixir.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3, #25 (Released March 2010, Published May 2010)</ref>\n\nAnother such group, advised by Emma Frost, was known as the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]] and, like their predecessor, was the arch-rival of the New Mutants. Whereas the original ''New Mutants'' series revolved around battles with world-threatening menaces, ''New Mutants'' volume 2 focused on the characters' personal relationships and struggles with controlling their powers.\n\nAfter \"[[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]\", the cataclysmic event that decimated the world's mutant population, only 27 of the 182 students enrolled at the Xavier Institute retained their powers. The New Mutants and the other training squads were disbanded, and the remaining students were folded into a single junior team, the New X-Men.<ref>''New X-Men'' vol 2, #23 (April 2006)</ref>\n\n===Volume 2 cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+Members of the New Mutants\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Issues\n! scope=\"col\" | Characters\n|-\n| #1\n| {{hlist|[[Danielle Moonstar]]|[[Wind Dancer]]{{efn|group=lower-a|As Sofia Montega}}}}\n|-\n| #2\n| {{hlist|Danielle Moonstar|[[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]]{{efn|group=lower-b|As Julian Keller until issue #9}}|[[Wallflower (comics)|Wallflower]]{{efn|group=lower-c|As Laurie Collins}}|Wind Dancer}}\n|-\n| #3\n| {{hlist|Danielle Moonstar|Hellion|Wallflower|Wind Dancer|[[Wither (comics)|Wither]]{{efn|group=lower-d|As Kevin Ford}}}}\n|-\n| #4\n| {{hlist|Danielle Moonstar|[[Karma (comics)|Karma]]|[[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]]{{efn|group=lower-e|As David Alleyne}}}}\n|-\n| #5\n| {{hlist|Danielle Moonstar|[[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]]{{efn|group=lower-f|As Josh Foley}}|Hellion|Karma|Wallflower|Wind Dancer|Wither}}\n|-\n| #6\n| {{hlist|Danielle Moonstar|Elixir|Karma|Prodigy|Wallflower|Wind Dancer|Wither}}\n|-\n| #7&ndash;8\n| {{hlist|Danielle Moonstar|Elixir|Hellion|Karma|Prodigy|Wallflower|Wind Dancer}}\n|-\n| #9&ndash;10\n| {{hlist|Danielle Moonstar|Elixir|Hellion|Karma|Prodigy|[[Surge (comics)|Surge]]{{efn|group=lower-g|As Noriko Ashida}}|Wallflower|Wind Dancer|[[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]}}\n|-\n| #11\n| {{hlist|Elixir|Wallflower|Wolfsbane}}\n|-\n| #12\n| {{hlist|Danielle Moonstar|Elixir|Hellion|Karma|Prodigy|Surge|Wallflower|Wind Dancer|Wolfsbane}}\n|-\n| #13\n| {{hlist|[[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]|Danielle Moonstar|Elixir|Karma|[[Magma (comics)|Magma]]|Prodigy|Surge|[[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]|Wallflower|Wind Dancer|Wolfsbane}}\n|-\n|}\n\n{{Notelist}}\n\n===Volume 2 collected editions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+''New Mutants'' volume 2 collected editions\n|-\n!

The series was initially written by [[Zeb Wells]] and pencilled by Diogenes Neves with the titular characters forming a new field team for the [[X-Men]].

Magik shows up at the X-Men headquarters in San Francisco, claiming to be from the future and warning that Dani Moonstar and Karma are in danger. Once tests show that Illyanna is not an imposter, Cannonball leads a rescue mission with her.

Other denizens of Terra include Rain's lady-in-waiting [[Tabitha Smith#Rahne of Terra|Tabby]] (Boom-Boom), the knights [[Rictor|Richard]] (Rictor),  [[Sunspot (comics)|Robert]] (Sunspot), and [[Cannonball (comics)|Samuel]] (Cannonball) and the peasant boy [[Cypher (comics)#Geshem|Douglas]] (Cypher). The Terrans all duplicate the powers of their counterparts in one way or another.<ref>''Wolverine: Rahne of Terra'' (Aug. 1991)</ref>\n\n=== ''New Mutants: Truth or Death'' ===\nIn 1997, a three-issue reunion series written by [[Ben Raab]] and illustrated by [[Bernard Chang]], ''New Mutants: Truth or Death,'' featured the young New Mutants traveling forward in time to meet their older, jaded selves in [[X-Force]].\n\n===Worst X-Man Ever===\nHere the New Mutants consist of X-Ceptional, who can explode permanently, Riches, who turns whatever he touches to gold, Minerva, who can manipulate reality, and Riches' sister Rags. Riches kills Professor X and takes over the world. Rags begins a relationship with Gambit, and Minerva goes to pure idea. X-Ceptional grabs Riches and explodes, killing them both.<ref>X-Men: Worst X-Man Ever #1\u20135</ref>\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nIn ''[[Ultimate X-Men]],'' the '''Academy of Tomorrow''' (previously called New Mutants) is founded by [[Emma Frost#Ultimate Marvel|Emma Frost]]. It is loosely linked to the X-Men via Emma Frost's professional relationship with her former lover and teacher [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Charles Xavier]]. This Academy accepts any talented students, regardless of their genetic status. The team is headed by a non-telepathic and more pacifistic version of [[Emma Frost#Ultimate Marvel|Emma Frost]] and headed by field leader [[Havok (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Havok]]. During ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'', the Academy of Tomorrow is destroyed in a terrorist attack by [[Jamie Madrox#Ultimate Marvel|Multiple Man]].<ref>''Ultimatum'' #3 (May 2009)</ref> Former members include [[Warren Worthington III#Ultimate Marvel|Angel]], Beast, [[Cannonball (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Cannonball]], [[Cypher (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Cypher]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Dazzler]], [[Karma (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Karma]], [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Polaris]], and [[Sunspot (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Sunspot]].\n\n== In other media ==\n=== Television ===\n* The animated TV series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' (2000\u20132003) featured a group called the New Mutants who, like their [[comic book]] counterparts, were a junior team living at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] concurrently with the [[X-Men]]. The team featured [[Tabitha Smith#X-Men: Evolution|Boom-Boom]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Magma (comics)|Magma]], [[Sunspot (comics)#Television|Sunspot]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]. Other members, such as [[Berzerker (comics)|Berzerker]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], and [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]] were not New Mutants in the comic book series, but were featured in other X-Men comics. [[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]] also appeared in the show's penultimate episode where she joined the team in a dream she projected into [[Shadowcat]]'s head.\n* ''New Mutants'' is the name given to the \"race\" of Mutants on the television show [[Mutant X (TV series)|Mutant X]].\n\n=== Film ===\n* The live-action film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) featured several of the New Mutants characters in supporting roles, namely [[Blink (comics)|Clarice Ferguson / Blink]], [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar / Warpath]], and [[Sunspot (comics)|Robert da Costa / Sunspot]] portrayed by [[Fan Bingbing]], [[Booboo Stewart]] and [[Adan Canto]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKAP6Uv_pBU |title=X-Men: Days of Future Past Comic-Con 2013 \u2013 Full Panel|date=July 21, 2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/xmen/blink.asp |title=Empire X-Men: Days Of Future Past Exclusive \u2013 Blink Cover|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/xmen/warpath.asp |title=Empire X-Men: Days Of Future Past Exclusive \u2013 Warpath Cover|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/adancanto/status/349260053230002177 |title=Twitter / adancanto: \"@ghosthunter: @X4X5Campaign I'm excited for @adancanto as Sunspot!!\" Thanks!
