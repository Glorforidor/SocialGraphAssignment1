Some characters from the &#39;&#39;Sgt.

Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Frank Giacoia]].]]\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D. was presented as an extant, full-blown entity in its first appearance, with [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] in charge of the Special Weaponry section and Fury seeing \&quot;some of the most famous joes from every nation\&quot; (then \&quot;half the leaders of the free world\&quot; a page later) at a meeting of the Supreme International Council.&lt;ref name=\&quot;StrangeTales135\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #135: \&quot;The Man For The Job!\&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Much was revealed over the years to fill in its labyrinthine organizational history. Stan Lee wrote each story, abetted by artist Kirby&#39;s co-plotting or full plotting, through &#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #152 (Jan. 1967), except for two issues, one scripted by Kirby himself (#148) and one by [[Dennis O&#39;Neil]] (#149). Following an issue scripted by [[Roy Thomas]] (#153), and one co-written by Thomas and new series artist [[Jim Steranko]], came the sole-writer debut of soon-to-become industry legend Steranko\u2014who had begun on the feature as a [[penciller]]-[[inker]] of Kirby layouts in #151 (Dec. 1966), taken over the every-other-issue \&quot;Nick Fury\&quot; cover art with #153 two months later, and full writing with #155 (April 1967).\n\nSteranko quickly established the feature as one of comics history&#39;s most groundbreaking, innovative and acclaimed. [[Ron Goulart]] wrote,\n{{quote|[E]ven the dullest of readers could sense that something new was happening. \u2026 Which each passing issue Steranko&#39;s efforts became more and more innovative. Entire pages would be devoted to [[photomontage|photocollage]]s of drawings [that] ignored panel boundaries and instead worked together on planes of depth. The first pages \u2026 became incredible production numbers similar in design to the [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] [[rock concert]] [[poster]] of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Comix: A History of Comic Books in America|first=Ron|last=Goulart|publisher=Bonanza Books|location= New York City|year= 1971}} Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 75-169-104&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\n[[Larry Hama]] said Steranko \&quot;combined the figurative dynamism of Jack Kirby with modern design concepts. The [[graphic design|graphic influences]] of [[Peter Max]], Op Art and [[Andy Warhol]] were embedded into the design of the pages \u2014 and the pages were designed as a whole, not just as a series of panels. All this, executed in a crisp, hard-edged style, seething with drama and anatomical tension\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Larry|last=Hama| authorlink=Larry Hama|chapter=Introduction|title=Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Who Is Scorpio?|publisher=Marvel Enterprises|year= 2001|isbn= 0-7851-0766-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe series won 1967 and 1968 [[Alley Award]]s, and was inducted in the latter year to the awards&#39; Hall of Fame. Steranko himself was inducted into the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Comic Book Hall of Fame]] in 2006. The 12-page feature ran through &#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #168 (sharing that \&quot;split book\&quot; with the occult feature \&quot;[[Doctor Strange]]\&quot; each issue), after which it was spun off onto its own series of the same title, running 15 issues (June 1968\u2013Nov. 1969), followed by three all-reprint issues beginning a year later (Nov. 1970\u2013March 1971). Steranko wrote and drew issues #1\u20133 and #5, and drew the covers of #1\u20137.\n\nNew S.H.I.E.L.D. stories would not appear for nearly two decades after the first solo title. A six-issue [[miniseries]], &#39;&#39;Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;&#39; (June\u2013Nov. 1988) was followed by &#39;&#39;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;&#39; &lt;!--official title per postal indicia, per GCD--&gt; (vol. 2).&lt;!--month and date needed--&gt; This second series lasted 47 issues (Sept. 1989\u2013May 1993); its pivotal story arc was \&quot;the Deltite Affair\&quot;, in which many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were replaced with [[Life Model Decoy]] androids in a takeover attempt.\n\nA year after that series ended, the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] &#39;&#39;Fury&#39;&#39; (May 1994) [[retconned]] the events of those previous two series, recasting them as a series of staged events designed to distract Fury from the resurrection plans of Hydra head von Strucker. The following year, writer [[Howard Chaykin]] and penciler Corky Lehmkuhl produced the four-issue miniseries &#39;&#39;Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;&#39; (April\u2013July 1995). Various publications have additionally focused on Nick Fury&#39;s solo adventures, such as the [[graphic novel]]s and one-shots &#39;&#39;[[Wolverine/Nick Fury: The Scorpio Connection]]&#39;&#39; (1989), &#39;&#39;[[Wolverine/Nick Fury: Scorpio Rising]]&#39;&#39; (Oct. 1994), &#39;&#39;[[Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Captain America and Nick Fury: Blood Truce]]&#39;&#39; (both Feb. 1995), and &#39;&#39;[[Captain America and Nick Fury: The Otherworld War]]&#39;&#39; (Oct. 2001).\n\n===Titles===\n{{See also|List of Nick Fury titles}}\n\n====Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.====\n{{Main|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

General Assembly Resolutions]] and legislation passed in signatory nations aiding many of their operations.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Amazing Fantasy]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #7 (June 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;mnyc\&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 62\u201363 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-416-53141-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, S.H.I.E.L.D. has been inconsistently portrayed as under U.S., rather than U.N., control - for instance, in &#39;&#39;[[Astonishing X-Men]]&#39;&#39; #3, Nick Fury explains S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s inaction during an incident of genocide by stating that it did not occur on American soil.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Astonishing X-Men]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #3 (September 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D. started off as a top secret international organization (Fury was unaware of them when he was in the CIA) with a Supreme International Council made up of top officials and minds from across the world, including Tony Stark.&lt;ref name=\&quot;StrangeTales135\&quot;/&gt; Its first director was Rick Stoner, former head of the CIA, but he was quickly assassinated by Hydra,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Fury&#39;&#39; #1 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[President of the United States]] recommended Nick Fury take the role.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #135: \&quot;The Man For The Job!\&quot; (page 2: \&quot;Spy guys like &#39;&#39;me&#39;&#39; are a dime a dozen!\&quot; \&quot;The White House thinks &#39;&#39;differently&#39;&#39;, Fury!\&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, the ultimate authority of S.H.I.E.L.D. is revealed to be a cabal of 12 mysterious men and women who give Fury his orders and operational structure, leaving Fury to manage the actual implementation of these orders and stratagems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Bob Harras|Harras, Bob]]|penciller= [[Paul Neary|Neary, Paul]]|inker= DeMulder, Kim|story= The Delta Equation (Nick Fury Vs S.H.I.E.L.D.

First, the supervillain [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]] stole the technology and used it to create the second team of villains called the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]. Later, some LMDs known as the Deltites achieved sentience and infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra both, replacing key members until Fury defeated them. This led to the disbanding of the original organization and its replacement by a new task force with the same acronym under the control of the U.N.

His first successor was not one of his closer associates but a relatively unknown newcomer to the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy, [[Maria Hill]]. A transcript of a conversation between Hill and the [[President of the United States]]&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret War&#39;&#39; #5 (Dec. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; revealed she was chosen for the post by [[United Nations]] consensus to keep Fury loyalists out of the job and to keep relations with the superhero community to a minimum.{{issue|date=April 2014}} The President also expected Hill \u2014 an [[United States|America]]n \u2014 to be loyal first to the U.S., despite S.H.I.E.L.D. being a U.N.-chartered organization.{{issue|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe passage of the United States&#39; [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and the subsequent superhero \&quot;Civil War\&quot; created an additional political and ethical irritant between S.H.I.E.L.D. and the superhuman community, with S.H.I.E.L.D. tasked to lead enforcement and to take on registered superheroes as operatives.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]&#39;&#39; #1-7 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007), and related series&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nToward the end of the conflict, Hill concluded she had been made director with the intent that she fail at the job, and she proposes to [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] that he assume the post himself, with her as deputy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Stark accepts the appointment as director upon the conclusion of the superhuman Civil War, and undertakes a series of initiatives, including the construction of a new gold-and-red Helicarrier in the motif of his [[Iron Man]] armor designs, the introduction of a daycare center in the [[Helicarrier]], and an employee suggestion-box. While accused of treating S.H.I.E.L.D. as a Stark Industries subsidiary, he succeeded in streamlining the organization and raising morale.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man&#39;&#39; vol. 4, #15 (April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; S.H.I.E.L.D. fought a wave of global superhuman terrorism and was manipulated into two international incidents that almost saw Director Stark arrested, until they revealed [[Mandarin (comics)|the Mandarin]] to be behind it and stopped him from committing genocide with an Extremis pathogen.\n\nAt the start of the &#39;&#39;[[Secret Invasion]]&#39;&#39; by the extraterrestrial shape-shifting race the [[Skrulls]], the Helicarrier is disabled by a Skrull virus and left floating and disabled in the [[Bermuda Triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Invasion&#39;&#39; #1 (June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The Skrulls by this point have already replaced a large number of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, including the high-ranking [[Dum Dum Dugan|Timothy \&quot;Dum-Dum\&quot; Dugan]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Invasion Prologue&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt; After the invasion is repelled, the President of the United States decides to dissolve S.H.I.E.L.D.,&lt;ref name=\&quot;swarriors1\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Warriors&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt; and has it, the [[Fifty State Initiative]], and the Avengers replaced by the Thunderbolts Initiative, which is placed under the supervision of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Invasion&#39;&#39; #8 (December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOsborn uses the opportunity to transform S.H.I.E.L.D. into a new organization called \&quot;[[H.A.M.M.E.R.]]\&quot;, formed by loyal agents of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] Initiative as well as former agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra.&lt;ref name=\&quot;davengers2\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Dark Avengers&#39;&#39; #2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] are officially disbanded in the process as well and turned into a black-ops force that answers only to Osborn. Meanwhile, H.A.M.M.E.R. also operates alongside the newest, and only government-sponsored Avengers team, the [[Dark Avengers]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;davengers1\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Dark Avengers&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter the Invasion, Fury discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. itself had been under the control of the terrorist organization Hydra ostensibly from its very beginning.&lt;ref name=\&quot;swarriors1\&quot;/&gt;\n\nAfter the conclusion of the &#39;&#39;[[Secret Warriors (comic book)|Secret Warriors]]&#39;&#39; ongoing series, S.H.I.E.L.D. was reformed with Fury leaving it under the control of its new director, [[Daisy Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Battle Scars&#39;&#39; #2&lt;/ref&gt; The new S.H.I.E.L.D. subsequently saved US Army Ranger [[Nick Fury Jr.|Marcus Johnson]] from mercenaries hired by the [[Leviathan (Marvel Comics)|Leviathan]]. When he discovered he was the son of Nick Fury, Marcus (whose birth name was Nick Fury Jr.) and his army friend [[Phil Coulson]] joined S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Battle Scars&#39;&#39; #6 (June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Hill and the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D. later formed their incarnation of the [[Secret Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Avengers&#39;&#39; vol. 2, #1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the &#39;&#39;[[Avengers: Standoff!]]&#39;&#39; storyline, S.H.I.E.L.D. establishes a [[gated community]] called Pleasant Hills to serve as a super villain prison. Using technology derived from the [[Cosmic Cube]] called Kobik, S.H.I.E.L.D. converts the inmates into the mild-mannered residents of Pleasant Hills.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hills&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Organizational structure and procedure===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}\n\nOver the decades, various writers have depicted S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s organizational structure in several different ways. &#39;&#39;[[The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]&#39;&#39; (first edition) describes an eight-level ranking structure (technician, administrator, field agent, regional officer, special officer, regional director, special director, executive director), although providing almost no detail on other aspects of the Directorate&#39;s internal makeup. Years later, the miniseries &#39;&#39;Agents of Atlas&#39;&#39; mentioned a position of \&quot;sub director\&quot;, and seemed to indicate that the administrative department of S.H.I.E.L.D. it itself referred to simply as \&quot;Directorate\&quot;.\n\nMost of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s agents are normal humans. At one point the organization attempted to set up a team of superhuman agents, composed of Marvel Man (the future [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]), [[Texas Twister]], [[Blue Streak (comics)#Blue Streak I|Blue Streak]] and the [[Vamp (comics)|Vamp]] but the latter two were secretly agents of the criminal organization [[Corporation (comics)|The Corporation]], and the team broke apart before it had its first official mission. A second team organized years later also lasted only a short while.\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D. does employ some superhumans, including in its Psi-Division, composed of [[telepathy|telepathic]] agents who deal with like menaces. S.H.I.E.L.D. also obtains help from independent heroes when their special abilities are needed. It has also accepted some superheroes and [[supervillain]]s as members, but not in a separate unit. (See \&quot;Membership\&quot;)\n\nIts headquarters is the [[Helicarrier]], a massive flying [[aircraft carrier]] kept airborne at all times and, among other things, containing a squadron of [[fighter aircraft|jet fighters]] and housing an intercontinental ballistic missile ([[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]). In addition, S.H.I.E.L.D. maintains strong ties to the [[superhero]] community, especially [[Captain America]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the [[Fantastic Four]], and often calls upon that community for aid on particular missions.\n\nIn the 2000s, depictions of S.H.I.E.L.D. imply a hierarchy of security clearance levels used either in place of, or alongside, the previously described rank structure. The security-clearance hierarchy operates on a scale ranging from \&quot;Level One\&quot;, the lowest, to \&quot;Level Ten\&quot;, described by Maria Hill, executive director at the time, as the highest security clearance anyone of any government can have. Hill&#39;s own clearance, cited in the &#39;&#39;[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]&#39;&#39; ongoing series, was Level Eight.\n\n===Prominent members===\n\n{{Main| List of S.H.I.E.L.D. members}}\nThroughout its existence, S.H.I.E.L.D. has been most prominently led by Nick Fury, with [[Maria Hill]] succeeding him in mid-2000s stories. She voluntarily stepped down in a 2007 story, becoming deputy director to [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. Other historically prominent members, who have appeared from the earliest stories to the modern day, include [[Dum Dum Dugan|Thaddeus \&quot;Dum Dum\&quot; Dugan]] and [[Gabe Jones|Gabriel \&quot;Gabe\&quot; Jones]], both veterans of Fury&#39;s World War II Howling Commandos, though their youthful longevity has not, unlike Fury&#39;s, been explained in Marvel continuity; [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine|Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine]]&lt;!-- Allegra is part of 1st name, not surname --&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;As spelled officially by Marvel Comics on [http://www.marvel.com/universe/S.H.I.E.L.D. its S.H.I.E.L.D. page], although misspelled with a male name and spelled with different Italian article as \&quot;Valentina Allegro de Fontaine\&quot; in her name&#39;s first two mentions, in &#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #159, \&quot;Spy School\&quot;, 10, panel 6, and &#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #162, \&quot;So Evil, the Night&#39;&#39; p.3, panel 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clay Quartermain]] (Agent 9); [[Jasper Sitwell]] (Agent 12); and [[Sharon Carter]] (Agent 13), all introduced in the 1960s; and [[Jimmy Woo]], introduced in the 1950s comic &#39;&#39;[[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]]&#39;&#39; and reintroduced in the &#39;&amp;nbsp;60s.\n\nPrior to the events of the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], Captain America estimated there to be 3,000 agents on active duty.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;New Avengers&#39;&#39; #21&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Bases of operation===\nAlthough the various Helicarriers built over the years have long been considered S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s primary mobile home base, the Directorate also maintains a number of land bases throughout the world, most notably \&quot;S.H.I.E.L.D. Central\&quot; in [[New York City]]. While some of these bases are publicly accessible on a limited basis, most are not publicly disclosed for reasons of planetary security. There are several fully equipped S.H.I.E.L.D. fall-out shelters scattered around the world, with twenty-eight of these being known only to Nick Fury. During the events of &#39;&#39;Civil War&#39;&#39;, Nick Fury was hiding in an American-based shelter. He also divulged the location of one to Captain America, so the Resistance to the Superhuman Registration Act could use it as a safe house.\n\n==Related organizations==\nThe following organizations are related to S.H.I.E.L.D.:\n\n===A.R.M.O.R.===\n&#39;&#39;&#39;A.R.M.O.R.&#39;&#39;&#39; (&#39;&#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39;&#39;ltered-&#39;&#39;&#39;R&#39;&#39;&#39;eality &#39;&#39;&#39;M&#39;&#39;&#39;onitoring and &#39;&#39;&#39;O&#39;&#39;&#39;perational &#39;&#39;&#39;R&#39;&#39;&#39;esponse Agency) is a sister agency to S.H.I.E.L.D. that monitors alternate reality incursions into [[Earth-616]]. It was introduced in the &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Zombies 3]]&#39;&#39; limited series, written by [[Fred Van Lente]]. Van Lente stated that A.R.M.O.R. \&quot;has existed with them this whole time, but it&#39;s been so incredibly secret that no one at Marvel knew about it\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=158856 WW PHILLY: FRED VAN LENTE ON MARVEL ZOMBIES 3 by Vaneta Rogers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107082025/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=158856 |date=2010-01-07 }}.

They were able to keep out of Osborn&#39;s clutches when their newest agent, [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|Lyra]] downloaded incriminating evidence against him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[All New Savage She-Hulk]]&#39;&#39; #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===H.A.M.M.E.R.===\n{{Main|H.A.M.M.E.R.}}\n&#39;&#39;&#39;H.A.M.M.E.R.&#39;&#39;&#39; replaces S.H.I.E.L.D. after it is dissolved when [[Norman Osborn]] is appointed the new head following the conclusion of the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull attack]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;davengers1\&quot;/&gt; It was not established what H.A.M.M.E.R. stands for; in &#39;&#39;Dark Avengers&#39;&#39; #1, Osborn told [[Victoria Hand]], the new Deputy Director, that it does stand for something, and when she asked what it stands for, he told her, \&quot;Get to work on it for me. That is one of the many things on your &#39;To Do&#39; list.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;davengers1\&quot;/&gt; Former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and members of Hydra are hired as agents. H.A.M.M.E.R. promotes Osborn&#39;s personal team of Avengers, a group composed mostly of former Thunderbolts members and former members of the Mighty Avengers. Osborn also eliminates all of Tony Stark&#39;s influence on S.H.I.E.L.D., including the Cape-Killer Armor and the Red and Gold Helicarrier. He also replaces all agents loyal to [[Nick Fury]], [[Captain America]], or [[Iron Man]] with agents loyal to himself. Also, in the &#39;&#39;[[Captain America: Reborn]]&#39;&#39; Prelude, when [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]], who is captured by H.A.M.M.E.R, asks what it stands for, the agent present says that it&#39;s classified and she does not have security clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/digitalcomics/view.htm?iid=12669&amp;title= |title=Captain America: Reborn Prelude Online Preview |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===S.P.E.A.R.===\n&#39;&#39;&#39;S.P.E.A.R.&#39;&#39;&#39;\u2014in the pages of &#39;&#39;[[Avengers World]]&#39;&#39;\u2014is a Chinese intelligence-gathering organization created for homeland security and has a flying headquarters called the Circle.

This unusual characteristic did not go unremarked; [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] referred to her as \&quot;Hydra-Hair\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Astonishing X-Men&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #6.\n\nA similar group as S.W.O.R.D., likewise affiliated with the U.N., is [[Starcore (comics)|Starcore]], which has worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. on several projects of joint interest, including establishing and maintaining a crewed facility on Earth&#39;s [[Moon]].\n\n===W.A.N.D.===\n&#39;&#39;&#39;W.A.N.D.&#39;&#39;&#39; (&#39;&#39;&#39;W&#39;&#39;&#39;izardry, &#39;&#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39;&#39;lchemy and &#39;&#39;&#39;N&#39;&#39;&#39;ecromancy &#39;&#39;&#39;D&#39;&#39;&#39;epartment) is a division of S.H.I.E.L.D that specializes in matters relating to magic.

Formed by a human coalition of former scientists and espionage agents from the ranks of S.H.I.E.L.D., S.T.R.I.K.E., S.W.O.R.D., A.R.M.O.R., A.I.M., Alpha Flight, H.A.M.M.E.R., HYDRA and even aspects of Damage Control, this organization truly believes itself as the only hope humanity has to keep mutants from ascending to control of the Earth within the next few generations. That belief has allowed Orchis to salvage the remains of Sol&#39;s Hammer and retrofit it into the Orchis Forge, a site for the creation of a Mother Mold. A strike force of X-Men led by Cyclops successfully destroyed the Mother Mold, which was believed to be the site of the creation of Nimrod, with heavy casualties on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;House of X&#39;&#39; #4&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Alternative versions of S.H.I.E.L.D.==\n\n===Amalgam Comics===\n{{main|Amalgam Comics}}\n&#39;&#39;&#39;S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;&#39;&#39; (&#39;&#39;&#39;Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate&#39;&#39;&#39;) is the [[Amalgam Comics]] equivalent of S.H.I.E.L.D. from [[Marvel Comics]].

Rock]] after [[World War II]] in order to tackle the danger posed by [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)#Amalgam Comics|Hydra]].

During the Gulf War, the Weapon X Project, headed by [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|Colonel John Wraith]], was sanctioned by S.H.I.E.L.D. and resulted in the creation of [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]].\n\nAfter Ross stepped down and retired, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] was then selected as the organization&#39;s [[executive director]]. His first actions were to shut down Weapon X and resurrect the [[supersoldier|Super Soldier]] program, commissioning Richard Parker, Dr. Bruce Banner, Franklin Storm, and young intern Hank Pym to try to recreate the formula that made [[Alternative versions of Captain America#Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]]. This failed and resulted in the creation of the Hulk when Banner injected his serum into himself. It was later revealed that the chemical called Oz, which turned Norman Osborn into the [[Green Goblin#Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]], was also created in hopes of recreating the Super Soldier formula. [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] was also a product of the Oz formula. Also, the creation of the supervillains [[Ultimate Sandman|Sandman]] and [[Ultimate Electro|Electro]] are due to [[Justin Hammer|Hammer Industries]] attempting to recreate the Super Soldier formula for S.H.I.E.L.D. Then S.H.I.E.L.D. created its own superhero team, the [[Ultimates]]. Later still, it brought the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] and [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] under S.H.I.E.L.D. jurisdiction. In &#39;&#39;Ultimate X-Men&#39;&#39; #65 (Jan. 2006), S.H.I.E.L.D. severed ties with the X-Men. After the events of &#39;&#39;[[Ultimate Power]]&#39;&#39;, S.H.I.E.L.D. is under the directorship of [[Carol Danvers#Ultimate Carol Danvers|Carol Danvers]], as Nick Fury was temporarily stranded in the [[Supreme Power]] Universe. After \&quot;Ultimatum\&quot;, Nick Fury becomes head of the Black-Ops division in &#39;&#39;[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers#The Next Generation|Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]&#39;&#39;. It is also revealed he is plotting to take back his position as director.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Avengers&#39;&#39; #6&lt;/ref&gt; After a mysterious force frames Danvers for selling super-soldiers to rival nations, it was revealed to be a ploy by [[Gregory Stark]] to become Director, until Fury, the Avengers, and Ultimates stop him, resulting in Thor electrocuting Dr. Stark to death.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Comics: Ultimate Avengers vs New Ultimates&#39;&#39; #5-6&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Death of Spider-Man]], [[Mentallo|Marvin Flumm]] was promoted to Director by the [[U.S. President]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Comics: Ultimates&#39;&#39; #6&lt;/ref&gt; After an arc called \&quot;Divided We Stand\&quot;, a crossover involving &#39;&#39;[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Ultimate Comics: X-Men]]&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;[[Ultimate Comics: Ultimates]]&#39;&#39;, [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Monica Chang]] (one of Nick Fury&#39;s ex-wives and 2nd [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]) was promoted by Captain America to Director after Agent Flumm was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Comics: Ultimates&#39;&#39; #21&lt;/ref&gt; S.H.I.E.L.D. is later disassembled after the events of Cataclysm, for although the Ultimates were able to defeat [[Galactus]], the destruction caused by Galactus&#39;s attack and the loss of Captain America and Thor make it the last straw for the United States Government, who immediately decide to shut S.H.I.E.L.D. down, resulting in villains such as [[Norman Osborn]] (Green Goblin) and [[Doctor Doom|Victor Van Damme]] (Doctor Doom), who are revealed to be alive, being released into the custody of other federal agencies.{{issue|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. is controlled entirely by the United States, but maintains ties with the European Defense Initiative and the British-operated S.T.R.I.K.E.\n\n;Members\n{{Main|List of S.H.I.E.L.D. members#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.}}\n\n;Divisions\n* Psi\n* Black-Ops\n* Eye\n* Combat-Unit\n\n===S.A.F.E.===\n&#39;&#39;&#39;S.A.F.E.&#39;&#39;&#39; (&#39;&#39;&#39;S&#39;&#39;&#39;trategic &#39;&#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39;&#39;ction &#39;&#39;&#39;F&#39;&#39;&#39;or &#39;&#39;&#39;E&#39;&#39;&#39;mergencies)\u2014introduced in Marvel&#39;s line of novels in the mid-1990s\u2014is the United States&#39; answer to S.H.I.E.L.D.

Occasionally, these translations will show S.H.I.E.L.D. with an altered name.\n\nIn the case of selected French editions, the name of the agency was depicted as S.E.R.V.O., which sounds like \&quot;brain\&quot; (&#39;&#39;cerveau&#39;&#39;) in French.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In later editions, S.H.I.E.L.D is maintained, with the acronym translated as Strat\u00e9gie, Habilit\u00e9, Intervention, Ex\u00e9cution et Logistique D\u00e9fensive (Strategy, Empowered, Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Defensive).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn Finnish the name that applies to S.H.I.E.L.D. in mainstream Marvel continuity is Y.P.K.V.V. (Ylimm\u00e4isen P\u00e4\u00e4majan Kansainv\u00e4lisen Vakoilun Vastustamisjaos), a direct translation of the original English.

(pronounced ASPIDA, meaning \&quot;shield\&quot; in Greek). The initials stand for Supreme Military and Political Foundation of International Counter-espionage (\u0391\u03bd\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf \u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u038a\u03b4\u03c1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1 \u0394\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn Portuguese, the name S.H.I.E.L.D. remains, but it is translated as \&quot;&#39;&#39;&#39;S&#39;&#39;&#39;uperintend\u00eancia &#39;&#39;&#39;H&#39;&#39;&#39;umana de &#39;&#39;&#39;I&#39;&#39;&#39;nterven\u00e7\u00e3o, &#39;&#39;&#39;E&#39;&#39;&#39;spionagem, &#39;&#39;&#39;L&#39;&#39;&#39;og\u00edstica e &#39;&#39;&#39;D&#39;&#39;&#39;issuas\u00e3o\&quot;, i. e., Human Superintendence for Intervention, Espionage, Logistics and Dissuasion.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn Dutch the name S.C.H.I.L.D.

Later publisher Planeta DeAgostini used the name S.H.I.E.L.D., but translating the acronym as \&quot;Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional para la Ejecuci\u00f3n y el Cumplimiento de la Ley\&quot; (international organisation for implementation and fulfillment of law). It has been suggested, as a joke, that the acronym does not correspond to the meaning because the acronym itself is undercover. Now, Panini translates the acronym as \&quot;Servicio Homologado de Inteligencia, Espionaje, Log\u00edstica y Defensa\&quot; (Accredited Service of Intelligence, Espionage, Logistics, and Defense) to keep the original acronym; being this the name used in the current movies or series.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn Danish, S.H.I.E.L.D. was originally known as S.K.J.O.L.D., \&quot;Skjold\&quot; being the Danish word for a shield, though the meaning of the abbreviation would differ.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn Russian, S.H.I.E.L.D. is named \u0429.\u0418.\u0422.
