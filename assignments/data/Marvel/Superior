They debuted in the 2010 \"[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]\" storyline, in the series ''[[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]]''. Their name is a play that they are said to be the [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard children]] of evil supervillains.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Bastards of Evil first appeared in ''[[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]]'' Vol. 2 #1 and were created by [[Sean McKeever]] and David Baldeon.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=44}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional team history==\nThe Bastards of Evil are young supervillains who claim to be the disavowed children of some of the supervillains. They came together not only to rob a bank but to come up with plans to take over the world. The Bastards of Evil committed acts of terrorism and recorded it with floating robotic cameras. Warhead destroyed a part of [[Ohio]] which [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] stopped, but Warhead escaped. The Bastards of Evil end up running afoul of the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]]. During the fight, Warhead exploded on Ground Zero (the former site of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]) presumably killing himself and thousands of bystanders.<ref>''Young Allies'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Bastards of Evil meet up with their mysterious benefactor. When [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] and [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] fight [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], he ends up defeating them. He let them live so that they can spread the message that he doesn't endorse Aftershock and the Bastards of Evil's terrorism. He also says that they should look up how and when he got his powers on the internet and there no way a girl of Aftershock's age could have been conceived after he got his powers. It's impossible for him to be Aftershock's father.<ref>''Young Allies'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAftershock informs the Bastards of Evil that they have orders from their superior to [[Anya Corazon|Ara\u00f1a]] and [[Rikki Barnes|Nomad]]. When Firestar and Gravity arrive at the edge where Warhead exploded, they are ambushed by the Bastards of Evil.<ref>''Young Allies'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the Young Allies' fight with the Bastards of Evil, the Young Allies end up meeting their leader who calls himself Superior and claims to be the son of the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]].<ref>''Young Allies'' Vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIt is soon revealed during the battle that the other Bastards of Evil members were originally teenagers who were kidnapped by Superior, exposed to various forms of radiation, given personal narrative implants, and false memories of their forgotten childhood as the children of those supervillains. When Ara\u00f1a and Nomad are kidnapped, the Bastards of Evil plot to kill them on national television. When the Young Allies arrived and convinced the Bastards of Evil members to in-fight themselves, Aftershock remembers her true identity of Danielle Blunt and causes her to attack Singularity who remembers his true identity of Devin Touhy. Singularity turns on Superior while the other Bastards of Evil members question their true identities. This gave the Young Allies the opportunity to defeat them after Superior uses his telekinetic abilities to rip Singularity in half. Superior and the remaining Bastards of Evil were incarcerated at the Raft. While in his cell, Superior plans to find a way to escape incarceration, wipe the memories of the remaining Bastards of Evil, and create \"new siblings\" to serve him.<ref>''Young Allies'' Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\" storyline, Aftershock and Ember were seen escaping from the Raft after [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone leveled it.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #158.
