Animation]].\n\nThe film had its broadcast premiere on October 18, 2008 on [[Cartoon Network]].\n\n==Plot==\nAn unknown entity has decided to eradicate mankind due to its capacity of violence.\n\nAt the end of the [[Korean War]], [[United States Air Force]] pilot [[Hal Jordan]] and his wingman, [[Challengers of the Unknown|Kyle \&quot;Ace\&quot; Morgan]], are attacked by enemy pilots but survive. In Gotham, [[Martian Manhunter|J&#39;onn J&#39;onzz]] - the last survivor of the Green Martian race - is teleported to Earth; unable to return, J&#39;onn disguises himself. In Las Vegas, [[Iris West]] is on the telephone with her fianc\u00e9 [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] - also known as the Flash - at a casino when [[Captain Cold]] arrives to commit robbery; he races from Central City to confront Cold. Flash finds the five bombs hidden by Cold and captures him, before Cold is possessed by an entity.\n\nAfter two years, J&#39;onn (as John Jones) is a detective with the Gotham City Police Department. A [[doomsday cult]] that worships the \&quot;[[Dinosaur Island#DC: The New Frontier|Centre]]\&quot; has kidnapped a child for a sacrificial ritual; J&#39;onn and his partner [[Slam Bradley]] join [[Batman]] in battling the cult, but a fire renders J&#39;onn powerless. The cult leader is possessed by the entity, who identifies itself as the \&quot;Centre\&quot;, and warns of impending judgement. Hal trains under Col. [[Rick Flag]] at Ferris Aircraft for a U.S. government project, as explained by [[Carol Ferris]], to build a spacecraft for travel to Mars. Special agent [[King Faraday]] oversees the project.\n\nBatman suggests to J&#39;onn that they work together in investigating the Centre-worshiping cult. The Flash defeats a robotic duplicate of [[Gorilla Grodd]]; after being targeted by the government, he announces his retirement. J&#39;onn interrogates former Ferris employee Harry Leiter, apprehended for murder while under The Centre&#39;s influence, who tells them about the launch to Mars and when Faraday arrives, J&#39;onn briefly glimpses into his mind to learn the truth. Seeing the contemptuous response to the Flash&#39;s announcement, J&#39;onn gives his research to Batman and plans to hide on the rocket. J&#39;onn and Faraday fight on the launchpad; the rocket is damaged and malfunctions after leaving Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Hal wants to attempt a landing but Flag reveals weapons of mass destruction are on board, intended to destroy any life on Mars. Hal is ejected from the cockpit and saved by [[Superman]]; Flag detonates the rocket as J&#39;onn is held prisoner.\n\nOn [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]], [[Wonder Woman]] trains with [[Mala (Amazon)|Mala]] before being attacked by The Centre. After crash-landing on Earth as a result of Flag&#39;s rocket explosion, a fatally wounded [[Abin Sur]] gives his ring to Hal and tells him of The Centre, which is described as a monstrous creature that seeks the destruction of humans; Sur dies shortly after, despite Jordan&#39;s efforts to save him. Superman and Batman review J&#39;onn&#39;s research as [[Lois Lane]] reports that a giant [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]] is attacking Cape Canaveral. Wonder Woman&#39;s invisible jet crashes and she warns that The Centre is coming. J&#39;onn decides to help save Earth after his hope for humanity is renewed. The Centre, a massive flying island with an army of mutant dinosaurs to guard it, begins its attack on America, the Flash, [[Green Arrow]], [[Adam Strange]], the [[Challengers of the Unknown]], and the [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawks]] work with the soldiers on the base; Superman reconnoiters the Centre but is defeated. Moved by his efforts, the heroes plan to use [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]&#39;s reduction ray to destabilize the island along with a frontal assault and while Hal and Ace fly a bombing mission into the creature, leaving Flash to crisscross the island with the ray.\n\nThe aerial assault is nearly outmatched and a herd of dinosaurs ambush Faraday&#39;s ground forces, the Centre&#39;s psychic force briefly overwhelms J&#39;onn. Faraday is captured by a dinosaur and both perish after Faraday sets off hand grenades. Hal and Ace shoot their way into The Centre&#39;s core but a hallucinogenic attack disorients them; a thick red fluid jams their weapons and almost suffocates them. Hal&#39;s ring relays instructions from the [[Guardians of the Universe]] on its use. Ace detonates his payload before Hal rescues him. The Flash races across the ocean, leaps onto The Centre&#39;s surface and covers it on foot, the Centre begins to shrink; Hal envelops the island in green energy, towing it into space where it explodes. As the team celebrates their victory a glowing light emerges from the water and [[Aquaman]] emerges from a submarine carrying Superman.\n\nThe world celebrates the Centre&#39;s defeat with a ceremony. The film ends with a montage of various heroes and villains, including the birth of the [[Justice League]] set to the [[New Frontier|titular John F. Kennedy speech]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[David Boreanaz]] as [[Hal Jordan|Hal Jordan / Green Lantern]]\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as [[Martian Manhunter|J&#39;onn J&#39;onzz / John Jones / Martian Manhunter]]\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen / The Flash]]\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as [[Ace Morgan]]\n* [[Lucy Lawless]] as [[Wonder Woman|Diana Prince / Wonder Woman]]\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as [[Superman|Kal-El / Clark Kent / Superman]]\n* [[Lex Lang]] as [[Rick Flag]]\n* [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]] as [[King Faraday]]\n* [[Kyra Sedgwick]] as [[Lois Lane]]\n* [[Brooke Shields]] as [[Carol Ferris]]\n* [[Joe Alaskey]] as [[Bugs Bunny]] (cameo)\n* [[Jeff Bennett]] as Sportscaster\n* [[Corey Burton]] as [[Abin Sur]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] &#39;&#39;(uncredited)&#39;&#39;\n* [[Townsend Coleman]] as [[Will Magnus|Dr. Magnus]]\n* [[Keith David]] as [[Dinosaur Island|The Centre]]\n* Sean Donnellan as Haley\n* [[Robin Atkin Downes]] as [[Guardians of the Universe|The Guardian]]\n* [[Shane Haboucha]] as [[Dick Grayson|Dick Grayson / Robin]]\n* [[David Hunt (actor)|David Hunt]] as Harry\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as [[Iris West]]\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Crooner\n* [[Vanessa Marshall]] as [[Mala (Amazon)|Amazon Woman]]\n* [[Jim Meskimen]] as [[Slam Bradley]]\n* [[James Arnold Taylor]] as [[Captain Cold]]\n* [[John F.
