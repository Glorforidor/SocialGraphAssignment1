Experimenting on himself, he succeeded in making himself stronger and taller, but as a side-effect of the process he also became almost mindlessly aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mentally debilitated Desmond was cared for by his brother Roland, a local criminal, who kept their mother from discovering what Mark had done to himself.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency1\&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | contribution=Blockbuster I | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=56 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[London]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRoland manipulated his brother into committing crimes on his behalf until they came into conflict with [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]. Bruce Wayne had once rescued a young Desmond from drowning, and he discovered that he could calm the enraged adult Desmond by removing his cowl and showing his face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |last2=Kronenberg |first2=Michael |title=The Batcave Companion |date=2009 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1893905788 |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desmond later found himself clashing with Batman on various occasions. He joined the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] briefly for a battle with the [[Justice League]]. Later, [[Amanda Waller]] recruited Desmond for her revived [[Suicide Squad]]. He was killed fighting [[Darkseid]]&#39;s creation, [[Brimstone (DC Comics)|Brimstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[John Ostrander|Ostrander, John]] | Penciller = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Inker = [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]] | Story = Send For... the Suicide Squad! | Title = [[Legends (comics)|Legends]] | Volume = | Issue = #3 | Date = January 1987 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = 14 | Panel = | ID = }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn Pre-Crisis, Blockbuster absorbed energies from the Alfred Memorial which gave him some powers and was once substituted for the super-strong [[undead]] villain [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] from Earth-2 due to a machine that was substituting people from both Earths. Green Lantern caused him to fight Solomon Grundy, leading to them both briefly getting the fight knocked out of each other.\n\nIn September 2011, &#39;&#39;[[The New 52]]&#39;&#39; rebooted DC&#39;s continuity. In this new timeline, Mark Desmond is a patient of Dr. Phayne&#39;s. He lives on the estate and at night he undergoes procedures to enhance his intelligence. He is exposed to small amounts of a green compound intravenously. An accident is caused by a new patient believing he is in pain and the cascade of green liquid overdoses Desmond and creates an explosion. The overdose exposes a super-strong man calling himself Blockbuster. He rampages from the building in pain and knocks an attacking Hawkman unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Savage Hawkman&#39;&#39; #18&lt;/ref&gt; Blockbuster was later mind-controlled by Necromancer to help her steal an artifact from a Washington D.C. museum, which brought the attention of [[Hawk and Dove]]. They teamed up with Batman and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] to stop Blockbuster and Necromancer.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Hawk and Dove&#39;&#39; (vol. 5) #6&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Desmond later appears as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains upon having been recruited by [[Outsider (comics)|Outsider]]. When [[Catwoman]] breaks out of Arkham Asylum, Mark Desmond and [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] confronted Catwoman on a rooftop, which ended with Catwoman being knocked out.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League of America&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #3&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Roland Desmond===\n{{Infobox comics character &lt;!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--&gt;\n|character_name=Blockbuster\n|image=Blockbuster (Roland Desmond).jpg\n|converted=y\n|caption={{Descript-inner-art|Underworld Unleashed: Patterns of Fear |1|#1|November 1995 |art = [[Rick Burchett]]|pub=DC}}\n|alter_ego=Roland Desmond\n|publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n|debut=&#39;&#39;[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]&#39;&#39; #9 (April [[1989 in comics|1989]])\n|creators=[[Roger Stern]]&lt;br/&gt;[[Tom Lyle]]\n|alliances=[[Secret Society of Super Villains|Underground Society]]&lt;br/&gt;[[Black Lantern Corps]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=Superhuman strength, stamina, and endurance&lt;br&gt;High-level resistance to injury&lt;br&gt;[[Genius]]-level intellect\n|}}\n&#39;&#39;&#39;Roland Desmond&#39;&#39;&#39; became the second Blockbuster after a severe illness forced him to be treated with experimental steroids. Like his brother Mark, Roland became a child-minded super-strong monster. He ran wild in the Southwest, but [[Batman]] and [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] (Will Payton) brought his rampage to an end.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Starman&#39;&#39; #10 (May 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency2\&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Blockbuster II | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=55 | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | location=London | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDesmond became obsessed with elevating himself greatly above his debilitated intellect. A pact with the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] granted him a genius-level intellect and Desmond embarked once more on a career of crime and destruction. He began his revived criminal career by causing chaos in the town of Manchester, although his schemes were foiled by the speedster, [[Bart Allen|Impulse]].\n\nDesmond then moved to his mother&#39;s home town of [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]]. He forced the crime lord Angel Marin out of power and took over the city&#39;s criminal rackets. Roland&#39;s plan was to build a criminal empire in the &#39;Haven, that would eventually enable him to extend his dominion over [[Gotham City|Gotham]], [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and [[New York City|New York]]&#39;s underworlds. For that purpose, he bought the corrupt elements of the city&#39;s police department, most notably Police Chief Redhorn and Inspector [[Torque (DC Comics)|Dudley \&quot;Deadly\&quot; Soames]].\n\nDespite his swift and vicious consolidation of power, Blockbuster&#39;s hold on Bl\u00fcdhaven&#39;s organized crime was nevertheless weakened by the intervention of the city&#39;s new protector, [[Nightwing]] ([[Dick Grayson]], the former [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]), who, with [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]&#39;s help, foiled Desmond&#39;s plans at every turn. Oracle often removes money from Blockbuster&#39;s accounts and he has a man working to stop and find Oracle, named Vogel.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Nightwing&#39;&#39; #44 (June 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDesmond&#39;s primary goal became the elimination of the young vigilante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; He placed a contract on Nightwing&#39;s life, employing the services of several assassins, including [[Lady Vic]], Stallion, Brutale, the [[Trigger Twins]], and [[Shrike (comics)#Boone|Shrike]].\n\nAs a further result of his initial transformation, Desmond later developed [[albinism]] and a heart defect. He was restored to (comparative) health by a heart transplant from one of the talking apes of [[Gorilla City]], and was consolidating his control over Bl\u00fcdhaven and contemplating a takeover of [[Gotham City]], when he was killed by the new [[Tarantula (DC Comics)#Catalina Flores|Tarantula]], Catalina Flores.&lt;ref&gt;[[DCDatabase:Nightwing Vol 2 93|&#39;&#39;Nightwing&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #93]] (July 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs part of the &#39;&#39;[[Blackest Night]]&#39;&#39; event, Roland&#39;s corpse is reanimated by a [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power ring]] and recruited to the [[Black Lantern Corps]] in &#39;&#39;Blackest Night: Batman&#39;&#39; #1 (October 2009).\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[DC Rebirth]]&#39;&#39; reboot, Blockbuster appears, asking Nightwing to help with a job.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Nightwing&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #22&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Blockbuster III===\n[[Lex Luthor]] created a new Blockbuster in the pages of the miniseries event, &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39;, to serve as an opponent of his manufactured hero team, [[Infinity, Inc.]]\n\nLittle is revealed about this Blockbuster, save for the fact that Luthor possesses some measure of control over his actions and level of strength. Luthor also comments that he is stronger than either of the previous two Blockbusters. This brute&#39;s cognitive abilities and appearance are very similar to the original. Blockbuster, with controlled interference from Lex Luthor, kills the superhero [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Trajectory|Trajectory]].\n\n===Martian Manhunter&#39;s disguise===\nA Blockbuster appears among the villains exiled to an alien world in &#39;&#39;[[Salvation Run]]&#39;&#39;. In issue #3, it is revealed to be a disguised [[Martian Manhunter]].\n\n===Female Blockbuster===\nA newer, female Blockbuster appears in the swamps of Louisiana and fights [[Mon-El]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #689 (August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The Blockbuster&#39;s Gang===\nThe Blockbuster&#39;s Gang first appears in &#39;&#39;[[Nightwing]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #2. The Blockbuster&#39;s Gang was one of the most powerful mobs in [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], made up of corrupt police officers and supervillains. Organization Leader: Roland Desmond. Current Members: Thrilldevil, Giz, Mouse and Mateo Flores. Former Members: [[Brutale (DC Comics)|Brutale]], [[Electrocutioner]] II, [[Torque (DC Comics)|Torque]], [[Lady Vic]], [[Shrike (comics)|Shrike]], Stallion, [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]], the [[Trigger Twins]] and Cicso Blane.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAll Blockbusters have superhuman strength, stamina, and endurance. They also have a high degree of resistance to physical and energy attacks. In a straight fight, typically their greatest weakness is their comparatively slower speed, making it relatively easy to evade opposing attacks, although this is of limited use if confronting Blockbuster inside buildings.\n\nAfter selling his soul to Neron, Roland Desmond gained genius-level intelligence.\n\n==Alternative versions==\n===&#39;&#39;Batman/Aliens&#39;&#39;===\nThe Roland Desmond version of Blockbuster is mentioned as using a construction company as a [[Trojan horse]]. However, the owner and multiple workers are killed by an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] they unearth from a bioweapons lab at a construction site.\n\n===DC Animated Universe comics===\nThe Roland Desmond version of Blockbuster appears in [[Adventures in the DC Universe]] #1 and DC Comics Presents: Wonder Woman Adventures #1.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Batman: Arkham&#39;&#39;===\nIn &#39;&#39;Batman: Arkham Knight-Genesis&#39;&#39;, a prequel comic to &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]&#39;&#39;, the Mark Desmond version of Blockbuster and [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] brutally beat [[Jason Todd]], the second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], while dressed in Batman costumes as part of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]&#39;s brainwashing of Todd. Todd fought back, but was reluctant to kill them. [[Harley Quinn]] encouraged him, shooting Blockbuster in the chest to prove her point.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Just Imagine...&#39;&#39;===\nIn [[Stan Lee]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Just Imagine...]]&#39;&#39; series, Blockbuster is reimagined as &#39;&#39;&#39;Brock Smith&#39;&#39;&#39;, a death row inmate notorious for a series of mass murders committed with his bare hands, who is rescued by the series&#39; mysterious villain Dominic Darrk and re-empowered with extra super-strength (and a purple carapace) as part of a villainous [[Doom Patrol]]. He is defeated and de-powered by Batman and Wonder Woman (who crack his purple facade with Wonder Woman&#39;s staff), and dies after running over a live electrical cable.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* The Mark Desmond version of Blockbuster is first seen in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. In the episode \&quot;Kid Stuff\&quot;, he, [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]] and [[KGBeast]] were fighting [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] at Fort Knox&#39;s gold vault and were defeated before [[Mordred]] used an ancient amulet to transport all of the adults in the world to another dimension; Blockbuster being among the ones teleported to the other dimension. In the episode \&quot;I Am Legion\&quot;, Blockbuster is also shown as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. In the episode \&quot;Alive\&quot;, Blockbuster sides against [[Lex Luthor]] during the mutiny in favor of [[Gorilla Grodd]]. He is frozen by [[Killer Frost]] and blown up by [[Darkseid]] along with the other mutineers.\n* Mark Desmond appears in &#39;&#39;[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]&#39;&#39; animated series, voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. Unlike in the comics, he is African-American. In the episode \&quot;Meltdown\&quot;, Desmond is a scientist working for [[Wayne Enterprises]] who is in charge of [[Clayface|Ethan Bennett]]&#39;s parole agreement of not using shapeshifting powers.\n* The Mark Desmond version of Blockbuster appears in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39;, with Mark Desmond voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]] and Blockbuster voiced again by Kevin Michael Richardson. In the teaser of \&quot;Death Race to Oblivion!\&quot;, Batman has been keeping an eye on since he stole some chemicals from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and confronts evil child genius Desmond at a museum with a plot to steal a diamond called the Star of Bialya. The crowd objects to Batman grabbing Desmond until the boy drinks the serum that transforms him into Blockbuster. As Blockbuster, he subdues Batman. When Billy Batson steps forth, Blockbuster grabs and asks Billy if there are any last words. Billy shouts \&quot;Shazam!\&quot; and transforms into [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] who manages to defeat Blockbuster. In the episode \&quot;Night of the Batmen\&quot;, Blockbuster assists Bane, Killer Croc, and Solomon Grundy in stealing a statue, only to be thwarted by Captain Marvel dressed as Batman.\n\n[[Image:Blockbusteranimated.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Blockbuster as seen in &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]&#39;&#39;.]]\n* The Mark Desmond version of Blockbuster first appears in the &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]&#39;&#39; animated series, with Mark Desmond voiced by [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] while sound effects were used for Blockbuster&#39;s vocal effects. This version of Blockbuster is very different in appearance from any of his comic book incarnations, having purposefully been redesigned as it was felt the original version was too similar to the [[Hulk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://phillybee.deviantart.com/art/Blockbuster-Turn-188081365?q=boost%3Apopular+Blockbuster&amp;qo=5 | title=Blockbuster Turn by *Phillybee | work=Deviant Art | accessdate=December 29, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709015901/http://phillybee.deviantart.com/art/Blockbuster-Turn-188081365?q=boost:popular+Blockbuster&amp;qo=5 | archive-date=July 9, 2011 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; His transformation in the series involves his Blockbuster form ripping through his human skin. In the episode \&quot;Independence Day\&quot;, Mark Desmond is shown as a senior member of [[Project Cadmus]] who takes his orders directly from [[Secret Society of Super Villains|the Light]] (Project Cadmus&#39; [[Board of directors|Board of Directors]]) and uses the Blockbuster serum in order to combat [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Aqualad (Kaldur&#39;ahm)|Aqualad]] and [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]. The serum to take this form seems to have decreased his intelligence, as Aqualad comments, \&quot;I doubt he is planning anything anymore\&quot;. He is defeated by the four by the time the Justice League arrive and is taken away by some of the Justice League members. In the episode \&quot;Terrors\&quot;, Blockbuster is seen as an inmate at Belle Reve and is acting as muscle for [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle Sr.]] alongside Mammoth. He and Mammoth are defeated by Superboy. In the episode \&quot;Usual Suspects\&quot;, Blockbuster joins [[Lex Luthor]], Queen Bee, Sportsmaster and Bane in meeting with Superboy, Miss Martian and Artemis. During the fight between the young heroes and the assembled villains, Lex mentions that Dr. Desmond wasn&#39;t able to add the other programs to control Superboy, blaming Dr. Desmond. Superboy manages to defeat Blockbuster.\n* While Blockbuster himself has not appeared in the [[Arrowverse]] series, the &#39;&#39;[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]&#39;&#39; [[Arrow (season 7)|seventh season]] episode \&quot;Star City Slayer\&quot; does make a reference to him, with Captain Singh- head of the Central City police department- mentioning that Blockbuster once attempted to expand from Bludhaven into Central City by triggering a gang war before Dinah Drake- a former undercover cop and the current Black Canary/ head of Star City police department- stopped him during an old assignment, Singh using this as an example of Dinah&#39;s personal strength to demonstrate how he has faith she would overcome the recent exposure of her secret identity.\n\n===Film===\n* Blockbuster was reportedly featured in [[David S.
