Neith and Nun sired [[Atum (comics)|Atum]], the first of the Ogdoad \u2014 the old gods. As Neith went about creating mortal life, Set desired to destroy her creations. In turn, Neith called Atum for protection. Atum and Set fought for eons until Atum transformed into the Demogorge and drove Set off. After Set's defeat, Atum begot the Ennaed \u2014 the new gods, took the name Ra and settled in the sun.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia_Mythologica\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]], [[Greg Pak]], [[Fred Van Lente]] & [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller =  Kevin Sharpe | Inker = Kevin Sharpe | Story =  | Title = Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica| Issue = 1 | Date = July 2009| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>\n\nThe Ennead resided in the ancient city of [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] until their king [[Osiris (Marvel Comics)|Osiris]] placed mortal [[pharaoh]]s in charge so that the gods could become less involved with human affairs and relocated themselves to the extradimensional realm of Celestial Heliopolis.
