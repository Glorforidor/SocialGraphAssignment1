The character is depicted as a 14-year-old high school student who was adopted by [[Aunt May#Spider-Verse|Aunt May]] and [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Uncle Ben]] following the death of her father/caretaker. She pilots a psychically-powered mech suit built by her father known as the '''SP//dr''', which is partially controlled by a radioactive spider that also shares a psychic link with  Peni.<ref name=\"eosv5\">''Edge of Spider-Verse'' #5 (2014)</ref>\n\nThe character was featured in ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', with her voice provided by actress [[Kimiko Glenn]].\n\n==Publication history==\nPeni Parker and SP//dr were created by writer [[Gerard Way]] and artist Jake Wyatt, and first appeared in the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' comic book ''Edge of Spider-Verse'' #5 in October 2014. According to Way, SP//dr \"is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} three vital components: a pilot, a machine, and a radioactive sentient spider acting as one half of the brain that makes it all work.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Gerard Way Makes his Marvel Debut with Edge of Spider-Verse #5 {{!}} News {{!}} Marvel |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/gerard-way-makes-his-marvel-debut-with-edge-of-spider-verse-5 |website=Marvel Entertainment |accessdate=18 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gerard Way Discusses His Marvel Debut with \"Edge of Spider-Verse\" |url=https://www.cbr.com/gerard-way-discusses-his-marvel-debut-with-edge-of-spider-verse/ |website=CBR |accessdate=18 January 2019 |date=26 June 2014}}</ref> SP//dr\u2019s story was continued in the ''[[Spider-Geddon]]'' comic book, ''Edge of Spider-Geddon'' #2 by Alberto Albuquerque.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jake Wyatt Departs Sp//dr-Focused Edge of Spider-Geddon #2 |url=https://www.cbr.com/jake-wyatt-exits-edge-of-spider-geddon/ |website=CBR |accessdate=18 January 2019 |date=2 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nPeni's father acted as the original pilot of SP//dr, in which he protected New York from crime and other dangers. After his mysterious death, Peni is approached by her [[Aunt May#Spider-Verse|aunt]] and [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|uncle]] to be the new pilot of the SP//dr. In order to do so however, she would need to be bitten by the sentient radioactive spider which controlled part of the suit. Soon after being bitten, Peni becomes the new protector of the city and is shown five years later battling her universe\u2019s version of [[Mysterio#Spider-Verse|Mysterio]] - revealed to be an obsessed fanboy who asks her if she ever got his \u201cmix-disc\u201d. Peni eventually teams up with Daredevil \u2013 who had known her father \u2013 to battle some criminals. Then, while taking a subway to go home after a long day\u2019s night, she's approached by [[Spider-Ham]] and [[Alternative_versions_of_Spider-Man#Old_Man_Spider|Old Man Spider]] to join the Spider-Army to fight the [[Inheritors (comics)|Inheritors]].\n\nAfter the events of [[Spider-Verse]], Peni is approached in school by a girl named Addy Brock. She asks her if she was really the SP//dr pilot, but Peni ignores her; which prompts Addy to state that Peni is not as special as she thinks. Peni then tries to talk to Ben and May about being special, but she gets ignored. While improving the SP//dr's Web Shooters, she notices Addy walking in the base and follows her; only to find another mech-suit similar to the SP//dr, only in black and powered by a sym-engine called [[Alternative versions of Venom#Spider-Geddon|VEN#m]], with Addy as its pilot. She becomes furious at her aunt and uncle for not telling her about the new suit. When a kaiju-like creature named [[Morbius the Living Vampire#Spider-Geddon|M.O.R.B.I.U.S.]] starts to drain the city's electrical energy, SP//dr goes after it, but is quickly defeated. In order to defeat M.O.R.B.I.U.S., Peni's aunt and uncle send VEN#m to defeat the creature. It is successful in stopping the monster, but the creature causes VEN#m to malfunction; causing the mech suit to acquire a mind of its own. The black suit starts to consume Addy, and when May goes to fix the problem manually, it starts to consume her as well. SP//dr confronts VEN#m, but the black mech suit proves to be more powerful and it nearly destroys SP//dr. Afterwards, Peni, remembering her improved Web Shooters, defeats VEN#m. Unfortunately, she's too late to save her Aunt May and Addy, who have vanished from the inside of the suit. Later, Peni and Ben have a heart to heart, but Spider-Ham re-appears to recruit Peni to help defeat the Inheritors once more after they returned during the events of ''[[Spider-Geddon]]''.\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\nPeni Parker and SP//dr appear in the computer-animated superhero film ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', with [[Kimiko Glenn]] voicing the former.<ref name=\"MulaneyGlenn\">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/spider-man-into-spider-verse-spider-man-noir-spider-ham-peni-parker/|title=Into the Spider-Verse: Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham & Peni Parker Confirmed|website=Screen Rant|last=Freeman|first=Molly|date=July 20, 2018|accessdate=July 20, 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/714A3oKDH?url=https://screenrant.com/spider-man-into-spider-verse-spider-man-noir-spider-ham-peni-parker/|archivedate=21 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"PeniParkerDescription\">{{cite news |last1=Peters |first1=Megan |title=\u2018Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u2019 Debuts Its Anime Heroine |url=https://comicbook.com/anime/2018/10/02/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-anime-peni-parker/ |accessdate=October 2, 2018 |work=Comicbook.com |date=October 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002185739/https://comicbook.com/anime/2018/10/02/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-anime-peni-parker/ |archive-date=2 October 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> They arrive in [[Miles Morales]]' universe along with [[Spider-Ham]] and [[Spider-Man Noir]] due to the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s machinations and join forces with Miles and other Spider-People to return to their respective home dimensions.
