== Synopsis ==
Jonathan Romero, aka "Dead Romeo," was the lead singer of the '80s rock band The Dead Romeos. The story follows John Romero, a glam rock musician who died in the 1980s, but not before falling madly in love, marrying his sweetheart and becoming a vampire. Romero returns from Hell in the present day with a chance to escape forever. All he has to do is kill one innocent virgin. But can the hopeless romantic rock singer do such a terrible thing? And if he can’t, what will his Hellish companions, the evil Hollywood Vampires, do to John if he chokes? . Now he's back on Earth and he has a difficult choice to make: Kill his true love and earn his permanent release from eternal damnation – or protect her and burn for eternity. Either way, someone will have to die.
