Art by [[Oscar Jimenez (comics)|Oscar Jimenez]].]]\n\nA &#39;&#39;&#39;speedster&#39;&#39;&#39; is a character whose powers primarily relate to &#39;&#39;&#39;superhuman speed&#39;&#39;&#39;&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also known as &#39;&#39;&#39;superspeed&#39;&#39;&#39;&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA; &#39;Superspeed (fiction)&#39; redirects here--&gt;). Primary abilities shared by all speedsters include running at speeds far in excess of human capability (to varying degrees) and resistance to the side effects (air resistance, inability to breathe, dynamic shock resulting from contact with objects at high speed, etc.) that result from such velocity. In almost all cases, speedsters are able to physically attack opponents by striking them while at high speed to impart huge amounts of kinetic energy without suffering harm. A variety of other powers have been attributed to speedsters depending on the story, the origin of the power, and the established continuity and rules of a given universe.\n\n==Plausibility and artistic license==\nThe use of speedsters in fiction requires [[artistic license]] due to the laws of [[physics]] that would prohibit such abilities.  Moving at the speed of sound, for example, would create [[sonic boom]]s that are usually not heard in such stories and generate substantial heat.  An enormous amount of energy would be required to achieve such speeds, and as some speedsters can actually move close to or at the [[speed of light]], this would cause them to gain near-infinite mass, according to the laws of [[theory of relativity|relativity]].\n\nThe &#39;&#39;[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]&#39;&#39; states that the character [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] maintains speeds which can be considered \&quot;modest\&quot;, especially when carrying a passenger. The Handbook also concedes that a solid object moving in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere at several times the speed of sound or faster would wreak havoc on the planet and that moving at such speeds would prohibit [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] from breathing, while the generated wind/friction would ravage his body. On the other hand, the Handbook states that the character [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] was born with adaptations that make higher speeds possible, such as enhanced [[cardiovascular]], [[respiratory]], [[musculature]], and [[Digestion|digestive]] systems, a more efficient [[metabolism]], better lubricated joints, [[tendon]]s with the [[tensile strength]] of spring steel, unidentified bone composition that can withstand the dynamic shock of his touching the ground at speeds over 100 miles an hour, and a brain that can process information fast enough for him to react to his surroundings at high speed.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&#39;&#39;, by Mark Gruenwald and Peter Sanderson; Volume Five; Pages 55 &amp; 128.&lt;!-- Bibliographic information here is needed. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn [[DC Comics]], the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] family of speedsters derive their abilities from an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|extradimensional]] energy source known as the &#39;&#39;&#39;Speed Force&#39;&#39;&#39;, which grants them superspeed and various other abilities required to use it, such as durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/speed-force-facts/|title=15 Things You Didn&#39;t Know The Speed Force Can Do|date=January 5, 2018|website=CBR}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Speed Force is not the source from which other DC characters with superspeed such as [[Superman]] or [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel/Shazam]] derive their powers.\n\nWriter [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] maintained modest abilities for the speedster character Danny Hilltop in his series &#39;&#39;[[John Byrne\u2019s Next Men]]&#39;&#39;.  Although Danny can keep pace with a race car, the friction generated by his speed melts any footwear he wears, burning his feet.  Thus he runs barefoot, having toughened the soles of his feet through a regimen of pounding increasingly harder materials.&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne\u2019s Next Men #7; September 1992&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOther writers choose not to offer any scientific explanations for the questions raised by the actual use of such abilities. [[Peter David]], whose run on the series &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice]]&#39;&#39; included the junior speedster [[Impulse (DC Comics)|Impulse]], has opined that speedsters are inherently difficult to write: \&quot;Speedsters make me nervous, because if you play them accurately, they&#39;re impossible to beat ... I could deal with Impulse because he was easily distracted.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterdavid.net/archives/000870.html|title=PeterDavid.net: WHAT&#39;CHA WANNA KNOW?|website=www.peterdavid.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterdavid.net/archives/000943.html|title=PeterDavid.net: ANY QUESTIONS?|website=www.peterdavid.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSome speedsters may also end up destroying their surroundings or entire astronomical structures around them by their sheer speed alone if they are not careful enough.\n\n==In other media==\n[[File:Tachyon1.jpg|thumb|A [[webcomic]] speedster character.]]\nSpeedster characters appear in other media such as [[film]], [[video games]], [[anime]] and [[manga]], the most notable being the video game character [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], and &#39;&#39;[[Looney Tunes]]&#39;&#39; characters [[Speedy Gonzales]] and the [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]].\n\nOthers include:\n* Characters in the [[Dragon Ball]] franchise like Goku, Vegeta, and Frieza, who are able to react and keep up insane speeds. During the Universal Survival saga, Dyspo is said to have surpassed the speed of sound and light in his past battles and currently is faster and able to increase his speed several thousands of times. Other characters are as fast if not even faster than Dyspo.\n* [[Daphne Millbrook]] from the [[NBC]] television [[superhero]] drama &#39;&#39;[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;The character is referred to as a \&quot;speedster\&quot; on Page 3 of the August 25, 2008 &#39;&#39;[[TV Guide]]&#39;&#39;, and refers to herself as such in \&quot;[[The Second Coming (Heroes)|The Second Coming]]\&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[List of Ben 10 aliens#XLR8|XLR8]], [[List of Ben 10 aliens#Jetray|Jetray]], and [[List of Ben 10 aliens#Fasttrack|Fasttrack]] from &#39;&#39;[[Ben 10]]&#39;&#39;.\n* [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Rainbow Dash|Rainbow Dash]] from &#39;&#39;[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls]]&#39;&#39;.\n* &#39;&#39;[[One-Punch Man]]&#39;&#39; characters [[Saitama (One Punch Man)|Saitama]], [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Speed o&#39; Sound Sonic|Speed o&#39; Sound Sonic]], and [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Flashy Flash|Flashy Flash]].\n* [[Dashiell Robert Parr|Dash Parr]] from the [[Pixar]] motion picture &#39;&#39;[[The Incredibles]]&#39;&#39;.\n* [[Lab Rats (U.S. TV series)#Cast and characters|Bree Davenport]], the superhero from &#39;&#39;[[Lab Rats (U.S. TV series)|Lab Rats]]&#39;&#39;\n* All Kamen Riders from &#39;&#39;[[Kamen Rider Kabuto]]&#39;&#39;, who have the ability to \&quot;clock up\&quot; and move at supersonic speeds.&lt;ref&gt;While Kabuto himself is most well known for being the fastest Kamen Rider, there have been other Riders before and after him with similar abilities as well.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* A-Train and Shockwave from the comic book &#39;&#39;[[The Boys (comics)|The Boys]]&#39;&#39; and its [[The Boys (2019 TV series)|TV adaptation]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Comics|Speculative fiction}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Speedster (Fiction)}}\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds| Speedster]]\n[[Category:Stock characters]]\n[[Category:Superhero fiction themes]]&quot;</span>
