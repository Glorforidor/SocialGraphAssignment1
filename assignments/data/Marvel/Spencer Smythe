A scientist researching [[robotics]] and [[Arachnid|arachnids]], he turned to crime to finance his research, and dedicated his life to capturing Spider-Man. Smythe is best known for creating the [[Spider-Slayer|Spider-Slayers]], robots designed specifically to hunt down, capture, or kill the web-slinger. He is also the father of [[Alistair Smythe]], who inherited Spencer's creations and hatred for Spider-Man after his death.\n\nThe character has appeared in several Spider-Man adaptations, including animated series and video games.\n\n==Publication history==\nSpencer Smythe and the Spider-Slayers first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #25 (June 1965) and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=338}}</ref> Spencer died in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #192 (May 1979).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nProfessor Spencer Smythe was an expert in robotics and arachnids who asked [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to fund his projects, having been convinced by Jameson's editorials that [[Spider-Man]] was a menace. After watching a demonstration showing that Smythe's robot could sense and track spiders, Jameson hired Smythe to capture Spider-Man. Jameson himself controlled the robot, meaning that Spider-Man was chased by a machine with Jameson's face. However, the web-slinger escaped by leaving the Spider-Man suit wrapped in the robot's tentacles.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #105</ref>\n\nAnnoyed at his robot's inability to capture Spider-Man, Smythe began to obsess about the web-slinger, turning to crime to finance his research and constantly improving his robots which he dubbed [[Spider-Slayer]]s.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #106-107</ref><ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=6}}</ref> But his creations, no matter how deadly or powerful he made, were always defeated by Spider-Man utilizing a key flaw in their designs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #107</ref>\n\nEventually, Smythe's criminal career came to an end when the radioactive materials used in the robots' manufacture poisoned him, dooming him to a slow and agonizing death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #186</ref> Blaming Spider-Man and Jameson equally for his impending demise, Smythe handcuffed the two together with a bomb scheduled to detonate in 24 hours, determined to make the two suffer the agony of inescapable death that he saw the two as having condemned him to.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #190</ref> Unfortunately for Smythe, his disease was too advanced for him to survive the 24 hours himself, and he died convinced that he had killed off the two responsible. Peter Parker, however, had a pretty good grasp of what made mechanical devices tick, and was able to abort the bomb by freezing its controls mere moments before it would have detonated.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #192</ref>\n\nAfter Spencer's death, his son [[Alistair Smythe]] inherited the Spider-Slayer legacy.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual 19</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Spencer Smythe is cloned by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]]'s company New U Technologies.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy'' #2</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* A similar character named '''Henry Smythe''' appeared in the 1967 ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by Henry Ramer. Like Spencer, this version is the creator of the Spider-Slayers, as seen in \"Captured by J. Jonah Jameson\", in which he used one to capture Spider-Man for the [[J. Jonah Jameson|eponymous character]]. However, Spider-Man is eventually able to escape from the robot's clutches after tricking it with a dummy, leaving Smythe to take it back to his house to make adjustments.[[Image:STAS Spencer Smythe.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Spencer Smythe as seen in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]\n* Spencer Smythe appeared in 1994's ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Edward Mulhare]]. In the episode \"The Spider Slayer\", [[Norman Osborn]] enlists Spencer to capture Spider-Man in exchange for building a hover-chair for his paralyzed son, Alistair. Smythe creates his first Spider-Slayer, the Black Widow, to achieve this, but it instead kidnaps [[Flash Thompson]], who was wearing a Spider-Man costume. When the real Spider-Man comes to the rescue, the ensuing battles leads to a fire at [[Oscorp]]. With negative reinforcement from Osborn, Spencer stays to ensure Spider-Man dies and Alistair gets his hover-chair, but is seemingly killed when Oscorp explodes. It is later revealed that Spencer survived and was put into [[Cryopreservation|cryogenic suspension]] by the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] to ensure Alistair's loyalty after he fell in with him. Alistair, after becoming the cyborg Ultimate Spider-Slayer, eventually discovers Spencer's cryonically preserved body and recovered it with Spider-Man's help. Afterwards, Alistair continues working for [[Silvermane|various]] [[Jackal (Marvel Comics character)|resourceful]] [[Red Skull|individuals]] in exchange for his father's revival.\n* Spencer Smythe appears in the 2010s ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]. This version is [[Peter Parker]] and [[Harry Osborn]]'s strict science teacher at [[Midtown High School]], and the estranged father of Alistair Smythe. In the episode \"Horizon High Pt. 1\", he sabotages Harry's experiment on the latter's father, [[Norman Osborn|Norman]]'s, behalf, resulting in Harry's suspension from Horizon High. Smythe later allied himself with the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] to seek revenge against [[Max Modell]], and creates his first Spider-Slayer to steal Harry's work from Horizon High before it is eventually destroyed by Spider-Man. An investigation later reveals Smythe's involvement in sabotaging Harry's experiment and he is fired from Midtown High. In the episode \"Ultimate Spider-Man\", Spencer is hired by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics character)|Raymond Warren]] to steal Oscorp's genetically modified spiders. To do this, he programs one of his Spider-Slayers to attack Norman and threaten to destroy Oscorp while he steals the spiders. However, he bumps into [[Miles Morales]] on his way out and loses one of the specimens, which later turns Miles into the Ultimate Spider-Man. Spencer later personally operates a Spider-Slayer to try and capture the Ultimate Spider-Man and fights his son in his own Spider-Slayer, who was sent by Norman for the same task. The two are eventually defeated by Spider-Man and the Ultimate Spider-Man, though only Spencer is arrested, as Alistair manages to escape.\n\n===Film===\nA viral marketing campaign for ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' featured a ''Daily Bugle'' article that mentioned Spencer Smythe as Oscorp's head of the engineering division and that he is working on significant advancements in robotics. An article published at a later date revealed that he was fired from his position as department head and replaced by his son Alistair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedailybugle.tumblr.com/post/64030198371/by-joy-mercado-financial-bureau-despite-the|title=Oscorp Biz Holds Steady|last=Mercado|first=Joy|publisher=Tumblr|date=October 14, 2013|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://thedailybugle.tumblr.com/post/68949122520/by-joy-mercado-oscorp-industries-wants-to-usher]</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Spencer Smythe is featured in the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions of ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]''. He calls Spider-Man at specific points of the game and is shown to be in alliance with [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics character)|Jackal]]. He has A.I.M. help him with his secret experiments in their underground lab, as well capture and clone J. Jonah Jameson as part of a plot to discredit both him and Spider-Man. Later, the Jackal reveals that Smythe is trying to find a way to control the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]] and betrays him to pursue his own goals. Near the end of the game, Smythe sends A.I.M. and a brainwashed [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] to retrieve a sonic generator that could stop the symbiote invasion, giving the Jackal an opportunity to steal it himself. After A.I.M. and Black Cat are defeated, Spider-Man calls Smythe to accuse him of having the Jackal steal the sonic generator, but he denies any involvement.\n* Spencer Smythe appears in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]''.\n* Spencer Smythe replaces Alistair as the primary antagonist of the [[Nintendo 3ds|Nintendo 3DS]] version of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game.
