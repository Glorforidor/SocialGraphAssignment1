The character&#39;s name, appearance, and personality were patterned after Johns&#39; sister Courtney, who died in the explosion of [[TWA Flight 800]] in 1996.\n\nCourtney Whitmore was originally known as the second &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Star-Spangled Kid]]&#39;&#39;&#39;, but she began using the name \&quot;Stargirl\&quot; after she was presented with the Cosmic Staff by [[Starman (Jack Knight)|Jack Knight]].\n\nStargirl has appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Action]]&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]&#39;&#39;.

Courtney appears in most issues of &#39;&#39;JSA&#39;&#39; and it is in these pages that her half sister Patricia Dugan is born.\n\n[[Image:cassaday stargirl.jpg|thumb|upright|Starman and Stargirl on the cover of &#39;&#39;JSA: All Stars&#39;&#39; #4 (Oct. 2003); art by [[John Cassaday]].]]\nLater, she confronts her predecessor&#39;s killer, [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Driven further into madness by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]&#39;s chemical assault, Grundy attacks the JSA headquarters with the head of the Statue of Liberty. With the aid of [[Jakeem Thunder]], Courtney fights Grundy in the streets and into the sewers below. The young heroes barely defeat Grundy. [[Johnny Thunderbolt|Johnny]] [[Thunderbolt (DC Comics)|Thunderbolt]] repairs the Statue. Grundy later develops an obsession with Courtney.\n\nCourtney encounters [[Merry Pemberton]], the sister of the original Star-Spangled Kid, during the \&quot;Sins of Youth\&quot; storyline. Merry&#39;s concerns about her brother&#39;s legacy and about young superheroes battling adults causes friction with Courtney. They resolve their differences during a battle against the forces of [[Klarion the Witch Boy]]. Courtney later saves Merry&#39;s life during an attack by [[Amazo]]. During this incident, Courtney is magically aged to an adult by Klarion.\n\nLater, she discovers her biological father [[Sam Kurtis]] working as a common thug for an incarnation of the [[Royal Flush Gang]]. They later confront each other during one of the Flush Gang&#39;s robberies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]; [[David S.

In this issue, Stargirl meets a temporarily powerless Billy Batson, and each learns that the other is sixteen years old.&lt;/ref&gt; To outsiders, however, Captain Marvel is by all appearances an adult, and the relationship between Marvel and Stargirl draws criticism from [[Jakeem Thunder]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]. After Garrick confronts them, Marvel leaves the JSA and Courtney, instead of revealing his secret to the team. Marvel later returns to the JSA and explains that the Wisdom of Solomon prevents him from revealing his secret identity.\n\nA glimpse into the future shows an adult \&quot;Starwoman\&quot; married to [[Albert Rothstein]], the JSA member known as Atom Smasher.\n\n====JSA/JSA and Black Vengeance====\nCourtney&#39;s family is murdered by agents of [[Per Degaton]]. She travels with the rest of the JSA to 1951. The [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] successors to [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] JSA members meet and fight alongside the originals to save her family and the future. She finds herself forced to work with Atom Smasher again, for the first time since he defected to [[Black Adam]]&#39;s rival team. During her trip to the past, Courtney is briefly stuck in an asylum when she tried to recruit Ted Knight, who has become clinically depressed for his perceived role in the creation of the atomic bomb to the point that he initially thought Courtney was a hallucination, but she was saved by a figure later identified as Starwoman, an adult version of her infant sister Patricia. After the crisis is over, Courtney forgives Al for his past alliance with Black Adam, but Atom Smasher is nearly killed by [[Spectre (comics)|the Spectre]] during an attack on Khandaq. He survives, but the event reveals the depth of Courtney&#39;s feelings for him. She returns to her own time to find her family alive again.\n\nLater, Atom Smasher is tried and convicted for his actions while working for Black Adam. During a TV appearance, Courtney says that with Al in prison, she would \&quot;be there for him... no matter how long it takes.\&quot;\n\n====&#39;&#39;Infinite Crisis&#39;&#39;====\n{{main|Infinite Crisis}}\n\nCourtney is approached by the [[Shade (comics)|Shade]], who tells her that her biological father is dead. This tragedy and her experience of the relationship between [[Liberty Belle (comics)|Liberty Belle]] and [[Jesse Chambers|Jesse Quick]] prompts her to re-evaluate her family life.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;JSA&#39;&#39; #81 (March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; She discovers that she can&#39;t hate her biological father for his failings as a father and as a man. She also learns to accept Pat Dugan as her only real father figure.\n\nStargirl becomes part of a coalition consisting of the JSA, the Doom Patrol and the Teen Titans that is organized to stop [[Superboy-Prime]] from destroying [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]]. Superboy-Prime kills several of the Titans, including [[Pantha]] and [[Baby Wildebeest]] and maims [[Risk (comics)|Risk]], removing his arm. Stargirl later attends a memorial service for heroes who died in the Crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite comic | writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] | penciller=[[Phil Jimenez|Jimenez, Phil]], [[Jim Lee|Lee, Jim]], [[Jerry Ordway|Ordway, Jerry]], [[George P\u00e9rez|P\u00e9rez, George]], [[Ivan Reis|Reis, Ivan]] | title=[[Infinite Crisis]] (hardcover edition) | date=2006 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | location=[[New York, NY]] | id={{ISBN|1-4012-0959-9}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfterwards, she begins attending college. She has altered her equipment: her rod now telescopes into a small cylinder, and her costume and belt materialize as the rod extends to full size.\n\n===\&quot;One Year Later\&quot;===\nCourtney joins the new roster of the Justice Society and fights without S.T.R.I.P.E.&#39;s assistance.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Justice Society of America]]&#39;&#39; #1, (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA seasoned hero despite her age, she forges a bond with her young teammate [[Cyclone (DC Comics)|Cyclone]], the eager and over-impulsive granddaughter of the first [[Red Tornado (Ma Hunkel)|Red Tornado]].

Courtney suggests Cyclone create a new superhero costume and name.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; #3, (2008).

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA future version of Courtney is seen in &#39;&#39;[[Teen Titans]]&#39;&#39; #53 along with [[Lex Luthor]] and his future Titans. Her role is minimal. She is, however, wearing Jack Knight&#39;s goggles and jacket\u2014the closest she has ever come to Jack&#39;s vision of \&quot;Starwoman\&quot; at the end of his series.\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39; miniseries, Courtney joins with other heroes to form an underground resistance against [[Darkseid]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39; #1\u20135. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCourtney is present (and apparently involved in voting) for discussions on how to move the JSA forward after the Gog debacle (and whom to retain or remove from the team); she defends some of the heroes who sided with Gog. Later she is present when the JSA meet a depowered Billy Batson who reveals his [[secret identity]] to the others.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #23 (January 2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter the battle with [[Black Adam]] and [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], Courtney was unhappy as the events had happened on her birthday (and had ruined any planned celebrations). When she went home and opened the door, the entire Justice Society had prepared a late surprise party for her. Later she was unhappy to learn she still needed her braces even as she was acknowledged as one of the senior members of the JSA.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #26 (April 2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been established that both she and Atom Smasher love each other in direct quotes rather than asides and implied habits, but the elder JSA members&#39; comments about their age difference forced Al to turn Courtney down, stating he loved her \&quot;like a sister\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #27 (May 2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #28 (June 2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFollowing a massive supervillain attack, the JSA is split in two. [[Power Girl]] convinces Courtney to join the JSA All-Stars splinter group. She later expresses a deep feeling of regret over siding with the All-Stars, claiming that she feels more at home with the original roster. Karen talks her through these doubts, telling her that she needed Courtney on the team because all the other teen members of the JSA look up to her.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;JSA All-Stars&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The New 52===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC&#39;s continuity. In this new timeline, Stargirl appears as part of a new &#39;&#39;[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]&#39;&#39; title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/new-justice-league-of-america.html|title=New Details on GEOFF JOHNS JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA Series|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Courtney Whitmore was cleaning out the office of Barbara Whitmore&#39;s boyfriend Pat Dugan when she found a staff, a belt, and a shirt with a star on it. While trying them on, she became Stargirl and caught the perpetrator of a fire she spotted. The heroic actions went viral.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League of America&#39;&#39; #9. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After talking to her friend about what happens next, Courtney was informed by Pat that the person who originally wielded the equipment has died. Though Pat agreed to train her, Courtney had to respond to the criminal activity caused by [[Shadow Thief]] who was taking hostages to draw out a superhero. She managed to rout out Shadow Thief.

She and her partner [[S.T.R.I.P.E.]] have a speaking role in the episode \&quot;Chaos at the Earth&#39;s Core\&quot;. In that story, Stargirl is childishly jealous of [[Supergirl]]&#39;s fame. But in the resulting adventure in Skartaris, the girls come to an understanding. Stargirl also appears in the episode \&quot;Patriot Act\&quot;, where she and other non-metahuman Justice League members were trying to stop the mutated [[General Wade Eiling]] from rampaging through Metropolis. In this story, Stargirl reveals that she has no inherent powers and all of her special abilities come from her staff, and she takes the original Star-Spangled Kid&#39;s place in the symbolic and unofficial reformation of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]. Stargirl gets badly injured but survived the incident and flashes a smile when she is loaded into an ambulance. Stargirl makes non-voiced appearances in \&quot;Epilogue\&quot; fighting the [[Royal Flush Gang]], and later with S.T.R.I.P.E. in the series finale \&quot;Destroyer\&quot; in helping repel the invasion of Earth by [[Darkseid]]&#39;s forces.\n* Courtney Whitmore appears in the teaser segment of the &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Hope Levy]].

Stargirl is also shown through the episode to have a girly interest in a red cat-like alien which inhabits the Fortress&#39; Zoo, which she refers to as an \&quot;Alien Kitty\&quot;. Sometimes she will ride her staff like a broom similar to Samantha Stephens from &#39;&#39;[[Bewitched]]&#39;&#39;.\n* Stargirl appears in &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Whitney Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/01/04/young-justice-outsiders-is-now-streaming-on-dc-universe/|title=&#39;&#39;Young Justice: Outsiders&#39;&#39; Is Now Streaming On DC Universe|website=ComicBook|last=Vick|first=Megan|accessdate=January 4, 2019|date=January 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this show, Courtney Whitmore is the host of the Goode World Studios&#39; news show, &#39;&#39;Stargirl&#39;&#39;.\n\n===Film===\n* Stargirl is set to appear in the upcoming &#39;&#39;[[Black Adam (film)|Black Adam]]&#39;&#39; film, set in the [[DC Extended Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thathashtagshow.com/2019/03/08/exclusive-new-black-adam-script-features-hakwman-atom-smasher-and-stargirl/|title=EXCLUSIVE: New \u2018BLACK ADAM\u2019 Script Features Hawkman, Atom Smasher and Stargirl|website=That Hastag Show|last=Murphy|first=Charles|accessdate=March 8, 2019|date=March 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Video games===\n* Stargirl makes a cameo appearance in &#39;&#39;[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]&#39;&#39;.
