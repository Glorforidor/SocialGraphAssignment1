Based on the [[Asgard|realm of the same name]] from [[Norse mythology]], Asgard is home to the Asgardians and other beings adapted from Norse mythology. Asgard first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Journey into Mystery]]&#39;&#39; #85 (October 1962) by [[Stan Lee]], [[Larry Lieber]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and features prominently in stories that follow the Marvel Comics superhero [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who appeared two issues earlier.\n\nAsgard has appeared in comics and various media adaptations, including the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films &#39;&#39;[[Thor (film)|Thor]]&#39;&#39; (2011), &#39;&#39;[[Thor: The Dark World]]&#39;&#39; (2013), &#39;&#39;[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]&#39;&#39; (2015), &#39;&#39;[[Thor: Ragnarok]]&#39;&#39; (2017), and &#39;&#39;[[Avengers: Endgame]]&#39;&#39; (2019).\n\n==Fictional history==\nAccording to Asgardian legend, in the beginning there was nothing, but in time two worlds came into being on opposite sides of the void. The one to the north was named [[Niflheim]], a world of clouds and shadows in whose center surged the fountain [[Hvergelmir]], from which flowed twelve rivers of ice. The one to the south was named [[M\u00faspellsheimr|Muspelheim]], which teemed with rivers of fire. Eventually the warm air from the south carved out the ice giant [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]] from the ice in the north. Ymir became the father of all the giants, and his cow [[Au\u00f0umbla]] licked out of the ice the first Asgardian, Buri. Buri had a son named Borr, who married the giantess Bestla. Borr and Bestla had three sons named [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], Vili, and Ve, who were known as the [[\u00c6sir]]. Odin and his brothers grew to hate the giants and slew Ymir, and his blood formed a great sea. Odin and his brothers then raised Ymir&#39;s body from the sea and created [[Midgard]] between Niflheim and Muspelheim. With Ymir&#39;s bones they created mountains, and with his hair they created trees. They then raised Ymir&#39;s skull upon four pillars to create the heavens. Within the skull contained sparks from Muspelheim, which became the sun, moon, and stars. When Midgard was complete, Odin and his brothers created a home for themselves above it called Asgard. Between the two worlds they stretched a rainbow bridge and called it [[Bifr\u00f6st]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;annual4\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Thor Annual&#39;&#39; vol. 1, #4 (1976). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOnce a year Odin must undertake the Odinsleep to regain his strength. During this time Asgard is vulnerable to attack from its many enemies, most notably Odin&#39;s adopted son, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. Loki first takes command of Asgard during the Odinsleep, using his right as the &#39;son&#39; of Odin before Thor could claim it, but fled when Asgard was invaded by [[Mangog]] as he realized that this new foe was too powerful.&lt;ref name=\&quot;thor154157\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Thor&#39;&#39; #154-157 (July - Oct. 1968). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Loki later usurped the throne of Asgard by taking the Odinring, but fled again when Asgard was invaded by the fire demon, [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;thor175177\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Thor&#39;&#39; #175-177 (Apr. - June 1970). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe throne of Asgard later passes to [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] after Odin is killed in battle by Surtur, when the demon invades Earth.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thor&#39;&#39; #40 vol. 2, (October 2001). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIt was prophesied that Loki would lead Asgard&#39;s enemies in a final conflict known as [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], which would lead to its destruction. This comes to pass when Loki obtains the forge that created [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] and creates new uru hammers for his army. The entirety of Asgard and its inhabitants are destroyed in the resulting battle.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thor&#39;&#39; vol. 2, #80-85 (Aug. - Dec. 2004). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter Ragnar\u00f6k, Donald Blake awakens Thor from the \&quot;Void of Non-Existence\&quot;. Thor returns to Earth and rebuilds Asgard outside of [[Broxton, Oklahoma]], purchasing the land with gold from the treasury. Thor then goes about restoring the Asgardians, who have been reborn in the bodies of mortal men and women.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thor&#39;&#39; vol. 3, #1-5 (Sept. 2007 - Jan. 2008). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAsgard&#39;s location on Earth makes the city a target during the \&quot;[[Secret Invasion]]\&quot; by the [[Skrull]]s led by a [[Super-Skrull]] named Godkiller, whose powers mimic [[Thundra]], [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]], [[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Volcana]] and [[Battleaxe (comics)|Battleaxe]]. The aliens are repelled with help from Thor&#39;s ally, [[Beta Ray Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Invasion: Thor&#39;&#39;, #1-3 (Oct. - Dec. 2008). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen Thor is forced to abdicate the throne and is exiled for killing his grandfather [[Bor (Marvel Comics)|Bor]], who was brought from the past and driven mad by Loki, control of Asgard passes to Thor&#39;s half-brother, [[Balder (comics)|Balder]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thor&#39;&#39; #600 (Apr. 2009). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAsgard is destroyed yet again after [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] seizes control of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] following the Secret Invasion as he seeks to expel Asgard from [[United States|U.S.]] soil in an effort to consolidate power. Osborn leads the [[Dark Avengers]] in the [[Siege (comics)|Siege of Asgard]]. The invading forces are defeated with help from the reunited [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], although Asgard itself is toppled by the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]. Immediately following the Siege, Thor reerects [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]]&#39;s observatory atop [[Stark Tower]] as sign of solidarity with Midgard and appreciation for the Avengers&#39; aid.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]&#39;&#39;, #1-4 (Mar. - June 2010). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThor restores Odin to the throne when the nine realms are invaded by \&quot;the World Eaters\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thor&#39;&#39; #618 (December 2010). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Thor and Odin&#39;s long-forgotten brother [[Serpent (comics)|Cul]], kill each other in battle during the \&quot;[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\&quot; event, Odin passes control of Asgard to the [[Vanir]], headed by the \&quot;All-Mother\&quot;, a [[triumvirate]] of female deities consisting of [[Freya (comics)|Freyja]], [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]] and [[Idunn (comics)|Idunn]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Fear Itself&#39;&#39; #7.2 (2011). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]&#39;s company, Stark Resilient then rebuilds Asgard over Broxton, Oklahoma, where it is rechristened as \&quot;&#39;&#39;&#39;Asgardia&#39;&#39;&#39;\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Mighty Thor&#39;&#39; #11 (February 2012). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the \&quot;[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]\&quot; storyline, it is revealed that there is a Tenth Realm in Asgard called Heven that is inhabited by [[Angel]]s. It was cut off from the rest of the realms following the Angels&#39; attack on Asgard which led to the apparent death of an infant [[Angela (comics)|Angela]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Original Sin&#39;&#39; #5.1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAsgard later established the Congress of Worlds which consists of the representatives of the Nine Realms.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Mighty Thor&#39;&#39; #10. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After Heven was reintegrated with the other Realms, representatives of Heven started appearing as members of the Congress of Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Loki: Agent of Asgard&#39;&#39; #14.

They are extremely long-lived (though not purely [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Immortality|immortal]] like their [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian]] counterparts), aging at an extremely slow rate upon reaching adulthood (through the periodic consumption of the [[Golden apple#Norse mythology|golden apples]] of [[Idunn (Marvel Comics)|Idunn]]). Asgardian flesh and bone is three times denser than similar human tissue, contributing to their [[superhuman strength]] and weight. An average Asgardian male can lift 30 [[Short ton|tons]] (27.2 [[metric ton]]s); an average Asgardian female can lift about 25 tons (22.7 metric tons). Asgardians are immune to all terrestrial diseases and resistant to conventional injury (however this resilience seems relatively incapable of defeating the [[Marvel Zombies|zombie plague]] in Earth-2149 that affects even Asgardians). The metabolism of the Asgardians gives them superhuman stamina in all physical activities.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ohothmu\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Deluxe Edition]]&#39;&#39;, #1: &#39;&#39;Abomination to Batroc&#39;s Brigade&#39;&#39; (August 1985). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDemons are [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Fire and heat manipulation|beings of fire]] and tend to be about the same stature as the Asgardians.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ohothmu\&quot; /&gt;\n\nDwarves are smaller in stature than the Asgardians, and have short, stocky bodies. Their average height is four feet (1.2 meters).&lt;ref name=\&quot;ohothmu\&quot; /&gt;\n\nElves vary greatly in size from four to eight feet (1.2 to 2.4 meters). They tend toward slender bodies and proportionately longer limbs. The dark elves tend to be darker in color than the light elves. Both types have natural proclivity towards magic.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ohothmu\&quot; /&gt;\n\nGiants are basically humanoid in appearance and color although they tend toward the [[neanderthal]]ic in body and bone structure. Their most distinguishing feature is their height. The average giant is twenty feet (6 meters) tall, although some may reach thirty feet (9.1 meters). On occasion giants will produce stunted offspring who look similar to the Asgardians. [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] and the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]] are both children of giants despite their diminutive six or seven foot (1.8 or 2.1 meter) stature.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ohothmu\&quot; /&gt;\n\nTrolls are the least human-looking of the denizens of Asgard, possessing body characteristics that are almost simian. Trolls are stocky and massive, have thick body hair (almost fur) and tend toward a ruddy orange color. They are on average taller than the Asgardians but shorter than giants, around seven feet (2.1 meters) tall, although some trolls are considerably taller. Trolls tend to be extremely strong, stronger than the average Asgardian, dwarf or elf and on par with giants. Trolls like [[Ulik]] rival Thor in strength.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ohothmu\&quot; /&gt;\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n\n===Flora===\n[[File:Asgard the nine worlds.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram showing the relationship of [[Yggdrasil]] with the nine worlds of Asgard.
