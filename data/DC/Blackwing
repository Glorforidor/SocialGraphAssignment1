When he debuted, he was a costumed animal trainer for the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]&#39;s [[Circus of Crime]].

He participated in the capture of [[Foggy Nelson]]. Blackwing battled Daredevil, [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Nick Fury]], and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and was once again defeated by Daredevil.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Daredevil&#39;&#39; #122-123. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBlackwing later teamed up with [[Jack O&#39;Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Steven Levins|Jack O&#39;Lantern]] to stake out his father&#39;s house when the [[Red Skull]] took the control of the base, turning the dilapidated mansion into his so-called Skull House. The duo searched Skullhouse and battled [[Captain America]] during this event.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; #396-397. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwing and Jack O&#39;Lantern were recruited by [[Mother Night (comics)|Mother Night]] to join the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]] after the Red Skull was impressed with their abilities.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; #398. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwing, Jack O&#39;Lantern, and [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]] fought [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] before they joined the Skeleton Crew. Blackwing captured Diamondback,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; #405-408. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; and then battled Diamondback as she escaped.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; #409. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He and the rest of the Skeleton Crew were defeated by Captain America, Diamondback, and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]. He was defeated in combat by Falcon, and taken to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; #410.

He was defeated alongside them.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thunderbolts&#39;&#39; #24-25. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter that last defeat, Joseph abandoned the Blackwing identity and became a crime lord creating his own private villains in [[Heavy Mettle]]. He ordered Firestrike to bring him the battle suit of [[New Warriors]] member [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]] in hopes of proving himself to his father and the other crime bosses of New York.&lt;ref name=\&quot;NW3-4\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;New Warriors&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #3-4.
