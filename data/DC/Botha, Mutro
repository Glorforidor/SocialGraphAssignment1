The character was created by [[Bruce Timm]] and [[Paul Dini]] and first appeared in the pilot episode of the [[animated television series]] &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond]]&#39;&#39; (1999\u20132001), voiced by [[Will Friedle]].\n\nTerry McGinnis is the vigilante known as &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Batman]]&#39;&#39;&#39; in the future, having taken over the name after the aging Bruce Wayne went into retirement. In the [[DC animated universe]] continuity, he eventually learns that he is the biological son of Bruce Wayne (under a covert genetic engineering by [[Project Cadmus]]) unbeknownst to him and Bruce at first being that the former was conceived and raised by [[List of Batman Beyond characters#Terry&#39;s Family|Warren McGinnis]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\nMcGinnis was created for the &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; animated television series, as a continuation of &#39;&#39;[[The New Batman Adventures]]&#39;&#39;, originally meant as a character for the DCAU. For a long time, he was not considered a character for the main DC Universe. Countdown introduced Earth-12, an alternate universe with its own version of Terry McGinnis and other Beyond-like characters. &#39;&#39;[[Superman Batman]] (comic book) #22 (2005, which predates Superman Batman Annual 4) was the first comic to depict McGinnis as existing in the future of Batman and the characters of the mainstream comic book DCU. In Batman # 700, Terry&#39;s mentor is not Bruce, but [[Damian Wayne]], who had become the third Batman after Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson (in other words Terry would be the fourth Batman).\n\nThe 2010 story &#39;&#39;Superman Batman Annual&#39;&#39; #4 returned to the DCAU Terry&#39;s story, as later did a 2011 &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; miniseries. From 2012, DC began publishing three Terry-related comic books: &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Justice League Beyond&#39;&#39; most prominently, though the character also appears in &#39;&#39;Superman Beyond&#39;&#39;. Terry officially  entered mainstream DC continuity in the 2014 [[The New 52|New 52]] maxiseries, &#39;&#39;[[The New 52: Futures End]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=New52&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/dc-readies-weekly-series-futures-end-spring |title=DC Readies Weekly Weekly Series, &#39;Futures End&#39; for Spring |last=Moore |first=Matt |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2013-12-11 |accessdate=2019-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407234024/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/dc-readies-weekly-series-futures-end-spring |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since then produced two separate comic book series, the first in 2015 where [[Tim Drake]] has replaced Terry as Batman, and the second one in 2016 which is part of [[DC Rebirth]] where Terry has become Batman once again.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===&#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;===\nTerry was born in [[Gotham City]] to [[List of Batman Beyond characters#Terry&#39;s Family|Warren and Mary McGinnis]], a research scientist at Wayne-Powers and an [[astronomer]] at Astro-Tech respectively on August 18, 2023. By his own admission, he was once a \&quot;bad kid\&quot;. As a former member of a [[Gang|street gang]] run by youthful racketeer Charlie \&quot;Big Time\&quot; Bigelow, Terry had his fair share of run-ins with the [[Gotham City Police Department|Gotham City Police]] at age fourteen while his parents were going through a divorce, even serving a three-month stint in [[Youth detention center|juvenile hall]] (having been underage, he is spared Charlie&#39;s three-year sentence where Charlie was old enough to be tried as an adult).\n\n[[File:Terry mcginnis.png|upright|thumb|left|A 16-year-old Terry McGinnis; from the animated series &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;.]]\nTwenty years after Batman is last seen, Terry finds himself on the run from the [[Jokerz]], another street gang, who have modeled themselves after the long-dead Gotham City legendary criminal, [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]. Terry flees onto the grounds of [[Wayne Manor]], where an aged [[Bruce Wayne]] comes to his defense. The strain of the fight places substantial stress on Bruce&#39;s weak [[heart]], so Terry helps Bruce into the mansion and gets him his medication; Bruce proceeds to fall asleep afterward. Before leaving, Terry notices a [[bat]] stuck inside a [[grandfather clock]]. As he tries to free it, he stumbles upon the entrance to the [[Batcave]] and realizes that the elder man was the city&#39;s heroic [[Batman|Dark Knight]]. He is then forced to leave by an enraged Bruce.\n\nTerry returns home to find his father murdered, ostensibly by Jokerz. He later discovers that [[Derek Powers]] (who has assumed leadership of a merged Wayne-Powers) ordered Warren&#39;s death after the latter discovered Powers&#39; plan to mass-produce [[biological warfare|biological weapons]]. Powers&#39; right-hand man Mr. Fixx leads a raid on the McGinnis home and shoots Warren McGinnis. (In the comic books, he orders one of his henchmen, who is a great grand-nephew of [[Joe Chill]], to shoot Warren).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic\n| writer = \n| cowriters = [[Dustin Nguyen (artist)|Dustin Nguyen]], [[Derek Fridolfs]], [[Adam Beechen]], [[J.

Bruce suggests that Terry take the evidence against Powers to the current commissioner of police but, after a scuffle with Powers during which Derek is able to reclaim the evidence, Terry takes matters into his own hands and steals the latest incarnation of the [[Batsuit]]. Despite some initial mistrust, their similar backgrounds convince Bruce to aid Terry. Terry successfully derails Powers&#39; plan, exposing Powers to his own hazardous chemicals in the process, resulting in his [[mutation]] into [[Derek Powers|Blight]].\n\nConvinced that there is still a need for a Batman, Bruce hires Terry as his \&quot;[[personal assistant]]\&quot; and begins secretly training him for his new role as Gotham&#39;s Dark Knight. In addition, Bruce assists Terry in the field primarily by keeping in continual contact with him from the Batcave. Beyond the vigilante duties as Batman, Terry is also Bruce&#39;s [[chauffeur]] and provides assistance with Bruce&#39;s daily business and personal tasks at his home and office, which also allows him to bond with Bruce&#39;s dog [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]] when he helps him care for the [[Great Dane]]. In time, the pair develops a bond of trust and respect, and confide in each other not only just their mutual missions, but also life issues as well, similar to a father and son. Bruce would even trust Terry over [[Barbara Gordon]]&#39;s words when the villain [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]] frames Terry for murder with another one of his illusions.\n\nAfter Powers&#39; criminal identity is revealed to the public and he finally brings [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] to his father&#39;s killer, Terry decides to continue his role as Batman to make up for his past sins, in the hope that it is his chance at [[Salvation|redemption]]. Later in his career as Batman, he has a confrontation with an elderly [[Amanda Waller]], who reveals that she engineered his origin to create a replacement Batman for Bruce Wayne. McGinnis learns that Wayne is his biological father; Waller used nanotechnology to ensure that Bruce Wayne&#39;s DNA overwrote the DNA in Warren McGinnis&#39;s reproductive cells. She had intended to take things one step forward and recreate the tragic circumstances that drove Bruce into becoming the Batman (by hiring The Phantasm to murder the young boy&#39;s parents in front of him), but her hired assassin refused at the last minute. In conclusion, Waller tells Terry that while he does not possess Bruce&#39;s level of deduction and analytical skills, he does possess the same heart.\n\n===Project Batman Beyond===\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]\&quot;, which takes place 15 years after &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond]]&#39;&#39;, Terry discovers the shocking truth about his paternity. When Bruce requires tissue for the [[cloning]] of a [[kidney]] to transplant, Terry is checked for compatibility. To his surprise, his [[DNA]] is almost identical to Bruce&#39;s. After hesitating for a time, he runs a DNA test and finds out that Bruce is his biological father. Terry tracks down [[Amanda Waller]], the only person in the world he believes can answer his questions. As he does so, he imagines scenarios where he leaves the people important to himself because he believes his life was a lie.\n\nTerry vents some of his frustration about Bruce and his plans to Waller, only to be surprised when Waller reveals that it was not Bruce who was responsible for Terry&#39;s [[gene]]tic makeup - it was her, without Bruce&#39;s consent or even knowledge.\n\nDecades earlier, Waller was the government liaison to the Justice League and she slowly began to realize and believe that Batman was the most capable person in the League; despite not having any powers, his willpower, body strength, and acute intelligence made him the most balanced and reliable fighter in the entire League. Because of this, Waller slowly began to respect and trust Bruce Wayne. However, Waller noticed something as the years went by: Batman was human. As such, he was getting older and more and more unable to handle the day-to-day intensities as a crimefighting superhero. She knew that one day Batman would have to retire, or there would be the chance that he&#39;d be killed by one of his enemies eventually. Fearing that fact and believing the world always needed Batman, she decided to create a new one.\n\nWaller, with old connections to [[Project Cadmus]], gathered the technology necessary for her movement, codenamed \&quot;Project Batman Beyond.\&quot; Bruce Wayne&#39;s DNA was obtained from a mission where he got injured - a small blood sample on a piece of gauze left at the scene of the mission. Years later in Neo Gotham, she found [[List of Batman Beyond characters#Terry&#39;s Family|a couple]] that was psychologically identical to Bruce&#39;s parents. Warren McGinnis was called in to get a routine [[Flu vaccine|flu shot]] that was actually a [[Project Cadmus]] [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] solution that was used to reconstruct the DNA within his [[reproductive system]] to match Bruce Wayne&#39;s. A short while later - approximately one year - Mary McGinnis gave birth to Terry, who was a combination of her and Bruce.\n\nWaller executed the final phase of her plan when Terry was eight years old. She hired an assassin - [[Andrea Beaumont]], Bruce Wayne&#39;s former fianc\u00e9e and the enigmatic Phantasm - to kill Terry&#39;s parents so that the trauma of seeing his parents murdered in front of him would cause Terry to someday become Batman. However, Beaumont got cold feet at the last minute and realized that to commit murder in Batman&#39;s name would dishonor his legacy. Waller, realizing that Beaumont was right, cancelled the project, resulting in [[List of Batman Beyond characters#Terry&#39;s Family|Matt]], Terry&#39;s brother, being born later. Nevertheless, eight years later, Terry&#39;s father was murdered and the young teen encountered Bruce, sealing Terry&#39;s fate. Waller&#39;s admission of guilt and affirmation of Terry&#39;s destiny allowed Terry to overcome his anger and bitterness. Terry then decided to propose to longtime girlfriend [[#Dana Tan|Dana]].\n\nAccording to episode co-writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], Bruce, as a master detective, becomes aware that Terry and Matt are his genetic offspring at some point after Terry assumes the role of Batman, and figures out the machinations of Waller and Project Cadmus; however, he never brings it up out of respect for Warren McGinnis, and because he wants Terry to be his own man. He also comes to love Terry and Matt as his sons.\n\nThis project was used in the &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; original comic book miniseries, with the &#39;&#39;Beyond&#39;&#39; version of [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] being a twisted clone of Dick Grayson created after the original Dick was badly injured in a fight; Waller had reasoned that a clone of Grayson would be easier to control than one of Bruce, but the new Grayson went insane, killing most of Batman&#39;s survived-but-retired villains and nearly triggering a new earthquake before he was defeated by McGinnis, the original Grayson, and the new Catwoman.\n\n===DC Main Universe===\nThe &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond]]&#39;&#39; concept became [[DC Comics]] [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] in the pages of &#39;&#39;[[Superman/Batman]]&#39;&#39; issues 22 and 23, wherein [[Bizarro]] is transported to an alternate reality somewhere in Hypertime which resembled the &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond]]&#39;&#39;-era [[Gotham City]], with &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; in action with the 1999 animated black-and-red costume and the 1992 [[Batplane]] from the original animated series. This version of the character is in radio contact with [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]], but was referred to as \&quot;Tim\&quot;. The &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; cameo was enough to garner a [[DC Direct]] action figure, the character&#39;s first in years, listed as \&quot;Tim Drake\&quot;.\n\nAlso, in &#39;&#39;[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39;, former [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] [[Jason Todd]], former [[Wonder Girl]] [[Donna Troy]], Green Lantern [[Kyle Rayner]], and [[Bob the Monitor]] travel to \&quot;[[Earth-12]],\&quot; which resembles the DCAU&#39;s future. They witness from the rooftops someone in a &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; costume defeating members of the Jokerz gang (although they do not know who is under the mask of the future Batman), to which Jason Todd says: \&quot;Huh. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\&quot; The group speculates that either Tim Drake or [[Dick Grayson]] is under the mask. However, The Monitor confirms it is indeed McGinnis.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Countdown to Final Crisis&#39;&#39; #21&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Dan DiDio]] announced in a July 2009 questions segment with Newsarama that Terry McGinnis would be appearing within DC Comics again in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/common/media/video/player.php?aid=29536 |title=Video: 20 Questions With Dan DiDio, July 2009, Part 2 |publisher=Newsarama |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]&#39;&#39; miniseries began its run on 16 June 2010, set in 2039 Neo-Gotham, revolving around the assassination of anyone who had anything to do with Bruce Wayne&#39;s Batman, foe or friend. Dan DiDio stated that this \&quot;Terry McGinnis mini-series\&quot; is in response to the interest expressed by the \&quot;fans of the character.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080924-Didio-20-questions.html |title=Newsarama by Vaneta Rogers: Monday, August 24, 2007 |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be penned by Adam Beechen, a [[The Batman (TV series)|non-DCAU Batman]] television writer. According to Beechen, the comic book arc will open the door for the \&quot;legendary\&quot; DCAU to enter into the mainstream DC Universe (comics), tying into both continuities. The series will take place after McGinnis had [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker|defeated the reborn Joker]] and pick up where Bruce Timm initially left off, but years before [[Batman Beyond#Project Batman Beyond|he learns that Bruce Wayne is his biological father]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ackley Design |url=http://www.bigshinyrobot.com/reviews/archives/12731 |title=Batman Beyond Returns! |publisher=Big Shiny Robot |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708001347/http://www.bigshinyrobot.com/reviews/archives/12731 |archive-date=2011-07-08 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=25300 |title=Beechen on \&quot;Batman Beyond\&quot; |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/adam-beechen-batman-beyond-100318.html |title=Adam Beechen on BATMAN BEYOND&#39;s Secret Story Arc Title |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn 2010, Terry appeared alongside Superman in the oversized issue &#39;&#39;Superman/Batman Annual 2010&#39;&#39;, where it picks up after [[Batman Beyond|their first meeting together]] taking place in the DCAU, and also jibing with the DCU.\n\nTerry became officially part of the [[DCU canon]] in &#39;&#39;Superman/Batman Annual&#39;&#39; #4. In \&quot;[[The New 52]]\&quot; reboot following the 2011 &#39;&#39;[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]&#39;&#39; comic book crossover, Terry made his debut in DC Comics&#39; latest continuity in 2014.&lt;ref name=New52/&gt;\n\nOn October 6, 2010, it was announced at New York Comic-Con that &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; would start as an ongoing series in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/10/06/nycc-2010-batman-beyond-goes-from-mini-to-ongoing-in-january/ |title=DC Universe: The Source \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb NYCC 2010: Batman Beyond Goes from Mini to Ongoing in January |publisher=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series ended with only eight issues in August. However, a new series titled &#39;&#39;&#39;Batman Beyond Unlimited&#39;&#39;&#39; will serve as a return to the Beyond universe. The title will feature &#39;&#39;&#39;Superman Beyond&#39;&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;&#39;Justice League Beyond&#39;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;&#39; starring McGinnis.\n\nTerry McGinnis officially entered mainstream DC continuity in the 2014 [[The New 52|New 52]] maxiseries, &#39;&#39;[[The New 52: Futures End]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=New52/&gt;\n\n==Relationships==\n===Bruce Wayne===\nDespite his role as the second Batman, Terry leads a very different, far less privileged life than Bruce. In addition to coping with his father&#39;s death, Terry struggles to keep his double life secret from his mother and younger brother. Because of his responsibilities as Batman and personal assistant to Bruce, he is not afforded the same licenses the Robins enjoyed and is expected to be on the call whenever he is needed. As a result, Terry is just barely successful at balancing out his dual life, on several occasions prompting both men to reconsider Terry&#39;s reliability. This is evidenced by him perpetually sleepy during the day, struggling to stay awake for school or to have time for his family and girlfriend.\n\nTerry and Bruce develop an unspoken respect for each other, with Terry regarding Bruce as a surrogate father, not knowing his biological connection to Bruce at first. This is demonstrated in the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Two: 1999\u20132000|Sneak Peek]]\&quot; where Terry pays reporter Ian Peek a visit to plead on Bruce&#39;s behalf:\n\n:&#39;&#39;&#39;Terry:&#39;&#39;&#39; \&quot;I don&#39;t care what you do to me, but he doesn&#39;t deserve this. He&#39;s done too much for this city to wind up in the middle of a media circus.\&quot;\n:&#39;&#39;&#39;Peek:&#39;&#39;&#39; \&quot;He means a lot to you, doesn&#39;t he?\&quot;\n:&#39;&#39;&#39;Terry:&#39;&#39;&#39; \&quot;Yes... he does.\&quot;\n\nEven though the stern attitude of Bruce with Terry is meant to ensure that he pushes Terry both emotionally and physically, and even though Bruce can at times be very emotionally distant to the young Batman, there are occasions where he also shows genuine concern and love for Terry. In one instance he defended Terry to Commissioner Barbara Gordon when Shriek held Gotham hostage in exchange for Batman&#39;s life:\n:&#39;&#39;&#39;Bruce:&#39;&#39;&#39; \&quot;What are you saying Barbara? That I should just hand Terry over to Shriek?\&quot;\n:&#39;&#39;&#39;Barbara:&#39;&#39;&#39; \&quot;No, give him to me. I&#39;ll figure out something. I had some pretty good teachers, remember?\&quot;\n:&#39;&#39;&#39;Bruce:&#39;&#39;&#39; \&quot;I remember, but you work for a mayor who would sell out the kid at the drop of a hat.\&quot;\n:&#39;&#39;&#39;Barbara:&#39;&#39;&#39; \&quot;Look, if you&#39;ve got a better plan...\&quot;\n:&#39;&#39;&#39;Bruce:&#39;&#39;&#39; \&quot;All I know right now is this: That kid&#39;s done a lot for this city, it&#39;s time the city did something for him.\&quot;\n\nIn turn, Bruce initially treats Terry the same way he treated [[Dick Grayson]] and [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]]. In time, Terry grows into the cowl, and Bruce grows to accept him as his heir to the Batman legacy, demonstrating a great deal of faith in him despite his criminal past; in the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Two: 1999\u20132000|Eyewitness]],\&quot; when Terry was framed by [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)#Spellbinder in Batman Beyond|Spellbinder]] for [[murder]], Bruce trusted Terry&#39;s claims of innocence even after [[Barbara Gordon]] told Bruce that she had seen Terry kill a man. Over time, the generally private Bruce Wayne even told Terry about some of his old enemies and adventures as Batman, such as his old relationship with [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]], with Terry also doing his own independent research into individuals such as [[Talia al Ghul]], although Bruce rarely discussed [[the Joker (comics)|the Joker]] due to the [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker|intensely personal nature of his confrontations with the villain]].\n\nThe &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]\&quot; reveals that Terry is secretly Bruce&#39;s biological youngest son (since [[Damian Wayne|Damian]], who was conceived via Bruce&#39;s tryst with [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]]) due to [[Amanda Waller]]&#39;s \&quot;Batman Beyond\&quot; project. The project caused [[List of Batman Beyond characters#Terry&#39;s Family|Warren McGinnis]] to have his [[DNA]] re-written into an exact copy of Bruce&#39;s when he had what he thought was a [[flu]] shot; this would make Bruce the biological father of Terry and his younger brother [[List of Batman Beyond characters#Terry&#39;s Family|Matt McGinnis]], even though they were born to [[Warren &amp; Mary McGinnis|Warren and Mary McGinnis]]. When Terry was eight years old, the same age Bruce lost his parents, Waller then hired assassin [[Andrea Beaumont]], AKA: The Phantasm, Bruce Wayne&#39;s former fianc\u00e9e, to kill Warren and Mary as they were coming out of a movie theater with their son, hoping to recreate the same psychological trauma that resulted in Bruce becoming Batman within Terry, but at the last minute Beaumont abandoned the job, believing it would go against everything Bruce stood for: this would eventually lead Waller to completely abort the project - however, Warren&#39;s death at the hands of a criminal ironically cemented Terry&#39;s destiny as the next Batman. This twist seems to be [[foreshadowing|foreshadowed]] in a number of &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; episodes, as references to Bruce being a father figure are occasionally made, both by Terry and other characters, as well as the similarities the two men share. Both of Terry&#39;s parents are shown as having red hair in &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;, which is usually a recessive trait, which would make it extremely unusual for them to have biological sons with black hair. Additionally, at the end of the episode \&quot;The Call\&quot;, Superman implied he knew of Terry&#39;s true lineage.\n\n===Family members===\nTerry values his mother, [[List of Batman Beyond characters#Terry&#39;s Family|Mary McGinnis]], and his younger brother, [[List of Batman Beyond characters#Terry&#39;s Family|Matt]], as the closest family he has left. At the time of his death, Warren McGinnis was [[divorce]]d from his wife and their sons split between them; Terry with his father, Matt with his mother. After the divorce, Terry&#39;s relationship with his father is shown in the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes|Rebirth]]\&quot; to be strained. The last time they spoke Terry and his father have a heated argument, something Terry is never completely able to forgive himself for (even after finding out that Warren was not his real father). Like Thomas Wayne, Warren&#39;s death inspired Terry to fight crime as Batman. After Warren&#39;s death, Terry moves back in with his mother and brother.\n\nEven though there exists an obligatory spark of [[sibling rivalry]] and [[tough love]] between himself and Matt, Terry would be there to raise his brother&#39;s spirits when he was feeling down, notably in the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Two: 1999\u20132000|Revenant]]\&quot; when Matt reminisces about their father. Matt is also an obsessive Batman fan, which is ironic considering that he never realizes his brother and the hero he idolizes are one and the same, and oblivious of his biological relation to the original Dark Knight.\n\nAs far as Mary and Matt are concerned, Terry is simply employed by Bruce Wayne to run errands during the series, finding the idea of Terry being Batman to be absurd, ridiculing him when he once attempts to reveal his secret in the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Two: 1999\u20132000|Sneak Peek]]\&quot;.\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;Justice League Unlimited&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Epilogue\&quot;, Terry tells Bruce Wayne that he never once doubted that Warren McGinnis loved him with all his heart, and would have taught Terry right from wrong if the young man had been willing to listen.\n\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC&#39;s continuity. In this new timeline, Matt McGinnis is aware of his brother&#39;s secret identity after Terry revealed it to him when he rescued Matt from a crumbling bridge. He becomes more active in assisting both Tim and Terry when they take on the mantle of Batman, and possibly hopes to inherit the mantle himself one day. However, in Rebirth, Matt became the new Robin instead. Their mother is also deceased as a result of &#39;&#39;Futures End&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;BBOct16\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; (vol. 6) #1 (October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Friends and colleagues===\n\n====Max Gibson====\n&#39;&#39;&#39;Maxine&#39;&#39;&#39; \&quot;&#39;&#39;&#39;Max&#39;&#39;&#39;\&quot; &#39;&#39;&#39;Gibson&#39;&#39;&#39;, a classmate of Terry&#39;s and later one of his closest friends, is an [[African American]] girl with short dyed pink hair who attends Hamilton Hill High School with Terry. Her parents are separated, and she has one older sister who often works late hours. Max is exceptionally intelligent and talented with [[computer programming]], even among her peers. It is revealed in the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Two: 1999\u20132000|Babel]]\&quot; that the Gibsons own a seal-pointed [[Siamese cat]].\n\nMax becomes curious about [[Batman]] after his \&quot;return\&quot; to [[Gotham City]]. Exceptionally skilled with [[computer]]s and [[electronics]], she creates a program that is designed to uncover Batman&#39;s [[secret identity]] to satisfy that curiosity. After unmasking Terry (following an incorrect assessment of him being a Jokerz hooligan), Max insists on being a part of his secret life and helps him with everything from [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]] to coming up with excuses to give his girlfriend [[#Dana Tan|Dana]]. She even expressed a desire to want to be the next Batgirl at some point, but both Bruce and Terry refused to allow that possibility to become a real one.\n\nMax&#39;s importance is similar to that of [[Barbara Gordon]]&#39;s in the comics, as the resident hacking genius. Terry and Max remain close, but their relationship is never shown to exceed the boundaries of friendship, which is in contrast to the relationship between Barbara and Bruce, who were briefly involved. Max is, essentially, Terry&#39;s version of [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; Terry even jokingly referred to her as such on one occasion.\n\nThe show has been revisited several times since its end, in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Static Shock]]&#39;&#39; and in the movie &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]&#39;&#39;, but Max has not been seen or mentioned in any of these. However, she has made an appearance in the fourth issue of the ongoing comic book series &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; and presently of the first issue of the current &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; series that was released as part of [[DC Rebirth]],&lt;ref name=\&quot;BBOct16\&quot; /&gt; which is part of a separate continuity that is part of the New 52 universe.\n\n=====Notable episodes=====\nIn the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Two: 1999\u20132000|Hidden Agenda]]\&quot;, Max reveals that she is writing a [[computer program]] to analyze all the data available on Batman and deduce his [[secret identity]]. She informs her friends Terry McGinnis and [[#Dana Tan|Dana Tan]] that she believes that Batman is a new person in the old suit, and is somehow connected to their school. This concerns Terry, who is in fact the new Batman.\n\nWhen the school is vandalized by a gang of [[Jokerz]], Max reconfigures her program to search for Jokerz instead. Unknown to her, the [[vandalism]] was targeted at her personally: the leader of the Jokerz, Terminal, is actually an honor student named Carter Wilson, and Max&#39;s standing is higher than his, outperforming him academically; at the current rate, she will be [[valedictorian]] instead of him.\n\nTerry, as Batman, discovers that Max is a specific target and mistakenly believes that it is because of her computer program. He convinces her to stop running the program, but when Max goes to delete it, she learns that it has completed its analysis. Much to her surprise, Terry&#39;s name comes up on the list of potential Jokerz, and she becomes convinced that Terry is Terminal and sends him a message, threatening to expose his secret if he does not meet her. Further confusing the issue, Terry does not get the message until late, and Terminal (who was following her) shows up at the meeting place with his Jokerz. Terry arrives as Batman and rescues Max, revealing Terminal&#39;s true identity in the process.\n\nMax later admits to Terry that she had thought he was one of the Jokerz, but has now figured out the truth. She goes to delete her program, but Terry advises her that it has already been wiped after Bruce hacked into the school&#39;s computer systems. Max then immediately proves herself an asset by providing an [[alibi]] for why Terry did not call Dana the previous night when he was saving Max. Max tells Terry that he cannot call her Robin; he instead jokingly calls her \&quot;[[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]]\&quot;. (Naturally, she fails to understand the reference, given Alfred&#39;s lack of exposure in Batman&#39;s exploits to the public).\n\nIn the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Two: 1999\u20132000|Hooked Up]]\&quot;, Max attempts to join Terry on patrol as his partner, even though both he and Bruce do not approve. Trying to prove her worth to Terry, she becomes addicted to [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)#Spellbinder in Batman Beyond|Spellbinder]]&#39;s illegal [[virtual reality|VR]] technology, but fights off its influence and knocks Spellbinder out before he can injure Terry. Although Terry remains unwilling to allow her to physically assist him, he accepts her as his partner after she helps him defeat [[Curar\u00e9 (Batman Beyond)|Curar\u00e9]] and disarming Mutro Botha&#39;s [[nuclear weapon]] in the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Two: 1999\u20132000|Final Cut]]\&quot;.\n\nTerry initially hides Bruce&#39;s identity from Max, but Max already has enough information to deduce that Terry&#39;s employer is actually the original Batman. In \&quot;Where&#39;s Terry?\&quot;, when Terry goes missing in [[Gotham City|Gotham]]&#39;s maze of subway tunnels, Bruce and Max look for him together and manage to come to an understanding regarding their respective importance to Terry, although Bruce steadfastly refuses to allow her to become involved in rescuing Terry.\n\n====Dana Tan====\nTerry flirted with several girls throughout the show, but his main love interest has always been &#39;&#39;&#39;Dana Tan&#39;&#39;&#39;, his long-time girlfriend. In the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Three: 2000\u20132001|Big Time]],\&quot; she recognizes Charlie \&quot;Big Time\&quot; Bigelow by sight, suggesting that Dana and Terry knew each other since their early teens, although in \&quot;Rebirth\&quot;, Terry&#39;s mother notes that Dana, Terry&#39;s \&quot;friend\&quot;, left him her number, suggesting that they became an item over the course of the series. Despite their commitment to each other, their relationship is strained as Terry struggles early on as Batman to balance his dual obligations. The two have been on the verge of breaking up several times, especially before Terry meets Melanie Walker, AKA Ten of the [[Royal Flush Gang]], but despite being close to breaking up several times over, Dana somehow manages to forgive Terry for his absences, believing that Terry sees Bruce Wayne as a father-figure and doesn&#39;t want to fail him. The two are usually shown together many times through the series, including the motion-picture movie &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]&#39;&#39;.\n\nHowever, as the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]\&quot; reveals, Terry ultimately grows into full acceptance of his role as Batman, and somewhere along the line discloses his secret to Dana. Despite knowing his secret, Dana shows to have accepted his double life and is willing to be with him, even if her safety is threatened. She is also frustrated with the fact that they have been dating for years and have not married. Although it takes him some time to get over his fears for her safety in the event that his identity is ever compromised, the episode ends with Terry planning to propose to her.\n\nIn the comics, it was revealed that Dana had a brother named Doug who led an assault on Gotham as the leader of the Jokerz. Dana requests Terry and Bruce&#39;s help in finding him, but Doug manages to kill thousands of people by sending a large group of Jokerz as suicide bombers around the city. Doug confronts Dana and her family in the hospital (after he fractured their father&#39;s skull), but before Doug can kill them, Bruce manages to call Batman in to save the Tans, eventually resulting in Doug&#39;s death. Batman&#39;s rescue led Dana to figure out that Terry was Batman and what his connection to Bruce was. Bruce and Terry trusted Dana enough to keep the secret, and Dana&#39;s family agrees to implant Bruce with Doug&#39;s liver to save Bruce from dying of liver failure.\n\n====Melanie Walker/Ten====\nIn the midst of a spat with Dana, Terry meets &#39;&#39;&#39;Melanie Walker&#39;&#39;&#39; and the two become extremely attracted to one another instantly; however, Terry is crushed when he learns she too leads a double life: as &#39;&#39;&#39;Ten&#39;&#39;&#39;, the youngest member of the latest incarnation of the [[Royal Flush Gang]]. He discards a note Melanie had left him without reading it, choosing to be with Dana instead in his anger due to the betrayal, leaving Melanie apparently oblivious that her enemy and her lover are the same person.\n\nTerry has additional encounters with Ten and the Royal Flush Gang; each time, he advises her to turn straight, showing that he still cares deeply about her. Their relationship is somewhat reminiscent of the one the original [[Batman]] had with [[Catwoman]], and Bruce even notes it. Melanie is later shown to have gone straight and has abandoned the life of a criminal for a normal one.\n\nIn a comic book series based from the continuity of the animated series, Melanie is now enrolled in Terry and Dana&#39;s college, continuing the love triangle between them. After Batman and Ten stop Inque and Queen from stealing [[Two-Face|Two-Face&#39;s]] coin, Terry accuses Melanie of stealing the coin, leading the two to break up as Melanie accepts that she can never get Terry to trust her again no matter what she does.\n\n====Commissioner Barbara Gordon====\nTerry upholds tradition by forging an alliance with [[Gotham City]]&#39;s [[police commissioner]], &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Barbara Gordon]]&#39;&#39;&#39;, formerly [[Batgirl]]/Oracle and the daughter of [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]. The alliance starts out on a sour note, as Barbara never fails to take Terry&#39;s juvenile record into account and believes he is too reckless for the role of Batman. The fact that Terry occasionally ruins police stakeout operations by intervening without fully assessing the situation sometimes worsens their relationship. In addition to this, Barbara, actually the last of the [[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Bat-Family]] to retire from vigilantism, revealed she and Bruce were romantically involved at one point, but his unwavering focus on his mission strained their relationship, thus having a new Batman appears to have opened up old wounds for her.\n\nBarbara is reluctant to assist the new Batman and to have a teenager as Gotham&#39;s new protector. The direct-to-video movie &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]&#39;&#39; revealed that Barbara remains haunted by the [[torture]] that [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] long ago suffered at the hands of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]. She advises Terry to give up being Batman, and once tries to arrest him after he is framed for murder by [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)#Spellbinder in Batman Beyond|Spellbinder]]; however, when the truth comes out, Barbara rewards Terry with a civic service award as an apology. Barbara eventually relents, however, upon realizing that she could not deter him any more than she could have been deterred from being Batgirl.\n\nBarbara eventually warms up to Terry, assisting him when Bruce is put out of action by a revived Joker. She states that she hopes Terry would avoid the lonely existence that Bruce leads. However, Barbara&#39;s attitude is different from Jim Gordon&#39;s, and she notes once that she is \&quot;not [her] father\&quot;, never working as closely with Terry as her father did with Bruce (i.e. using a [[Bat-Signal]], directly giving him leads, etc.).\n\nIn the comics, Barbara works closer with Terry than in the animated series and gives him the necessary information about the criminals they face. She even gives him the opportunity to take the villains down before calling in for police support. She becomes more involved when Terry starts working with her former lover, Dick Grayson. At one point, she and Dick tell Terry that her relationship with Bruce went to shambles because Barbara was seeing both at the same time, while keeping her affair with Bruce secret from Dick. Eventually, this reached the breaking point when Barbara became pregnant from Bruce, who then decided to tell Dick without gaining her consent. Because Barbara would not relent from crimefighting, she suffered a miscarriage, all of which resulted in the bitter end of her participation as a member of the [[Bat-Family]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman Beyond 2.0&#39;&#39; #27 (August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn 2011&#39;s &#39;&#39;New 52&#39;&#39; reboot of the series, Barbara is slightly younger than she was in the animated series (still retaining her red hair) and isn&#39;t hesitant to work with Terry likely due to the extreme circumstances the world was put in thanks to &#39;&#39;Futures End&#39;&#39;. When Terry was presumed dead and Tim Drake was Batman, her role as the tech expert was similar to Bruce&#39;s role to Terry&#39;s Batman.\n\n====Dick Grayson====\nThough Terry never met Batman&#39;s former sidekick that was [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and [[Nightwing]] in the animated series, the two did get the chance to meet in the tie-in comic. They work together to bring down Hush (who was a failed clone of Grayson), and Dick helped Terry with handling the Jokerz bombing Gotham and Undercloud. Though Dick was uninvolved in the superhero community for quite some time after losing his eye during a fight between Batman and the Joker, Terry has inspired him to return to the spotlight. When a GCPD detective outs Dick as Nightwing to the public, Terry and Max try to make the public think otherwise by having Terry interrogate the detective as a disguised, older Nightwing while Max plants alibis on the internet. Dick admits the truth to the public without jeopardizing his allies&#39; secrets.\n\nAfter learning how Bruce impacted Dick and Barbara&#39;s romance, Terry loses trust in Bruce and chooses Dick to be his new mentor. Terry finds working with Dick easier than Bruce, Dick reminds Terry of his commitment to his family and to his education.\n\nTerry also managed to convince the Justice Lord counterpart of Dick to aid him in battling Lord Superman. After Lord Superman is defeated, Dick and Terry&#39;s counterpart are inspired by Terry to continue Bruce&#39;s legacy and begin their version of Batman Beyond. Dick becomes T&#39;s mentor for fighting criminals.\n\n====T====\nT is Terry&#39;s counterpart in the [[Justice Lords]] timeline. In this timeline, Terry became estranged from his parents (his father is alive in this reality), dyed his hair blond, and became a member of the Jokerz. He was also dating the Justice Lord counterpart of Melanie, who was also part of the Jokerz.\n\nWhen Terry arrives in his reality in the &#39;&#39;Justice Lords Beyond&#39;&#39; story arc, he is disgusted by T&#39;s personality and actions as a Joker. He&#39;s also upset that T is distant from his parents and doesn&#39;t take advantage of his dad being alive in this reality. In the event, Terry&#39;s near-sacrifice at the hands of Lord Superman and courage convince T to turn his life around. T and this reality&#39;s Dick Grayson assist Terry in escaping and taking on Lord Superman. When Lord Superman is defeated, T gives Terry the chance to talk to his father in return for his actions. T and Dick are inspired by Terry to continue Batman&#39;s legacy and he becomes this reality&#39;s version of Batman Beyond.\n\nFollowing this, Terry makes frequent visits to the timeline to monitor T&#39;s journey as a hero and becomes increasingly impressed with T&#39;s progress. He also takes the time to make visits with T&#39;s dad. However, when Rewire blackmails Batman into giving him access to the Justice Lords timeline, Bruce destroys the portal. T and the alternate Dick make one last visit over where T tells Terry that he told his father about his situation and that he wants to see both of them. However, Terry&#39;s accepted that T&#39;s father will never be his and decides not to go back to their timeline again. He tells T to spend time with his loved ones before they are gone and gives one last goodbye before T and Dick return to their timeline.\n\n====Charlie Bigelow====\n&#39;&#39;&#39;Charlie \&quot;Big Time\&quot; Bigelow&#39;&#39;&#39; is a [[Confidence trick|con artist]] who dragged Terry into a life of crime. In the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Three: 2000\u20132001|Big Time]],\&quot; Terry reveals his background with Charlie to Max, explaining that the same felony which landed him in juvie for three months had Charlie put away for three years. Guilt-ridden, Terry would e-mail Charlie periodically while he was in prison. When Charlie is finally released, Terry convinces Bruce to give him a job at Wayne-Powers. This turns out to be a ploy by Charlie to aid in a corporate espionage scheme, during which Charlie is exposed to an experimental growth compound and mutated into a monstrous, disproportionate creature.\n\nDespite Terry&#39;s friendship with Bigelow and the regret that his time in jail did not reform him, subsequent events in the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Three: 2000\u20132001|Betrayal]]\&quot; make clear that Bigelow saw Terry merely as hired muscle. Terry finally lets go of his guilt toward Charlie and sees him for the monster he really is. Terry and Charlie&#39;s friendship is reminiscent of Bruce and [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]], two best friends who eventually become enemies, another similarity that Bruce notes.\n\n===With other superheroes===\nTerry grew up admiring other superheroes of his day, the [[Justice League|Justice League Unlimited]]. Eventually, he is recruited by [[Superman]] to root out a traitor in the team, which turns out to be Superman himself, under the control of the [[Fictional extraterrestrials|extraterrestrial]] creature [[Starro]]. Though the rest of the team at first distrusts him due to his perceived inexperience, Terry gains their trust by saving their lives and freeing Superman from the alien&#39;s [[mind control]]. However, he says that he would prefer to be like his mentor and only partially serve on the Justice League.\n\nWhen [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] is sent 40 years into the future from the time of the &#39;&#39;[[Static Shock]]&#39;&#39; series, he is forced to work with Terry to rescue Static&#39;s future self from the [[Kobra (DC comics)|KOBRA]] organization. While Terry doubts his abilities at first, he eventually develops respect for Static. Terry also sees the resemblance in both the teenage and adult version.\n\nTerry seems to have rejoined, as later episodes of &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; show him as a regular member (and possibly leader). In the alternate timeline shown in the JLU episode \&quot;The Once and Future Thing, Part 2: Time Warped,\&quot; Terry fights alongside Static (of that era) and Warhawk. He is killed in the episode, though his death is undone thanks to [[time travel]].\n\n==Powers, abilities, and equipment==\nEven prior to receiving training from Bruce, Terry appeared to be at least a well abled [[Street fighting|street fighter]]. In the pilot episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes|Rebirth]]\&quot;, he is able to fend off a number of [[Jokerz]] without aid, and appears to be a member of his high school&#39;s [[wrestling]] team. As expected of Batman, he engages in regular, rigorous training to minimize his reliance on the [[Batsuit]]: under Bruce&#39;s tutelage, Terry has honed his body to at least [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] levels.\n\nTerry has engaged in combat outside of the Batsuit in various instances. His training has granted him exceptional reflexes, enabling him to evade gunfire and make impressive leaping attempts whether in or out of the Batsuit. In one instance, without the suit&#39;s aid, Terry survives a fall from several stories high by bouncing off a pillar that is about to crush him and lands on his feet. Terry even defeats his suit in single combat when it is controlled by the computerized consciousness of a deceased business mogul, armed only with the equipment in [[Batman&#39;s utility belt|Bruce&#39;s vintage utility belt]]. Fifteen years after the last episode of &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond]]&#39;&#39;, as Terry reaches his thirties, he is able to get through [[Amanda Waller]]&#39;s security systems and overpower her guards without the aid of his suit, suggesting that his skills are rivaling his mentor&#39;s when he was in his prime.\n\nIn \&quot;[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]\&quot;, Waller comments that Terry has inherited several of Bruce&#39;s qualities: he possesses a high [[wikt:intellect|intellect]] (though Waller notes that Bruce is still the brighter of the pair) and has grown into Bruce&#39;s physical stature and build, having been significantly leaner than Bruce was as Batman during the series. Terry tends to rely on Bruce for the intellectual details when in the field, but he has received an amount of [[detective]] training from Bruce, allowing him to perform such feats as tracking down Shriek or determining a connection between Joker and Tim Drake when Bruce was incapacitated. Despite his detective training, Terry&#39;s ambition is to be a [[physician]], and, under Bruce, he learns to create cures, remedies and antidotes. As a student, his main interests are in health or medical sciences and history; however, his responsibilities as Batman and less-than-stellar study habits have caused problems with his grades, as seen in \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Two: 1999\u20132000|The Eggbaby]]\&quot; where he needed to get a good grade on a Family Studies practical assignment in order to pass the class.\n\nAs Batman, Terry emulates Bruce&#39;s deep, harsh tone. He does this of his own accord, to separate the entities of Terry and Batman (Terry can be heard using his \&quot;Batman voice\&quot; outside of the Batsuit in the episodes \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season One: 1999|Shriek]]\&quot; and \&quot;[[List of Static Shock episodes#Season 4: 2004|Future Shock]]\&quot;). Actor [[Will Friedle]] has stated that he believes Terry&#39;s \&quot;Batman voice\&quot; is not just to strike terror into the hearts of criminals, but also to conceal his adolescence.\n\nTerry has a tendency to taunt his opponents: on one occasion, he was able to put the revived Joker off-balance to the point of blind anger. Terry is also capable of using a rather convincing [[Brooklyn accent]] when undercover (\&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season One: 1999|Shriek]],\&quot; \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season Two: 1999\u20132000|Ace in the Hole]]\&quot;). Terry is a skilled motorcyclist, seen hijacking a Jokerz motorcycle in \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season One: 1999|Rebirth]]\&quot; and using it throughout the series, and has also demonstrated considerable skill in handling a flight-capable [[Batmobile]].\n\n===Terry&#39;s Batsuit===\n[[File:Batsuit (Batman Beyond).jpg|left|thumb|120px|Terry&#39;s [[Batsuit]].]]\nThe [[Batsuit]] worn by Terry is the last incarnation created by Bruce before his retirement. Though the technology in the suit is at least 20 years old, it is still considered cutting-edge. In addition, after Terry becomes Batman, it is implied that the suit is updated numerous times, and after it is destroyed, he and Wayne are seen rebuilding and modifying it. The cowl in this suit covers the face completely, with the mouth being the only opening. The traditional cape has been eliminated in favour of retractable [[gliding flight|glider]] [[Wingsuit|wings]] under the arms. Thrusters built into the boots allow flight in the absence of wind, although for prolonged long-range flight Terry typically uses the Batmobile. In case the suit is stolen, [[Kill switch|the circuitry in the suit can be paralyzed remotely]] from the [[Batcave]].\n\nThis Batsuit [[Compression garment|conforms to the size and physique of its wearer]], being able to fit both the physically imposing Bruce and the significantly slimmer Terry. The [[form-fitting]] material provides almost no reduction in flexibility, while muscular enhancement technology enhances the wearer&#39;s strength and also grants the wearer agility and endurance. The material in the suit is resistant to massive concussive forces (in particular, it was able to take blows from [[Superman]]), [[fire]], [[laser]]s, [[Electrical injury|electric shocks]], [[Pressure|water pressure]], wind force, [[bullet]]s and even low levels of [[radiation]]. After an episode where Terry nearly drowns, a built-in [[rebreather]] is added to allow the user to remain underwater for long periods or breathe in other inhospitable areas.\n\nThe suit possesses a two-way audio-visual link with the Batcomputer, allowing Terry to keep in contact with Bruce for superior tactical planning. The same applies to the Batmobile, which will automatically fly to the user&#39;s location when summoned. Directional [[microphone]]s in the fingertips allow the user to hear and record audio through walls or at a distance - this data can then be transferred to a separate [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] as evidence. Lenses in the cowl&#39;s eyepieces transmit visual data to the wearer, allow for various scanning abilities and allow Wayne to monitor Terry&#39;s activities from the Batcave, seeing and hearing what he sees and hears and advising him. The cowl&#39;s lenses can also scan a number of frequencies in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] allowing [[night vision]] among other things. However, as the suit&#39;s visual capabilities are entirely electronic, the user is effectively rendered blind if they are disrupted.\n\nThe suit has several defensive capabilities. A device on the belt can [[electric field|electrically charge the suit]] to repel close attackers, added after Terry&#39;s encounters with the [[shapeshifting]] supervillain [[Inque]]; this same feature can be [[electroshock weapon|limited to just the hands]], turning the defensive technology into an offensive one if need be. The suit (and the Batmobile) also possesses a [[cloaking device]] that can render Terry invisible to the naked eye - although it cannot, however, filter [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]]. Pads on the feet can be [[magnet]]ically charged, allowing the user to cling to metal surfaces even when upside-down.\n\nThe suit&#39;s offensive capabilities are also significant. It carries a large number of dispensable [[Batarang]]s which, when inactive, are compact enough to be invisible to the naked eye. These Batarangs come with a range of auxiliary functions, such as producing electric shocks or explosions. The Batarangs are usually thrown by hand, but can be fired from a wrist-mounted launcher (which also fires its own \&quot;Dark Knight Discuses\&quot; in [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (video game)|the game]]). However, there is a limit to the amount of Batarangs the Batsuit can dispense; Batman has run out on at least one occasion. [[Batman&#39;s utility belt|The utility belt]] is integrated into the suit and carries tracers, [[Flashbang grenade|flash and]] [[Smoke grenade|smoke pellets]], [[Fire retardant|extinguisher capsules]], [[plastic handcuffs|flexicuffs]] and a detachable [[circular saw|buzz saw]] on the buckle. Retractable claws on the fingers can be used to cut through objects and grip solid surfaces and the forearms are equipped with [[grappling hook]]s that can act as [[bolas]].\n\nFinally, the Batsuit possesses a number of other devices to aid in detective work. The right index finger possesses a retractable decoding device for electronic locks, the palms possess [[polygraph]] sensors, and the fingers can analyze most substances they are dipped into. Other, less-used devices, such as frequency scanners, also make appearances.\n\n===Prototype Batsuit===\nIn the later comics, when Terry&#39;s suit was heavily damaged Bruce gave him a spare prototype Batsuit to join the Justice League on a mission. The most notable feature was a cape, and while the suit gave him identical physical abilities, its sensors and communication capabilities were less advanced.\n\n===Lord Batman&#39;s Synthetic Kryptonite Batsuit===\n&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Lord Batman Beyond.jpg|Lord Batman Beyond.|200px|thumb|right]] --&gt;\nWhile on a mission into the parallel universe where the [[Justice Lords]] reside, Terry found an alternate version of his Batsuit (hidden in the compartment where Bruce kept the prototype suit) built by Lord Batman before his death to counter Lord Superman&#39;s powers and abilities, the extra enhancements included force fields, holographic projections, and it featured synthetic kryptonite as a weapon. After defeating Lord Superman, he and Dick Grayson started upgrading his own suit with the enhancements. The upgrades include a new pair of wings on Terry&#39;s Batsuit to help him gain better capability in flight, but Bruce rejects the new wings.\n\n===The Bat Armor===\nSeen only twice in the series, the Bat Armor is donned by Bruce in an encounter with [[Inque]], who had kidnapped Terry and was holding him hostage. It is a retractable [[powered exoskeleton]] composed of heavy plate armor that enhances the survivability of the wearer, boosting their physical strength and resilience to superhuman levels greater than that of the Batsuit. When retracted, Bruce was able to wear a [[trench coat]] over it and not look like he had any considerable increase in body mass, although activating the armor shredded the trench coat in the process.\n\nBruce created the Bat Armor years earlier in light of his increasing heart problems as a possible replacement for the Batsuit; however, during testing, using the armor nearly gave him a [[heart attack]] and he was forced to abandon that option. Understandably, Bruce only uses the Bat Armor in dire circumstances.\n\nThis armor is featured in the episode \&quot;[[List of Batman Beyond episodes#Season One: 1999|Disappearing Inque]]\&quot;.\n\n==In other media==\n\n{{Update|section|date=June 2014}}\n\n[[File:Superman-batman22 batmanbeyond.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Terry and [[Bizarro]].]]\n\n===DCAU tie-in comics===\nIn addition to having his own ongoing [[comic book]], the Tomorrow Knight made an appearance in &#39;&#39;Superman Adventures&#39;&#39; #64, chasing a futuristic version of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]].\n\n===Television===\n*McGinnis has made a guest appearance on the &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series &#39;&#39;[[The Zeta Project]]&#39;&#39;. He also appeared on &#39;&#39;[[Static Shock]]&#39;&#39; in the episode \&quot;&#39;&#39;&#39;Future Shock&#39;&#39;&#39;,\&quot; which involved [[time travel]] and a future [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]]. McGinnis later appears in three episodes of &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39;; \&quot;The Once and Future Thing, Part 1: Weird Western Tales\&quot; (at the very end), \&quot;The Once and Future Thing, Part 2: Time Warped,\&quot; alongside Static and Warhawk. (He is apparently killed in the episode by Dee Dee using their energy whips, though his death is undone later, as the episode&#39;s plot involved [[time travel]].) After the timeline is fixed and Terry&#39;s death is prevented, Terry is seen 15 years older in the &#39;&#39;JLU&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;&#39;&#39;&#39;[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]]&#39;&#39;&#39;,\&quot; which is centered on him and takes place in his timeline, serving as the [[series finale]] to &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;.\n*McGinnis made his return to television since \&quot;Epilogue\&quot; to the &#39;&#39;[[DC Nation Shorts]]&#39;&#39; adaptation of &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; during the 75th-anniversary celebration for Batman.\n*A wallpaper of McGinnis as Batman is shown in Nightwing&#39;s house in the animated series, &#39;&#39;[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]&#39;&#39;, although he makes no physical appearance.\n\n===Video games===\n*Terry&#39;s advanced outfit has been featured as downloadable or pre-order bonus content in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham City]]&#39;&#39; and in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]&#39;&#39; as a secondary variant outfit. It&#39;s also available in &#39;&#39;[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]&#39;&#39;. The costume is also available for avatar use on [[Xbox Live]].\n*Terry McGinnis appears via downloadable content as a playable character in &#39;&#39;[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Troy Baker]].\n*&#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (video game)|Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]&#39;&#39; for Game Boy Color, PlayStation and Nintendo 64 followed [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker|the movie of the same name]].\n\n==See also==\n* &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond]]&#39;&#39;\n* &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]&#39;&#39;\n* [[Batman Beyond (comics)|&#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; (comics)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [[Dorling Kindersley|DK Publishing]]. &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond: The Animated Series Guide&#39;&#39;\n* [http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/beyond/bios/batman/ Terry McGinnis&#39; bio at The World&#39;s Finest]\n* {{dcauw|Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.dcauresource.com/profiles/good/b/batmanbeyond.php|publisher=dcauresource.com|title=DCAUResource.com: DCAU - Heroes - Batman(Beyond)|accessdate=2016-11-24}}\n\n{{DC Animated Universe}}\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{Justice League}}\n{{Batman family tree}}\n{{Portal bar|Speculative fiction|Cartoon|1990s}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Batman (Terry Mcginnis)}}\n[[Category:Batman Beyond characters]]\n[[Category:Batman characters]]\n[[Category:Animated characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bruce Timm]]\n[[Category:DC Animated Universe characters]]\n[[Category:DC Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:DC Comics child superheroes]]\n[[Category:DC Comics male superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from parallel universes]]\n[[Category:Fictional bodyguards]]\n[[Category:Fictional detectives]]\n[[Category:Fictional gang members]]\n[[Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional valets]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Animated human characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animated series]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in comics]]&quot;</span>
