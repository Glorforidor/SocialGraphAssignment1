He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked [[vigilante]] who defends the [[commoner]]s and [[indigenous peoples of California]] against corrupt and tyrannical officials and other villains. His signature all-black [[costume]] includes a cape, a hat known as a {{lang|es|[[sombrero cordob\u00e9s]]}}, and a mask covering the upper half of his face.\n\nIn the stories, Zorro has a high [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on his head, but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch, and he also delights in publicly humiliating them. Because of this, the townspeople started calling him &#39;&#39;\&quot;El Zorro\&quot;&#39;&#39; due to his foxlike cunning and charm. Zorro is an [[acrobat]] and an expert in various weapons, but the one he employs most frequently is his [[rapier]], which he uses often to carve the initial \&quot;Z\&quot; on his defeated foes, and other objects to \&quot;sign his work\&quot;. He is also an accomplished rider, his trusty steed being a black horse called [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]].\n\nZorro is the [[secret identity]] of &#39;&#39;&#39;Don Diego de la Vega&#39;&#39;&#39; (originally &#39;&#39;&#39;Don Diego Vega&#39;&#39;&#39;), a young man who is the only son of Don Alejandro de la Vega, the richest landowner in California, while Diego&#39;s mother is dead. In most versions, Diego learned his swordsmanship while at university in [[Spain]], and created his masked alter ego after he was unexpectedly summoned home by his father because California had fallen into the hands of an oppressive dictator. Diego is usually shown living with his father in a huge {{lang|es|[[hacienda]]}}, which contains a number of secret passages and tunnels, leading to a secret cave sometimes called \&quot;the Fox Den\&quot; that serves as headquarters for Zorro&#39;s operations and as Tornado&#39;s hiding place. In order to divert suspicion about his identity, Diego hides his fighting abilities while also pretending to be a coward and a [[fop]].\n\nZorro made his debut in the 1919 novel &#39;&#39;[[The Curse of Capistrano]]&#39;&#39;, originally meant as a stand-alone story. However, the success of the 1920 film adaptation &#39;&#39;[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]&#39;&#39; starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]] convinced McCulley to write more Zorro stories for about four decades: the character was featured in a total of five serialized stories and 57 short stories, the last one appearing in print posthumously in 1959, the year after his death. &#39;&#39;The Curse of Capistrano&#39;&#39; eventually sold more than 50 million copies, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books]] of all time. While the rest of McCulley&#39;s Zorro stories did not enjoy the same popularity, as most of them were never reprinted until the 21st century, the character also appears in over 40 films and in ten TV series, the most famous being the Disney-produced &#39;&#39;[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]&#39;&#39; series of 1957\u20131959, starring [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]]. Other media featuring Zorro include stories by other authors, audio/radio dramas, comic books and strips, stage productions and video games.\n\nBeing one of the earliest examples of a fictional masked avenger with a double identity, Zorro inspired the creation of several similar characters in pulp magazines and other media, and is a precursor of the [[superheroes]] of American comic books, with [[Batman]] drawing particularly close parallels to the character.\n\n== Publishing history ==\n[[File:Capistrano2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Zorro&#39;s debut in the novel &#39;&#39;[[The Curse of Capistrano]]&#39;&#39; (1919).]]\nZorro debuted in [[Johnston McCulley]]&#39;s novel &#39;&#39;[[The Curse of Capistrano]]&#39;&#39;, serialized in five parts between August 9 and September 6, 1919 in the [[pulp magazine]] &#39;&#39;[[All-Story Weekly]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beale|first1=Lewis|title=Zorro still makes his mark|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/28/entertainment/et-zorro28|accessdate=October 18, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was originally meant as a standalone tale, and at the [[denouement]], Zorro&#39;s true identity is revealed to all.\n\n[[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Mary Pickford]], on their [[honeymoon]], selected the story as the inaugural picture for their new studio, [[United Artists]], beginning the character&#39;s cinematic tradition.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The novel was adapted as the film &#39;&#39;[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]&#39;&#39; (1920), which Fairbanks produced, co-wrote and starred in as Diego/Zorro. The movie was a commercial success,&lt;ref name=lat /&gt; and the 1924 reprint of McCulley&#39;s story by publisher [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] used the same title, capitalizing on the movie&#39;s popularity. The novel has since been reprinted using both titles.\n\nIn response to public demand fueled by the film, McCulley wrote more than sixty more Zorro stories, beginning in 1922 with &#39;&#39;The Further Adventures of Zorro&#39;&#39;, which was also serialized in &#39;&#39;Argosy All-Story Weekly&#39;&#39;. Fairbanks picked up the movie rights for the sequel that year. However, Fairbanks&#39;s sequel, &#39;&#39;[[Don Q, Son of Zorro]]&#39;&#39; (1925), was more based on the 1919 novel &#39;&#39;Don Q&#39;s Love Story&#39;&#39; by the mother\u2013son duo Kate Prichard and [[Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard]], than &#39;&#39;The Further Adventures&#39;&#39;. Thus McCulley received no credit on the film.&lt;ref name=ths&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Stuart|title=The Hollywood Sequel: History &amp; Form, 1911\u20132010|date=2014|publisher=British Film Institute|isbn=978-1-84457-843-6|page=23 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jtYtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=The+Further+Adventures+of+Zorro+(1922)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TayFQci5_O&amp;sig=t3lBdIeEx3syvLEVBUM7BA9jH0I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8xIOAgPvWAhWhz4MKHddhCBw4ChDoAQhNMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Further%20Adventures%20of%20Zorro%20(1922)&amp;f=false |accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAt first, production of new Zorro stories proceeded at irregular intervals: the third novel, &#39;&#39;Zorro Rides Again&#39;&#39; (not to be confused with the 1937 theatrical serial) was published in 1931, nine years after the second one. Then, between 1932 and 1941, McCulley wrote four short stories and two serialized novels. Zorro stories were published much more frequently between 1944 and 1951, a period in which McCulley published 52 short stories with the character for the &#39;&#39;West Magazine&#39;&#39;. \&quot;Zorro Rides the Trail!\&quot;, which appeared in &#39;&#39;Max Brand&#39;s Western Magazine&#39;&#39; in 1954, is the last story to be published during the author&#39;s lifetime, and the second-to-last story overall. The last, \&quot;The Mask of Zorro\&quot; (not to be confused with the 1998 film), was published posthumously in &#39;&#39;Short Stories for Men&#39;&#39; in 1959. These stories [[Retroactive continuity|ignore]] Zorro&#39;s public revelation of his identity.\n\n&#39;&#39;The Curse of Capistrano&#39;&#39; eventually sold more than 50 million copies, becoming [[List of best-selling books|one of the best-selling books of all time]]. For the most part, McCulley&#39;s other Zorro stories remained overlooked and out-of-print until the 21st century. [http://www.boldventurepress.com Bold Venture Press] collected all McCulley&#39;s Zorro stories &#39;&#39;Zorro: The Complete Pulp Adventures&#39;&#39;, in six volumes.\n\nOver 40 Zorro titled films were made over the years, including &#39;&#39;[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]&#39;&#39;, the 1940 classic starring [[Tyrone Power]]. The character was also featured in ten TV series, the most famous being the Disney-produced &#39;&#39;[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]&#39;&#39; series of 1957\u2013&#39;59, starring [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]].&lt;ref name=lat /&gt; Zorro appears in several stories written by other authors, comics books and strips, stage productions, video games and other media. McCulley died in 1958, just as Zorro was at the height of his popularity thanks to the Disney series.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:The Mark of Zorro (1920) - 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Douglas Fairbanks]] in the first Zorro film, &#39;&#39;[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]&#39;&#39; (1920), which was instrumental in the early success of the character]]\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[The Curse of Capistrano]],&#39;&#39; Se\u00f1or Zorro became an outlaw in the [[Pueblo de Los Angeles|pueblo of Los Angeles]] in [[California]] \&quot;to avenge the helpless, to punish cruel politicians, to aid the oppressed\&quot; and is dubbed the \&quot;Curse of Capistrano\&quot;. The novel features extensively both Don Diego Vega and Zorro, but the fact that they are the same person is not revealed to the reader until the end of the book. In the story, both Diego and Zorro romance Lolita Pulido, an impoverished noblewoman. While Lolita is unimpressed with Diego, who pretends to be a passionless [[fop]], she is attracted to the dashing Zorro. The main villain is Captain Ramon, who also has his eyes on Lolita. Other characters include Sgt. Pedro Gonzales, Zorro&#39;s enemy but Diego&#39;s friend; Diego&#39;s deaf and mute servant Bernardo; his ally, Fray (Friar) Felipe; his father Don Alejandro Vega, the richest landowner in California and a widower; Don Carlos Pulido and his wife, Do\u00f1a Catalina, Lolita&#39;s parents; and a group of noblemen ({{lang|es|caballeros}}) who, at first, hunt Zorro but are then won over to his cause.\n\nIn later stories, McCulley introduces characters such as pirates and Native Americans, some of whom know Zorro&#39;s identity.\n\nIn McCulley&#39;s later stories, Diego&#39;s surname became de la Vega. In fact, the writer was wildly inconsistent. The first magazine serial ended with the villain dead and Diego publicly exposed as Zorro. But in the sequel, the villain was alive and the next entry had the double identity still secret.\n\nSeveral Zorro productions have expanded on the character&#39;s exploits. Many of the continuations feature a younger character taking up the mantle of Zorro.\n\nMcCulley&#39;s stories are set during the era of [[History of California#Spanish colonial period (1769\u20131821)|Spanish California]] (1769\u20131821)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Zorro.htm|title=The Legacy of the Fox:A Chronology of Zorro | publisher=|date= |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, although exact years are often vague, the presence of the Pueblo of Los Angeles means the stories cannot happen before 1781, the year it was founded. Some media adaptations of Zorro&#39;s story have placed him during the later era of [[History of California#Mexican period (1821 to 1846)|Mexican California]] (1821\u20131848).\n\n==Character motifs==\n[[File:Zorroandbernardo.jpg|thumb|left|Zorro ([[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]]) and Bernardo ([[Gene Sheldon]]) in [[Walt Disney]]&#39;s 1957\u20131959 &#39;&#39;[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]&#39;&#39; television series]]\n\nThe character&#39;s visual motif is typically a black costume with a black flowing Spanish cape or cloak, a black flat-brimmed hat known as [[sombrero cordob\u00e9s]], and a black sackcloth [[mask]] that covers the top half of his head. Sometimes the mask is a two piece, the main item being a blindfold-type fabric with slits for the eyes, and the other item being a bandana over the head, so that it is covered even if the hat is removed: this is the mask worn in the movie &#39;&#39;[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]&#39;&#39; (1920) and in the television series &#39;&#39;[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]&#39;&#39; (1957\u20131959). Other times, the mask is a one piece that unites both items described above: this mask was introduced in &#39;&#39;[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]&#39;&#39; (1940) and appears in many modern versions. Zorro&#39;s mask has also occasionally been shown as being a rounded [[domino mask]], which he wore without also wearing a bandana. In his first appearance, Zorro&#39;s cloak is purple, his hat is generically referred to as a \&quot;wide sombrero,\&quot; and his black cloth veil mask with slits for eyes covers his whole face. Other features of the costume may vary.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nHis favored weapon is a [[rapier]], which he also uses to often leave his distinctive mark, a Z cut with three quick strokes, on his defeated foes and other objects to \&quot;sign his work\&quot;. He also uses other weapons, including a [[bullwhip]] and a [[pistol]].\n\nThe [[fox]] is never depicted as Zorro&#39;s emblem. It is used as a metaphor for the character&#39;s wiliness, such as in the lyrics \&quot;Zorro, &#39;the Fox&#39;, so cunning and free{{nbsp}}...\&quot; from [[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Disney&#39;s television series]] theme.\n\nHis heroic pose consists of rearing on his horse, [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]], often saluting with his hand or raising his sword high. The logo of the company Zorro Productions, Inc. uses an image of Zorro rearing on his horse, sword raised high.\n\n==Skills and resources==\n[[File:Zorroridesagain.jpg|thumb|Poster for the serial &#39;&#39;[[Zorro Rides Again]]&#39;&#39; (1937), starring [[John Carroll (actor)|John Carroll]] as a descendant of the original Zorro]]\nZorro is an agile athlete and [[acrobat]], using his bullwhip as a gymnastic accoutrement to swing through gaps between city roofs, and is very capable of landing from great heights and taking a fall. Although he is a master swordsman and marksman, he has more than once demonstrated his prowess in unarmed combat against multiple opponents.\n\nHis calculating and precise dexterity as a tactician has enabled him to use his two main weapons, his sword and bullwhip, as an extension of his deft hand. He never uses brute strength. Instead and more likely, he uses his fox-like and sly mind, and well-practiced technique to outmatch an opponent.\n\nIn some versions, Zorro keeps a medium-sized dagger tucked in his left boot for emergencies. He has used his cape as a blind, a trip-mat and a disarming tool. Zorro&#39;s boots are also sometimes weighted, as is his hat, which he has thrown, Frisbee-style, as an efficiently substantial warning to enemies. But more often than not, he uses psychological mockery to make his opponents too angry to be coordinated in combat.\n\nZorro is a skilled horseman. The name of his jet-black horse has varied through the years. In &#39;&#39;The Curse of Capistrano&#39;&#39;, it was unnamed. In Disney&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]&#39;&#39; television series the horse gets the name [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]], which has been kept in many later adaptations. In most versions, Zorro keeps Tornado in a secret cave, connected to his {{lang|es|[[hacienda]]}} with a system of secret passages and tunnels.\n\nMcCulley&#39;s concept of a band of men helping Zorro is often absent from other versions of the character. An exception is &#39;&#39;[[Zorro&#39;s Fighting Legion]]&#39;&#39; (1939), starring [[Reed Hadley]] as Diego. In Douglas Fairbanks&#39; version, he also has a band of masked men helping him. In McCulley&#39;s stories, Zorro was aided by a deaf-mute named Bernardo. In Disney&#39;s &#39;&#39;Zorro&#39;&#39; television series, Bernardo is not deaf but pretends to be, and serves as Zorro&#39;s secret agent. He is a capable and invaluable helper for Zorro, sometimes wearing the mask to reinforce his master&#39;s charade. [[The CBN Family Channel|The Family Channel]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]&#39;&#39; television series replaces Bernardo with a teenager named Felipe, played by [[Juan Diego Botto]], with a similar disability and pretense.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Zorro gip.jpg|thumb|left|Zorro ([[Reed Hadley]]) in the serial &#39;&#39;[[Zorro&#39;s Fighting Legion]]&#39;&#39; (1939)]]\n\nIn &#39;&#39;The Curse of Capistrano&#39;&#39;, Diego is described as \&quot;a fair youth of excellent blood and twenty-four years, noted the length of [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] for his small interest in the really important things of life.\&quot; It is also said that \&quot;Don Diego was unlike the other full-blooded youths of the times. It appeared that he disliked action. He seldom wore his blade, except as a matter of style and apparel. He was damnably polite to all women and paid court to none.&amp;nbsp;... Those who knew Don Diego best declared he yawned ten score times a day.\&quot; Though proud as befitting his class (and seemingly uncaring about the lower classes), he shuns action, rarely wearing his sword except for fashion, and is indifferent to romance with women. This is, of course, a sham. At the end of the novel, Diego explains that he has planned his double identity since he was fifteen:\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\&quot;It began ten years ago, when I was but a lad of fifteen,\&quot; he said. \&quot;I heard tales of persecution. I saw my friends, the {{lang|es|frailes}}, annoyed and robbed. I saw soldiers beat an old native who was my friend. And then I determined to play this game.\n\n\&quot;It would be a difficult game to play, I knew. So I pretended to have small interest in life, so that men never would connect my name with that of the highwayman I expected to become. In secret, I practiced horsemanship and learned how to handle a blade\u2014\&quot;\n\n\&quot;By the saints, he did,\&quot; Sergeant Gonzales growled.\n\n\&quot;One half of me was the languid Don Diego you all knew, and the other half was the Curse of Capistrano I hoped one day to be. And then the time came, and my work began.\&quot;\n\n\&quot;It is a peculiar thing to explain, {{lang|es|se\u00f1ores}}. The moment I donned cloak and mask, the Don Diego part of me fell away. My body straightened, new blood seemed to course through my veins, my voice grew strong and firm, fire came to me! And the moment I removed cloak and mask I was the languid Don Diego again. Is it not a peculiar thing?&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\nThis part of the backstory was changed in the 1920 film &#39;&#39;[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]&#39;&#39;: Diego is recently returned from [[Spain]] at the start of the movie, and Zorro later tells Lolita that he learnt his swordsmanship in Spain. The 1925 sequel &#39;&#39;[[Don Q, Son of Zorro]]&#39;&#39; expands on this concept by saying that: \&quot;Though the home of the De Vegas has long been on California soil, the eldest son of each new generation returns to Spain for a period of travel and study.\&quot; The 1940 film &#39;&#39;[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]&#39;&#39; keeps the idea of Diego learning his swordsmanship in Spain, and adds the idea of him being unexpectedly summoned home by his father Don Alejandro when California fell into the hand of an oppressing dictator. Both ideas would then be included in most retelling of the character&#39;s backstory.\n\nMcCulley&#39;s portrayal of Diego&#39;s personality, with minor variations, is followed in most Zorro media.\n\nA notable exception to this portrayal is Disney&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]&#39;&#39; (1957\u201359), where Diego, despite using the original fa\u00e7ade early in the series, instead becomes a passionate and compassionate crusader for justice and simply masquerades as \&quot;the most inept swordsman in all of California\&quot;. In this show, everyone knows Diego would love to do what Zorro does, but thinks he does not have the skill.\n\nThe Family Channel&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]&#39;&#39; (1990\u20131993) takes this concept further. While Diego pretends to be inept with a sword, the rest of his facade is actually exaggerating his real interests. Diego is actually well-versed and interested in art, poetry, literature, and science. His facade is pretending to be interested in only these things and to have no interest in swordplay or action. Zorro also has a well-equipped laboratory in his hidden cave in this version of the story.\n\n==Inspirations==\nThe historical figure most often associated with the Zorro character is [[Joaquin Murrieta]], whose life was fictionalized in an 1854 [[dime novel]] by [[John Rollin Ridge]]. In the 1998 film &#39;&#39;[[The Mask of Zorro]]&#39;&#39; Murrieta&#39;s (fictitious) brother Alejandro succeeds Diego as Zorro. As a hero with a secret identity who taunts his foes by signing his deeds, Zorro finds a direct literary predecessor in Sir Percival Blakeney, hero of the &#39;&#39;[[The Scarlet Pimpernel|Scarlet Pimpernel]]&#39;&#39; [[pulp magazine|pulp series]] by [[Emma Orczy]].\n\nThe character recalls other figures, such as [[Robin Hood]], [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]], [[Salomon Pico]],&lt;ref&gt;Magill, Frank N. \&quot;Magill&#39;s Survey of Cinema: Silent Films\&quot;. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Salem Press, 1982. and Tompkins, Walker. Decade of the Desperado. Santa Barbara Magazine Vol. 8 No. 4, Santa Barbara. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Erdo\u00edza]], and [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]. Another possible historical inspiration is [[William Lamport]], an Irish soldier who lived in Mexico in the seventeenth century. His life was the subject of a fictive book by [[Vicente Riva Palacio]]; &#39;&#39;The Irish Zorro&#39;&#39; (2004) is a recent biography. Another is [[Estanislao]], a [[Yokuts]] man who led a revolt against the [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jose]] in 1827.\n\nThe 1890s [[penny dreadful]] treatment of the [[Spring-heeled Jack]] character as a masked avenger may have inspired some aspects of Zorro&#39;s heroic persona. Spring Heeled Jack was portrayed as a nobleman who created a flamboyant, masked [[alter ego]] to fight injustice, frequently demonstrated exceptional athletic and combative skills, maintained a hidden lair and was known to carve the letter \&quot;S\&quot; into walls with his rapier as a calling card.\n\nLike Sir Percy in &#39;&#39;[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]&#39;&#39;, Don Diego avoids suspicion by playing the role of an effete [[dandy]] who wears lace, writes poetry, and shuns violence. The all-black Fairbanks film costume, which with variations has remained the standard costume for the character, was likely adapted from the Arrow serial film character [[The Masked Rider (1919 film)|&#39;&#39;The Masked Rider&#39;&#39;]] (1919). This character was the first Mexican black-clad masked rider on a black horse to appear on the silver screen. Fairbanks&#39;s costume in &#39;&#39;The Mark of Zorro&#39;&#39;, released the following year, resembled that of the Rider with only slight differences in the mask and hat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serialsquadron.com/dvds/maskedrider/ The Masked Rider] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111122432/http://www.serialsquadron.com/dvds/maskedrider/ |date=January 11, 2016 }} The Serial Squadron&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Appearances in media==\n===Stories by Johnston McCulley===\n[[File:Argosy All-Story Weekly 19220506.jpg|thumb|&#39;&#39;The Further Adventures of Zorro&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]&#39;&#39; Vol. 142 No. 4, May 6, 1922.]]\nThe original stories were published in pulp magazines from the 1910s to the 1950s.

A company called Zorro Productions, Inc., asserts that it \&quot;controls the worldwide trademarks and copyrights in the name, visual likeness and the character of Zorro.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zorro.com/about.html \&quot;About Zorro Productions Inc.\&quot;] page from the company&#39;s web site&lt;/ref&gt; It further states \&quot;[t]he unauthorized, unlicensed use of the name, character and/or likeness of &#39;Zorro&#39; is an infringement and a violation of state and federal laws.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zorro.com/featured-products \&quot;Features Products\&quot;] page from the company&#39;s web site.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn 1999, [[TriStar Pictures]], a division of [[Sony Pictures]], sued Del Taco, Inc., due to a fast-food restaurant advertising campaign that allegedly infringed Zorro Productions&#39; claims to a trademark on the character of Zorro. Sony and TriStar had paid licensing fees to Zorro Productions, Inc., related to the 1998 film &#39;&#39;[[The Mask of Zorro]]&#39;&#39;.

Gertz died in 1961, and his estate transferred to his children, who created Zorro Productions, Inc. Fireworks Entertainment argued that the original rights had already been transferred to [[Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.]] in 1920 and provided documents showing this was legally affirmed in 1929, and also questioned whether the copyright was still valid.\n\nThe court ruled that \&quot;since the copyrights in &#39;&#39;The Curse of Capistrano&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;The Mark of Zorro&#39;&#39; lapsed in 1995 or before, the character Zorro has been in the public domain\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17573994030226630518&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr#r&amp;#91;31&amp;#93; Note 31] of &#39;&#39;Sony Pictures Entertainment v.

The main character is played by [[Robert Livingston (actor)|Robert Livingston]], who would then play the actual Zorro in the movie &#39;&#39;[[The Bold Caballero]]&#39;&#39;, also released in 1936.\n\n[[The Masked Rider]], the primary [[mascot]] of [[Texas Tech University]], is similar to Zorro. Originally called \&quot;Ghost Rider\&quot;, it was an unofficial mascot appearing in a few games in 1936 and then became the official mascot with the 1954 Gator Bowl.\n\nBeing one of the earliest examples of a fictional masked avenger with a double identity, Zorro inspired the creation of several similar characters in pulp magazines and other media, and is a precursor of the [[superheroes]] of American comic books. [[Bob Kane]] has credited Zorro as part of the inspiration for the character [[Batman]], which was created in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, Bill. \&quot;Batman: Commodity as Myth.\&quot; The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|0-85170-276-7}}, pp. 6\u20137&lt;/ref&gt; Like Don Diego de la Vega, Bruce Wayne is [[affluent]], the heir of wealth built by his parents. His everyday persona encourages others to think of him as shallow, foolish and uncaring to throw off suspicion. [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]&#39;s comic book miniseries &#39;&#39;[[The Dark Knight Returns]]&#39;&#39; (1986) and &#39;&#39;[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]&#39;&#39; (2001\u20132002) both include multiple Zorro references like the Batman inscribing a Z on a defeated foe. In later tellings of Batman&#39;s origins, Bruce Wayne&#39;s parents are murdered by a robber as the family leaves a showing of the 1940 film &#39;&#39;[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]&#39;&#39;, starring [[Tyrone Power]].\n\nZorro inspired a similar pulp character known as [[El Coyote (fictional character)|El Coyote]], which was created in 1943 by Jos\u00e9 Mallorqu\u00ed. A sample superhero character called The Fox appearing in the &#39;&#39;[[GURPS Supers|Supers]]&#39;&#39; supplement of the [[GURPS|GURPS role-playing system]] is also based on Zorro.\n\nThe 1954 &#39;&#39;[[Man with the Steel Whip]]&#39;&#39; [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] serial features a masked hero similar to Zorro, called El Latigo. Republic had previously released five Zorro serials between 1937 and 1949, but had since lost the licence for the character and could not use him anymore. The serial makes frequent use of [[stock footage]] from all five Zorro serials, with scenes originally showing Zorro now being interpreted as showing El Latigo: the result of this is that the costume and body shape of El Latigo keeps changing between scenes, even becoming female in scenes taken from &#39;&#39;[[Zorro&#39;s Black Whip]]&#39;&#39; (1944).&lt;ref name=\&quot;GMS\&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Harmon| first = Jim |author2=[[Donald F.

Hanna-Barbera Production&#39;s animated series &#39;&#39;[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]&#39;&#39; (1959\u20131962) features El Kabong, an alternate persona of the main character [[Quick Draw McGraw]], which is loosely based upon Zorro.\n\nIn the animated series &#39;&#39;[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]&#39;&#39; (2001\u20132004), a DC Comics character, [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]], bears a striking similarity to Zorro, in that he wears the same style hat, mask, sash and cape. The main difference is that his primary weapon is a whip. The Lazarus Lane version of El Diablo appears in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; (2004\u20132006), voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]]. While designed after his comic appearance, elements from Zorro&#39;s appearance were added in. Seen in the episode \&quot;[[The Once and Future Thing (Justice League Unlimited)|The Once and Future Thing]]\&quot; (2005), he appears alongside [[Pow Wow Smith]], [[Bat Lash]] and [[Jonah Hex]].\n\nIn 2015, The M7 Con Western Convention, held at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]] featured a segment on the history of Zorro in film and television. The presentation focused on the great Zorro actors including [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Tyrone Power]], [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]], and [[Duncan Regehr]]. Maestro Ramon Martinez and actor [[Alex Kruz]] gave a live demonstration of the [[Spain|Spanish]] style of fencing known as La Verdadera [[Destreza]].
