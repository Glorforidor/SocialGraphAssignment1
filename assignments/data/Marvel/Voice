The character, a scientist that debuted in a standalone [[science-fiction]] [[anthology]] story, returned several issues later as the original iteration of the superhero &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Ant-Man]]&#39;&#39;&#39; with the power to shrink to the size of an [[insect]]. Alongside his crime-fighting partner-wife [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], he goes on to assume other superhero identities, including the size-changing &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Giant-Man]]&#39;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]]&#39;&#39;&#39;; the insect-themed &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]]&#39;&#39;&#39;; and briefly the &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]&#39;&#39;&#39;. He is a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\nDebuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Hank Pym has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated films]]; [[video game]]s; and [[television series]]. [[Michael Douglas]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films &#39;&#39;[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]&#39;&#39; (2015), &#39;&#39;[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]&#39;&#39; (2018), and &#39;&#39;[[Avengers: Endgame]]&#39;&#39; (2019).\n\n==Publication history==\n\nHank Pym debuted in a seven-page solo cover story titled \&quot;The Man in the Ant Hill\&quot; (about a character who tests [[wikt:shrink|shrink]]ing technology on himself) in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] &#39;&#39;[[Tales to Astonish]]&#39;&#39; #27 ([[cover date]] Jan. 1962). The creative team was editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], [[penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]], and [[inker]] [[Dick Ayers]], with Lee stating in 2008: \&quot;I did one comic book called &#39;The Man in the Ant Hill&#39; about a guy who shrunk down and there were ants or bees chasing him. That sold so well that I thought making him into a superhero might be fun.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=William | last=Keck | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-06-22-marvel-magic_N.htm | title=Here come Marvel&#39;s &#39;Avengers,&#39; and Stan Lee, Joe Simon weigh in | work=[[USA Today]] | date=2008-06-22 | accessdate=2008-07-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706080444/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-06-22-marvel-magic_N.htm | archive-date=2008-07-06 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs a result, Pym was revived eight issues later as the costumed [[superhero]] &#39;&#39;&#39;Ant-Man&#39;&#39;&#39; who starred in the 13-page, three-chapter story \&quot;Return of the Ant-Man/An Army of Ants/The Ant-Man&#39;s Revenge\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Tales to Astonish&#39;&#39; #35 (Sept. 1962). The character&#39;s adventures became an ongoing feature in the title. Issue #44 (June 1963) featured the debut of his [[socialite]] girlfriend and laboratory assistant [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]]. Janet adopted the costumed identity of the Wasp, and co-starred in Pym&#39;s subsequent appearances in &#39;&#39;Tales to Astonish&#39;&#39;. Wasp also on occasion acted as a framing-sequence host for backup stories in the title. In September 1963, Lee and Kirby created the superhero title &#39;&#39;[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]&#39;&#39;, and Ant-Man and Wasp were established in issue #1 as founding members of the team.\n\nDecades later, Lee theorized as to why \&quot;Ant-Man never became one of our top sellers or had his own book,\&quot; saying,\n\n{{quote|I loved Ant-Man, but the stories were never really successful. In order for Ant-Man to be successful, he had to be drawn this small next to big things and you would be getting pictures that were visually interesting. The artists who drew him, no matter how much I kept reminding them, they kept forgetting that fact. They would draw him standing on a tabletop and they would draw a heroic-looking guy. I would say, &#39;Draw a matchbook cover next to him, so we see the difference in size.&#39; But they kept forgetting. So when you would look at the panels, you thought you were looking at a normal guy wearing an underwear costume like all of them.

When the team disbanded after a series of tragedies, Pym, using the Yellowjacket persona again, took a leave of absence beginning with vol. 3, #85 (Sept. 2004).&lt;ref&gt;The issue was alternately numbered #500 (of the first volume) in an anniversary return to the original series numbering.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFollowing the death of van Dyne, a grieving Pym took on yet another superhero identity as the new iteration of &#39;&#39;&#39;Wasp&#39;&#39;&#39;, in tribute to the woman he had married and divorced by this time, in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] publication &#39;&#39;[[Secret Invasion|Secret Invasion: Requiem]]&#39;&#39; (Jan. 2009). Giant-Man appeared as a supporting character in &#39;&#39;[[Avengers Academy]]&#39;&#39; from issue #1 (Aug. 2010) through its final issue #39 (Jan. 2013).  Pym returned as the Wasp in the mini-series &#39;&#39;Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp&#39;&#39; (Jan. 2011), and also appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 &#39;&#39;Secret Avengers&#39;&#39; series, from issue #22 (April 2012) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).\n\nAfter &#39;&#39;Secret Avengers&#39;&#39;, Pym joined the &#39;&#39;Avengers A.I.&#39;&#39; after beating his creation, [[Ultron]].

Pym&#39;s experience in the anthill inspires him to study ants, and he constructs a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] helmet that allows him to communicate with and control them. Pym designs a costume made of [[unstable molecules]] to prevent bites or scratches from the ants, and reinvents himself as the superhero Ant-Man.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Tales to Astonish&#39;&#39; #35 (Sept. 1962).

Vernon is subsequently killed by an alien criminal who teleports himself to Earth, and Janet asks for Pym&#39;s help in avenging Vernon&#39;s death. Pym reveals his secret identity to Janet, and uses Pym particles to graft [[wasp]] wings beneath her shoulders, which appear when Janet shrinks.
