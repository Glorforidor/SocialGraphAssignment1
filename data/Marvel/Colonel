The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of [[Captain America]], although its use has continued after the fall of the Soviet Union. \n\n[[David Harbour]] will portray the Alexei Shostakov incarnation of Red Guardian in the 2020 film &#39;&#39;[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]&#39;&#39; set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/everything-we-know-about-black-widow/|title=Everything We Know About BLACK WIDOW|website=Nerdist|access-date=2019-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; \n\n==Aleksey Lebedev==\n&#39;&#39;&#39;Aleksey Lebedev&#39;&#39;&#39; (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432), the Golden Age version of Red Guardian, first appeared in &#39;&#39;Namor, The Sub-Mariner Annual&#39;&#39; #1 (June 1991), created by writers Dana Moreshead and Mike Thomas, and artist [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]]. Very little is known of him, but he fought alongside [[Spirit of &#39;76 (Marvel Comics)|Captain America]] (William Naslund) and the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] at the [[Potsdam Conference]], in July, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/redgrd.htm |title=Red Guardian (Russian, World War II, Captain America ally) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his career during World War II and met the [[All-Winners Squad]] (formerly the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]) on only one recorded occasion, clashing with them shortly after the war&#39;s end, where he taunted Captain America (secretly the [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]]) that he was &#39;slowing down&#39; after he was able to catch Captain America&#39;s shield.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America: Patriot&#39;&#39; #2&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other crusaders of the same name, he was created as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America.{{issue|date=March 2013}} He was later apparently killed during the purges of the 1950s, opposing the brutal experiments that would later create his successor.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update 2010&#39;&#39; #4&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Alexei Shostakov==\n&#39;&#39;&#39;Alexei Alanovich Shostakov&#39;&#39;&#39; was the second version of Red Guardian, and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]].\n\nAlexei Shostakov was born in [[Moscow]], and was the husband of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife became agents of the Soviets: the latter as the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] while the former became a test pilot and KGB agent and then trained as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America as the \&quot;Red Guardian\&quot;.\n\nAlexei Shostakov was one of the Soviet Union&#39;s most acclaimed pilots. During World War II on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], he shot down a large number of [[Luftwaffe]] fighter planes in aerial battles and was credited for helping the [[Soviet Air Force]] win air supremacy over the skies of [[Stalingrad]] and [[Kursk]]. Because of his extraordinary skill, Shostakov was chosen for the most secret and dangerous tests and new aircraft for the Soviet Union. This included being the first pilot to test fly the [[MiG-15]]. The Soviet state controlled news media greatly publicized this and certain other missions of his such as his aerial battles against the [[U.S. Air Force]] over [[MiG Alley]] during the [[Korean War]]. As a result, Shostakov was decorated as a hero of the Soviet Union. Shostakov was also successful in his private life, having married the equally famous ballerina Natalie (familiarly known as Natasha) Romanova.\n\nAs the Cold War flared up in the 1950s, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] realized that the Soviet Union needed its own equivalent to Captain America. Khrushchev chose Alexi Shostakov over [[Yuri Gagarin]] who would later become the first man in space. The KGB faked his death and trained him in secret, keeping his survival a secret from Natasha. He became a master of hand-to-hand combat and a highly skilled athlete. In addition, he carried a throwing disc on his belt which could be used against an opponent. Magnetic force returned the disc after throwing. The disc had the yellow hammer and sickle symbol on it and his costume was red with a star on his chest to symbolise the Soviet flag. While the Black Widow became disillusioned with KGB masters and defected to the United States, the Red Guardian remained loyal and became more ruthless and vindictive. The Red Guardian battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with his Chinese ally Colonel Ling, to protect a Communist Chinese secret weapon located at a secret military base at an unrevealed location in the People&#39;s Republic of China, encountering the Black Widow and [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers). When the Black Widow noticed \&quot;something familiar\&quot; about him, Red Guardian revealed his identity. He was shot and mortally wounded minutes later by Colonel Ling while saving the lives of the Black Widow and Captain America. He was buried under molten lava when a laser blast caused the eruption of a long-dormant volcano.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; #43-44&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSome time later, a [[Life Model Decoy]] was patterned after Alexei Shostakov was introduced in the \&quot;[[Widowmaker (Marvel Comics)|Widow Maker]]\&quot; crossover between the &#39;&#39;[[Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Black Widow&#39;&#39; titles as &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]&#39;&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Widowmaker&#39;&#39; #1 (February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The LMD initially starts assassinating spies and eventually targets [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and Black Widow. After he was seemingly destroyed in his first battle with the Black Widow,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Graphic Novel&#39;&#39; Vol. 1 #61&lt;/ref&gt; the LMD was later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within [[Bulgaria]] as Ronin. The LMD was responsible for a plot to capture and try his \&quot;former wife\&quot; for crimes as a Soviet super soldier but his plan is foiled with the help of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Daredevil&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #64&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Dr. Tania Belinsky==\n{{Main|Starlight (Marvel Comics)}}\nDr. Tania Belinsky, a neurosurgeon from the USSR, later adopted the costumed Red Guardian identity and joined the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]], she first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]&#39;&#39; #35 (May 1976).\n\n==Josef Petkus==\nThe fourth Red Guardian, &#39;&#39;&#39;Josef Petkus&#39;&#39;&#39; first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]&#39;&#39; #352 (April 1989), and was created by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and artist [[Kieron Dwyer]]. The character subsequently appears in &#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; #319-324 (July\u2013October 1990), &#39;&#39;Incredible Hulk&#39;&#39; #393 (May 1992), and &#39;&#39;Soviet Super-Soldiers&#39;&#39; #1 (November 1992). The character subsequently appears as the &#39;&#39;&#39;Steel Guardian&#39;&#39;&#39; in &#39;&#39;Iron Man&#39;&#39; #9 (October 1998). Petkus appeared as part of the \&quot;Supreme Soviets\&quot; entry in the &#39;&#39;[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update &#39;89]]&#39;&#39; #7.\n\nJosef Petkus was a special operative for the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union, and appeared as a member of the militant [[Supreme Soviets]]. Alongside the Supreme Soviets, he attacked the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]] for defecting from the Soviet Union. Alongside Captain America, he later battled a bear-like creature composed of the [[Darkforce]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; #352-353&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Soviets were later renamed the post-Soviet [[Russia]]n super-team called the [[Winter Guard]]. Alongside this confederacy, he teamed with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Alpha Flight]] to battle the Peace Corpse, the [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] Army, and the Combine.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; #319-324&lt;/ref&gt; Petkus later joined a Winter Guard splinter group called the [[People&#39;s Protectorate]], now calling himself the \&quot;Steel Guardian\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man&#39;&#39; vol. 3, #9&lt;/ref&gt; When he and his team went off in search of the timelord [[Immortus]] hoping to find a way to resurrect Vanguard&#39;s sister, Lanyia. They agreed to fighting off Dire Wraiths invading his realm in exchange for this favor, Joseph being killed while in the line of duty.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Darkstar and the Winter Guard&#39;&#39; #2&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Krassno Granitsky==\nA fifth Red Guardian, &#39;&#39;&#39;Krassno Granitsky&#39;&#39;&#39;, appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Maverick (Marvel Comics)|Maverick]]&#39;&#39; #10 (June 1998), created by writer Jorge Gonzales and artist Leo Fernandez. He teamed up with the mercenary superhero Maverick to battle a crime lord.\n\nThe name \&quot;Krassno Granitsky\&quot; comes from the [[James Bond]] novel &#39;&#39;[[From Russia, with Love (novel)|From Russia With Love]]&#39;&#39;; it is the Russianized name of the assassin Donovan \&quot;Red\&quot; Grant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} He also appeared in the first issue of [[Ed Brubaker]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39;, where he was executed by [[Aleksander Lukin]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; vol. 5, #1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Anton==\nThe sixth Red Guardian, &#39;&#39;&#39;Anton&#39;&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;She-Hulk&#39;&#39; Vol 2. #35&lt;/ref&gt; made his first appearance in the first issue of [[Jeph Loeb]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Hulk]]&#39;&#39; series as a member of the [[Winter Guard (comics)|Winter Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Hulk vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Anton claims to be an engineer and a former Crimson Dynamo pilot, and was later revealed to be (at least partially) a [[Life Model Decoy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference|Title = Hulk: Winter Guard|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = December 2009|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nHe was decapitated by a [[Dire Wraith]], although his head was kept in storage, seemingly still alive.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Darkstar-2-3\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Darkstar and the Winter Guard&#39;&#39; #2-3&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Nicolai Krylenko==\nNicolai Krylenko, also known as [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]], is the seventh Red Guardian, and leads the Winter Guard.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Darkstar-2-3\&quot; /&gt;\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nNone of the Red Guardian&#39;s various identity users have been revealed to possess [[superhuman]] powers or abilities, with the exception of Tania Belinsky after her mutation by the Presence, the Ultimate version, the seventh Red Guardian, and Krylenko. All are highly skilled athletes. Shostakov was an expert pilot, a master hand-to-hand combatant, and was trained in espionage techniques by the KGB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the Guardians but Alexei and Tania have used a Steel shield similar to that used by Captain America. Alexei and Tania used a \&quot;belt-buckle\&quot; disc, a hurling weapon which magnetically returned to the wearer&#39;s hand when thrown, and was a part of their costume&#39;s [[Buckle|belt buckle]]. The fourth Red Guardian; Josef Petkus often employed an energized sword as a secondary armament alongside his shield.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Incredible Hulk&#39;&#39; Vol 1 #393 May 1, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth Red Guardian was an LMD named Anton, whose powers are cybernetic based. His falsified backstory was that he&#39;s an expert engineer and former Crimson Dynamo pilot, his real strength lies in his moderate degree of enhanced cybernetic physicality. The latest Red Guardian is [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Nikolai Krylenko/Vanguard]], brother to Laynia Petrovna; whose powers are derived from his mutation.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Soviet Super Soldiers&#39;&#39; Vol 1 #1 Nov 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Which stems to a fullbody force field that repels electromagnetic and kinetic energy, forces he can best guide and direct through a medium like the technically advanced Vibranium Shield supplied to him by Executive Security Committee.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Darkstar and the Winter Guard&#39;&#39; Vol 1 #2\u20133 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Or through a crux like the symbol of his home country; A sickle and hammer.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man&#39;&#39; Vol 1 #109-112 1978&lt;/ref&gt; He also directs this force against the earth itself to obtain flight. Nikolai wears a more advanced suit than previous Red Guardians, which is lined with circuitry that works in conjunction with the compact computer on his shield. Not only enabling the guided flight and return of which through their digital connection, but the amplification of the effects of his own energy field.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Age of Heroes&#39;&#39; Vol 1 #3 Jul 21 2010&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Exiles/Earth-3470===\nIn one of the &#39;&#39;[[Exiles]]&#39;&#39; realities, a Red Guardian in full body armor on Earth-3470 appears.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Exiles&#39;&#39; #84&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Civil War: House of M===\nRed Guardian was seen as a member of the Soviet Super Soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Civil War: House of M #2&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nA Red Guardian is seen as one of the many zombies roaming New York looking for victims.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Alexei Shostakov is a Russian super soldier codenamed \&quot;Captain Russia\&quot;. Meant to be the Russian version of [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]], this version is certifiably insane and uses a makeshift shield created partially from human remains, and possesses superhuman strength and durability. A fight between the two results in Captain America defeating him, by stabbing him with splintered wood that acts as a stake through the chest, declaring \&quot;Fighting is about winning\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Nightmere&#39;&#39; #1-4&lt;/ref&gt; Shostakov was once married to [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and is now deceased.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&#39;&#39; #1-2&lt;/ref&gt; \n{{Comics character list header\n|name       = Colonel\n|Marvelwiki = \n|CBDBid     = 4345\n|GCDid      = Colonel\n}}\n&#39;&#39;&#39;Colonel Abdul al-Rahman&#39;&#39;&#39; from [[Azerbaijan]] (leader of the [[Masters of Evil|Liberators]]) was based on the Red Guardian. As the character was a parallel to Captain America, he wears a predominantly red costume and was transformed into a super-soldier by [[Russians|Russian]] scientists as well as uses a weapon which resembles a double bladed [[lightsaber]].
