He is one of the first Earth Deviants created. Besides being a shapeshifter, he is immortal. He hides this from his fellow Deviants by pretending to be a long line of fathers/sons. Also hidden from the Deviants is his long-standing (20,000 years) on-off relationship with Thena, leader of the Eternals and mother of their twin children, Donald & Deborah Ritter. This relationship unravels during the course of the story.In the past, Kro has disguised himself as the Devil in order to try to influence or frighten humans. His control over his own molecules renders him immune to the genetic manipulations of Ghaur.After the death of Brother Tode, Kro became a figurehead monarch  for the Deviants and have a power struggle with Priestlord  Ghaur. After the disintegration of Ghaur, Kro remained as unique leader of the Deviants. However he becomes depressed and adbicated the throne to search Thena again.  Kro is also the founder of the Deviant team Delta Network, and lead them in an attempt to rescue the Avengers  from a resurrected Ghaur  Kro and Ghaur formed bickering factions and kept the struggle for power in Deviant Lemuria. The external world didn't know who was in charge. Kro remained as the formal monarch Much later, the Deviants males were rendered sterile and a power struggle between Ereshkigal and Ghaur happened. Ghaur won when he promised the deviants the return of the fertility with the help of the kidnapped eternal Phastos. The Asgardian god Thor rescued Phastos and battled Ghaur. Kro approached Ereshkigal  and activated the Asgardian Unbiding stone, but it got out of control, threatening all reality . When Thor destroyed the stone, Ghaur and Ereshkigal disappeared and Kro was left leading the Deviants.\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nDespite his Deviant heritage, Kro possesses a number of superhuman traits characteristic of an Eternal. Kro maintains a virtually unbreakable mental control over the processes and structure of his body even when he is asleep or unconscious. As a result, Kro has a lifespan that has already lasted over 20,000 years and is immune to disease and aging. His mental control over his body enables him to maintain a youthful, vigorous physical condition. Kro is not as nearly indestructible as the Eternals. (For example, Ikaris nearly killed Kro once by strangulation.) But while sufficient force can kill Kro, he can use his mental control over his body to heal himself after being injured.\nKro also possesses the power of physical malleability, which is atypical for a Deviant. At will he can cause most of the tissue of his body to become pliant, enabling him to shape it mentally like putty into different configurations. Once the tissue is set in an altered form, Kro has only to stop concentrating and his body will retain that shape until such time as he concentrates upon changing it again. This ability enables him to disguise himself and take the appearance of others (with cosmetic help for skin color, body hair, and so forth). One of Kro's favorite ploys is to pass himself off among ordinary humanity as a demon by fashioning horns on his head.\nHowever, Kro's shape-changing powers are limited. He cannot alter the shape of his skeleton in more than minor ways. Moreover, he cannot eliminate any of his mass while transforming; he can only redistribute his 320 pounds of weight. Hence, he usually only uses his shape-changing power to alter his facial features. He can mentally mold the shape of his skull somewhat.\nKro has about three times the physical endurance of an ordinary human athlete. His heart is not located in the same place as an ordinary human being's; its true location is unrevealed.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nKro is set to make his cinematic debut in the upcoming film Eternals, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Eternal #4 - #6 (2004)\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"K\" in the Encyclopaedia Olympianna\nMarvel Directory entry on Kro\nThe Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics' Creators\nKro on Marvel Database, a Marvel Comics wiki"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
