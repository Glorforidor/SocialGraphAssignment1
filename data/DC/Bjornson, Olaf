Though the membership roster has undergone changes over the years, the team has been portrayed most consistently as having seven core members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/72 72]-74 |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent |url-access=registration |accessdate=15 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn their most well-known incarnation, the Blackhawks operate from a hidden base known only as Blackhawk Island, fly [[Grumman XF5F Skyrocket]] planes, and shout their battle cry of \&quot;Hawk-a-a-a!\&quot; as they descend from the skies to fight tyranny and oppression. Clad in matching blue and black uniforms (with Blackhawk himself boasting a hawk insignia on his chest), early stories pitted the team against the [[Axis powers]], but they would also come to battle recurring foes such as King Condor and Killer Shark, as well as encounter an array of gorgeous and deadly [[femme fatale]]s. They also frequently squared off against fantastical war machines ranging from amphibious \&quot;shark planes\&quot; and flying tanks, to the aptly named War Wheel, a gigantic rolling behemoth adorned with spikes and machine guns.\n\nAt the height of his popularity in the early 1940s, Blackhawk titles routinely outsold every other comic book but [[Superman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Murray (writer)|Murry, Will]]. \&quot;An interview with Chuck &#39;Blackhawk&#39; Cuidera\&quot;. &#39;&#39;Comic Book Marketplace&#39;&#39; #68, May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackhawk also shares the distinction of being just one of five comic book superheroes to be published continuously in their own titles from the 1940s up to the 1960s (the others being [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Phantom (comics)|The Phantom]]). \n\nThe comic series has spawned a [[film serial]], a [[radio|radio series]], a [[novel]] and a future Steven Spielberg-produced feature film. A grounded version of Blackhawk named Ted Gaynor appeared in the [[Arrow (season 1)|first]] season of &#39;&#39;Arrow&#39;&#39; played by [[Ben Browder]].\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Creation===\nLike many of his [[Golden Age of Comic Books|golden age]] and [[Silver Age of Comic Books|silver age]] comic book counterparts, the creation of Blackhawk has been the subject of sometimes-contentious debate. [[Will Eisner]] has at times been considered the characters&#39; primary creator, with Eisner himself acknowledging the contributions of [[Charles Nicholas#Chuck Cuidera|Chuck Cuidera]] and writer [[Bob Powell (comics)|Bob Powell]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Blackhawk260Bylines\&quot;&gt;[[Catherine Yronwode|Yronwode, Catherine]]. \&quot;Who&#39;s Who: An Interview With Will Eisner\&quot;. &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #260 (July 1983). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOver the years, Cuidera became increasingly vocal that he did much more work on Blackhawk than Eisner and that he had in fact already started creating the characters prior to joining Eisner&#39;s studio.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Michael. &#39;&#39;Will Eisner: A Dreamer&#39;s Life in Comics&#39;&#39;. (Bloomsbury USA, 2010). pp. 72\u201373.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cuidera, he and Powell fleshed out the concept, deciding on everything from names and nationalities, to the characters&#39; distinguishing traits, uniforms, and the aircraft they would fly.&lt;ref name=\&quot;steranko\&quot;&gt;[[Jim Steranko|Steranko, Jim]]. &#39;&#39;The Steranko History of Comics&#39;&#39; Volume 2. (Supergraphics, 1972). pp. 52\u201361.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn 1999, Eisner addressed his view of the matter during a [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] panel:\n\n{{quote|It&#39;s not important who created it...it&#39;s the guy who kept it going, and made something out if it that&#39;s more important. Whether or not Chuck Cuidera created or thought of Blackhawk to begin with is unimportant.

That issue, &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #9, picked up the numbering of Quality&#39;s canceled &#39;&#39;[[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam Quarterly]]&#39;&#39;. They meanwhile continued to be featured prominently in &#39;&#39;Military Comics&#39;&#39;, later renamed &#39;&#39;Modern Comics&#39;&#39;, until that book&#39;s cancellation with #102 (October 1950).\n\nDuring the Quality years, a whole host of well-respected talent worked on the character, including writers [[Manly Wade Wellman]], Bill Woolfolk, [[Bill Finger]], and Dick French,&lt;ref name=\&quot;dcarchive\&quot;&gt;[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]] (2001). &#39;&#39;The Blackhawk Archives Volume 1&#39;&#39;.

Omnigraphics, Inc. pp. 87\u201390. Archived at [[Google Books]]. Retrieved April 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nQuality Comics ceased operations with comics cover-dated December 1956, with &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #107 being the final issue published by Quality. The character and title trademarks were initially leased on a royalty basis to National Periodical Publications (now [[DC Comics]]) before eventually being sold in their entirety.&lt;ref name=\&quot;superhero\&quot; /&gt;\n\n===Acquired by DC Comics===\nBlackhawk was one of the few Quality series that DC chose to keep running uninterrupted. Penciller Dick Dillin and inker Chuck Cuidera remained on the title, ensuring a near-seamless transition. The duo would stay with the title through nearly its entire first run at DC.\n\nSteering deeper and deeper into the realm of science fiction, the Blackhawks found themselves confronting a steady stream of unmemorable and mostly one-off [[supervillain]]-like adversaries bent on world domination.\n\nThe Blackhawks also gained a new ally in &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #133 (February 1959): [[Lady Blackhawk#Zinda Blake|Lady Blackhawk]], a pilot named Zinda Blake who was determined to become the first female member of the team. After a couple of appearances, she was granted honorary status and became a semi-frequent member of the supporting cast.\n\nIn an effort to update the characters, DC gave the team its first ever major wardrobe overhaul in &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #197 (June 1964), replacing their longtime uniforms with red and black shirts and green pants. On a dramatic level, Lady Blackhawk was transformed into a supervillain, Queen Killer Shark, in &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #200 (September 1964).\n\nThen, in a much more drastic attempt to combat flagging sales due to the rising popularity of [[superhero]] books and the [[Batman (TV series)|Batman TV series]], DC proclaimed with &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #228 (January 1967) the beginning of \&quot;the New Blackhawk Era\&quot; with a cover featuring [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] members [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Green Lantern]], and [[Flash (DC Comics character)|the Flash]] observing that the Blackhawks are (in Superman&#39;s words) \&quot;washed up\&quot; and (in Batman&#39;s words) \&quot;junk-heap heroes.\&quot; In the issues that followed, all but Blackhawk gained a costumed superhero [[alter ego]] at the behest of a shadowy government agency.\n\nWith sales continuing to sink, the Blackhawks were restored to something that more closely resembled their original roots in &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #242 (August 1968), losing the superhero identities in favor of their traditional blue and black uniforms. It was too late though; the comic was canceled for the first time one issue later.\n\n===1970s===\nJust over seven years later, DC Comics resurrected the series with &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #244 (January 1976) as part of an ongoing mid-1970s expansion of the line dubbed \&quot;Conway&#39;s Corner\&quot; in house ads. The Blackhawks were transplanted to the 1970s and now portrayed as mercenaries-for-hire, matching wits against fancifully bizarre new villains, as well as a re-imagined Killer Shark and War Wheel. This run ended with &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #250 (January 1977).\n\n===1980s\u20131990s===\nAmid rampant rumors that [[Steven Spielberg]] was interested in Blackhawk as a possible film project, DC Comics once again resumed the series. Initially conceived as being published quarterly, editor [[Len Wein]] convinced DC to make the book monthly and eventually assembled a team that included writer [[Mark Evanier]] and artist [[Dan Spiegle]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;companion\&quot;&gt;Kooiman, Mike. [http://qualitycomics.blogspot.com/2011/12/mark-evanier-discusses-blackhawk.html \&quot;Mark Evanier discusses Blackhawk and Plastic Man\&quot;]. \&quot;The Quality Companion Companion\&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #251 (October 1982) returned the team to a World War II setting and restored many of the familiar trappings that had been shed over the years during the various attempts to modernize the characters. Numerous new supporting characters were introduced during the run, most notably Domino, a buxom Nazi assassin and love interest to Blackhawk who was reminiscent of the femme fatales so common during the Quality Comics era. Evanier also reintroduced arch-villain Killer Shark, and has said he would have likely added Lady Blackhawk to the cast had the series lasted longer.&lt;ref name=\&quot;companion\&quot; /&gt; But faced with stagnant sales that Evanier attributed largely to DC&#39;s lack of interest in publicizing the series,&lt;ref name=\&quot;companion\&quot; /&gt; the book was canceled with &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #273 (November 1984). Though it wouldn&#39;t be known at the time, that issue would mark the definitive end of the series&#39; original issue numbering.\n\nSometime after the cancellation, DC employed writer [[Bill DuBay]] and artist [[Carmine Infantino]] to produce a Blackhawk mini-series. Though never published, numerous finished pages exist.&lt;ref&gt;Amash, Jim; Nolen-Weathington, Eric (2010).

Retrieved April 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn 1988, a three-issue mini-series by [[Howard Chaykin]] re-imagined the team during World War II yet again, this time with a notably more adult and gritty take on the characters. Chaykin, for the most part, eschewed the team dynamic so familiar to Blackhawk readers, instead crafting a politically charged espionage thriller that focused prominently on Blackhawk and a new version of [[Lady Blackhawk#Natalie Reed|Lady Blackhawk]]. Post-war stories respecting Chaykin&#39;s continuity followed in &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics|Action Comics Weekly]]&#39;&#39; #601\u2013608, #615\u2013622, and #628\u2013635, as well as in a monthly series that restarted with an issue #1 and ran 16 issues from March, 1989, to August, 1990.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = | contribution = Blackhawk | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 54  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn 1992, DC Comics published &#39;&#39;Blackhawk Special&#39;&#39; #1. Still respecting Chaykin&#39;s continuity and set 10 years after the events of &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #16, the story spans a five-year period as Blackhawk seeks to avenge the death of team member Andr\u00e9.\n\n===More recent appearances===\nSince 1992, mostly modern hints of the team have appeared, usually in the form of the \&quot;Blackhawk Express\&quot; courier service, or the time-displaced [[Lady Blackhawk#Zinda Blake|Lady Blackhawk]]. One of the best examples of this is the 1990s appearance of team member Chop-Chop in a few issues of DC&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Hawkworld]]&#39;&#39; series.\n\nOther Blackhawk air pilot groups have been shown during present time or alternate future events such as &#39;&#39;[[Our Worlds At War]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]&#39;&#39;. It is unknown which connection beyond homage and inspiration, if any, those groups have to the classic Blackhawks. Blackhawk at this time is an extension of [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]].\n\nDC Comics reprinted the Blackhawk features from the first 17 issues of &#39;&#39;Military Comics&#39;&#39; in &#39;&#39;The Blackhawk Archives Volume 1&#39;&#39; (2001) as part of its hardcover [[DC Archive Editions]] series.\n\nBlackhawk made an appearance in &#39;&#39;[[The Brave and the Bold#Volume 3|The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39; Vol. 3 #9 (February 2008), teaming up with the [[Boy Commandos]] during a World War II tale.\n\nThe Blackhawks appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Superman &amp; Batman: Generations]]&#39;&#39; 2, in which they help [[Superman]], [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]], and [[Hawkman]] battle a robot during the war. During the battle, Chuck sacrifices himself to destroy a missile.  During the same storyline in 1997, a heroine named Blackhawk appears, battling [[Sinestro]]. According to [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]&#39;s liner notes in &#39;&#39;Generations 3&#39;&#39; #1, this character is Janet Hall, the granddaughter of the original Blackhawk, as well as [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)]] and [[Hawkgirl|Hawkgirl (Shiera Sanders)]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===The New 52===\n{{See also|Blackhawks (DC Comics)}}\nIn September 2011 as part of its [[The New 52|New 52]] publishing revamp, DC Comics launched a monthly series titled &#39;&#39;[[Blackhawks (DC Comics)|Blackhawks]]&#39;&#39; with no direct ties to the previous incarnations. The book is set in the present day with no appearances by, or mention of, prior Blackhawks, although there is a new version of the [[Lady Blackhawk]] character.

Captain von Tepp and his Butcher Squadron swarm the skies in response, outnumbering the Polish four to one. The Germans decimate their foes until just one lone plane \u2014 painted jet black \u2014 remains. After gallantly shooting down six Nazi planes, the mysterious pilot is forced to crash land on the countryside. Running to a nearby farmhouse, he&#39;s tracked from the air by von Tepp, who drops a bomb and destroys the building. The pilot locates his dead sister and mortally wounded brother inside. He vows to kill von Tepp before disappearing into the darkness.\n\nMonths later, with most of [[Europe]] collapsing under the might of the Nazis, the pilot reemerges with his own private squadron and \&quot;like an angel of vengeance, Blackhawk and his men swoop down out of nowhere, their guns belching death, and on their lips the dreaded song of the Blackhawks.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Military1\&quot; /&gt;\n\nIn France, Captain von Tepp receives a note from Blackhawk demanding the release of one of Blackhawk&#39;s men or face death. Infuriated, von Tepp orders the prisoner&#39;s execution by firing squad. At dawn, the man and two others, including a cool-headed English Red Cross nurse (identified as \&quot;Ann\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Military Comics&#39;&#39; #3), are lined against a wall and mocked by von Tepp. As his men prepare to fire, the song of the Blackhawks fills the air:\n\n{{quote|Over land, over sea,&lt;br /&gt;We fight to make men free,&lt;br /&gt;Of danger we don&#39;t care...&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re Blackhawks!&lt;ref name=\&quot;Military1\&quot; /&gt;}}\n\nWith the Blackhawks lining the walls of the courtyard, Blackhawk himself confronts von Tepp. After a brief skirmish, von Tepp is abducted and flown to the Blackhawks&#39; secret base in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], Blackhawk Island. It&#39;s there that Blackhawk challenges the Nazi captain to an aerial duel. During the ensuring dogfight, both of the men&#39;s planes are crippled and forced to crash. On the ground, von Tepp and Blackhawk, both badly injured, draw guns. Von Tepp falls in a hail of bullets.\n\nBlackhawk&#39;s team is mostly depicted in &#39;&#39;Military Comics&#39;&#39; #1 as shadowy, nondescript soldiers, save for an Englishman named Baker who&#39;s never seen or mentioned again. &#39;&#39;Military Comics&#39;&#39; #2 (September 1941) expands the role of the team in the featured adventure and introduces five members: Stanislaus, Andr\u00e9, Olaf, Hendrick (Hendrickson within a few issues), and Zeg. A sixth, Boris, is also shown, but, like Baker, only makes a single appearance. The designer of their planes, Vladim, is also mentioned.\n\nBy &#39;&#39;Military Comics&#39;&#39; #3 (October 1941), the roster is firmed up and it&#39;s stated that seven men belong to the team. The group also receives a Chinese mascot and cook, Chop-Chop, when his plane happens to crash on Blackhawk Island during a desperate run for help. The adventure concludes with the first on-page death of a team member: Andr\u00e9, who seemingly perishes in an avalanche that buries a large group of Nazis. In &#39;&#39;Military Comics&#39;&#39; #9 (April 1942), the roster is down to five plus Chop-Chop, with Zeg presumably the absent member. In that adventure, the team crosses paths with the mysterious Man in the Iron Mask; Andr\u00e9, in fact, now horribly disfigured, but still an enemy of the Nazis.\n\nThe most familiar version of the team is finally locked down in &#39;&#39;Military Comics&#39;&#39; #11 (August 1942) shown as consisting of Blackhawk, Olaf, Chuck, Andr\u00e9 (his face now reconstructed), Stanislaus, Hendrickson, and Chop-Chop.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; #50 (March 1952), the team&#39;s origin is documented.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Blackhawk50\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|story=Origin of the Blackhawks|title=Blackhawk #50|date=March, 1952|publisher=[[Quality Comics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackhawk himself is no longer identified as being Polish, but rather a Polish-American who is a volunteer flyer in the Polish Air Force. His sidekick in the squadron is Stanislaus, a \&quot;brilliant young student\&quot; from the [[University of Warsaw]]. After facing defeat against the Nazis, Blackhawk attempts to flee to [[Russia]], only to discover that Russian forces are invading from the east. He then seeks refuge in [[England]] where he attempts to join the [[Royal Air Force]]. It&#39;s in [[London]] where he and Stanislaus reunite and then meet the four others who will ultimately join them in their crusade: Chuck, another American volunteer; Hendrickson, a recent escapee from a Nazi concentration camp; Olaf, a Swede who had fought for Finland against the Russians; and Andr\u00e9, a \&quot;valiant Frenchman.\&quot; The six men wait to enlist in the R.A.F., but because none are British subjects, they are \&quot;held up by miles of red tape.\&quot; Finally, Blackhawk suggests they strike out on their own. They pool their resources and buy planes, setting up a base of operations first on a small island in the Atlantic Ocean, then later in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. They&#39;re eventually joined by Chop-Chop, described in this account as having \&quot;fled from [[China]] when the Japanese overpowered the [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist army]].\&quot; Chop-Chop first acts as the team&#39;s cook, but in time becomes an expert pilot and full member of the team.\n\n===Post-Crisis===\nAfter the &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39;, Blackhawk is once again Polish by birth and now given a definitive name, Janos Prohaska. Having joined the Polish Air Force at a young age, he had already become a national hero by 1936 alongside his trusted friends Stanislaus Drozdowski and Kazimierc \&quot;Zeg\&quot; Zegota-Januszajtis. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, the trio travel across Europe, providing freelance service and even fighting for a time in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as members of the [[Communist party]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;SecretOrigins45\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Martin Pasko]]|penciller=[[Grant Miehm]]|story=Citizen Jan|title=Secret Origins #45|date=October, 1989|publisher=[[DC Comics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAt one point finding himself in America in hopes of gathering funds to build a European resistance group, Prohaska is framed for a series of murders. With the help of the [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Sandman]], he&#39;s ultimately exonerated, but a report soon surfaces that he has been shot down and killed by Nazis somewhere in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Sandman\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Matt Wagner]]|penciller=Matthew Smith|story=The Blackhawk Acts 1\u20134|title=Sandman Mystery Theatre #45\u201348|date=December, 1996\u2013March, 1997|publisher=[[DC Comics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen the forces of Nazi Germany invade Poland in 1939, Prohaska returns home to help defend his homeland. He&#39;s unable to save his younger siblings, J\u00f3zek and Staszka, and soon forced to flee to Britain with Stanislaus and Zeg. It&#39;s there he meets the others who will form the foundation of the Blackhawk Squadron.\n\nIn the midst of the war, Prohaska finds himself under suspicion by the U.S. government for his Communist ties. Around this same time, the Blackhawks are joined by Captain Natalie Reed (born Natalie Gurdin), a brilliant Russian-American flight engineer who redesigns the Blackhawks&#39; aircraft and is dubbed [[Lady Blackhawk#Natalie Reed|Lady Blackhawk]] by the U.S. press. It&#39;s with her help that Prohaska is able to stop Nazi agent and onetime Hollywood actor Death Mayhew from detonating an [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] in [[New York City]]. The victory restores Blackhawk&#39;s reputation.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ChaykinBlackhawk\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Howard Chaykin]]|penciller=[[Howard Chaykin]]|title=Blackhawk Vol. 2 #1\u20133|date=March\u2013May, 1988|publisher=[[DC Comics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The New 52===\nIn 2011, the entire line of DC Comics was rebooted as part of \&quot;[[The New 52]].\&quot; In this new version the Blackhawks are an elite covert military unit taking care of High Technology Criminals.

She also introduces the Blackhawk Island, a place where cosmic energy conducted through the earth&#39;s metal core cancel&#39;s itself out, creating a kind of static that disrupts space-time, the Island served as well for many years as a base of operations for [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkgirl]].\n\nLady Blackhawk and the Blackhawks are featured in &#39;&#39;All-Star Batman&#39;&#39; second arc, \&quot;Ends of Earth\&quot;, they are seen hounding Batman, and they are shown to possesses an armor that has the ability to track eye-line movement, the armor also turns them invisible.\n\n==Team depictions==\n\n===Original incarnation===\nAfter a period of membership fluctuations during the first 10 issues of &#39;&#39;Military Comics&#39;&#39;, the team finally settles into its most famous roster. Although minor character details would shift and change over time, this original version of the team would stay largely intact from the characters&#39; debut in 1941 to the end of their first run in 1968. At one point or another, every member of the team except Blackhawk is depicted in ways [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] for the time, and over the course of the series several would develop their own [[catchphrase]]s.\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2013 First Polish, then American, the man known as Blackhawk is portrayed as a strong, decisive leader. He&#39;s not always easy on his men\u2014calling Olaf a \&quot;big fat-head,\&quot; for example&lt;ref name=\&quot;Military5\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Dick French|penciller=[[Charles Nicholas#Chuck Cuidera|Chuck Cuidera]]|story=Scavengers of Doom|title=Military Comics #5|date=December, 1941|publisher=[[Quality Comics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;\u2014but always appears to command their unquestionable respect. At one point late in the first series&#39; run, he&#39;s given a name, Bart Hawk.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Blackhawk242\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Bob Haney]], [[Marv Wolfman]]|penciller=[[Pat Boyette]]|story=Black Mask!|title=Blackhawk #242|date=August\u2013September, 1968|publisher=[[DC Comics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Stanislaus&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2013 Blackhawk&#39;s second-in-command. Polish, Stan is initially depicted like his teammates with various ethnic distinctions, but those disappear as the series progresses to the point that he could very well pass for an American. He is often portrayed as an acrobat, then later as the team&#39;s strongman.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Chuck&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2013 At different times stated as being from Brooklyn or Texas, Chuck is often shown as the team&#39;s communications specialist. His words are peppered with frequent American [[colloquialisms]] like \&quot;I reckon!\&quot; and \&quot;Dagnabbit!\&quot;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Hendrickson&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2013 Known as \&quot;Hendy\&quot; for short, the oldest of the Blackhawks is also their ever-dependable sharpshooter. Heavyset with white hair and a thick, Germanic mustache, he&#39;s usually portrayed as Dutch (though German in some accounts), and often exclaims, \&quot;Himmel!\&quot; (German for \&quot;sky\&quot; and \&quot;heaven\&quot;) or \&quot;Ach du lieber!\&quot; (a German phrase akin to \&quot;Oh, dear!\&quot;).\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Andr\u00e9&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2013 With his pencil-thin mustache and natural born suavity, Andr\u00e9&#39;s appreciation of beautiful women often leads the team into precarious situations. Their demolitions expert, he frequently utters \&quot;[[Sacrebleu|Sacre bleu]]!\&quot; (an old French profanity).\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Olaf&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2013 A giant of a man, Olaf is usually portrayed as Swedish, his brutish size and poor English playing into the \&quot;big, dumb Swede\&quot; stereotype. He often shouts, \&quot;Py Yiminy!\&quot; and demonstrates impressive acrobatic abilities (a trait that Stanislaus&#39; character loses over time).\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Chop-Chop&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2013 Chop-Chop is originally the team&#39;s Chinese cook and essentially Blackhawk&#39;s sidekick, riding along in Blackhawk&#39;s plane as opposed to piloting his own. He evolves over time from comic relief mascot to a valued member of the team proficient in the [[martial arts]]. His full name is eventually revealed to be Liu Huang.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Blackhawk203\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Bob Haney]]|penciller=[[Dick Dillin]]|story=Operation White Dragon|title=Blackhawk #203|date=December, 1964|publisher=[[DC Comics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOther short-term members are Baker, an Englishman, and Boris, a Russian. Both characters only make single panel appearances. Zeg, Polish like Blackhawk and Stanislaus, manages to last a bit longer, but is gone by the Blackhawk&#39;s ninth appearance in &#39;&#39;Military Comics&#39;&#39;.\n\nA significant ally to the team throughout the 1940s is [[Miss Fear]], who never formally joins the group but appears frequently during their Asian missions, developing a romantic interest in Blackhawk himself.\n\nThe strip&#39;s most significant supporting character, however, is Zinda Blake, also known as [[Lady Blackhawk#Zinda Blake|Lady Blackhawk]]. After a failed attempt to become the team&#39;s first female member,&lt;ref name=\&quot;Blackhawk133\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|penciller=[[Dick Dillin]]|story= The Lady Blackhawk|title=Blackhawk #133|date=February, 1959|publisher=[[DC Comics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is eventually awarded honorary status and makes numerous appears from 1959 to 1968, even becoming the villainess Queen Killer Shark for a time.\n\nThe team acquires an animal mascot in the 1950s, Blackie the hawk. Possessing remarkable intelligence\u2014he can type notes in plain English, among other skills\u2014and fitted with his own miniature belt radio, he&#39;s often shown perched on Blackhawk&#39;s shoulder.\n\n===1967&#39;s New Blackhawk Era===\n{{Quote box\n |width=35em\n |bgcolor=#d5e5fa\n |align=left\n |quote=\&quot;It&#39;s fact, sir \u2013 the Blackhawks are washed-up has-beens, out of date antiques, a danger to national security!

Fat, buck-toothed, and orange-skinned, he speaks in broken English, wears a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] hairstyle complete with a bow, and dresses in colorful [[coolie]] garb.

Evanier wrote of the piece:\n\n{{quote|He (let&#39;s assume it&#39;s a He) complains, \&quot;No longer does the Oriental Blackhawk bang no-goodniks on the head with manhole covers, exclaiming: &#39;Chop-Chop fixee so face look difflunt!&#39;\&quot; The writer loves this kind of stuff and then goes on to explain that to not depict Chop-Chop in this manner is the real insult. He writes, \&quot;Since Chop-Chop turned up full-grown in 1941, he might well have been born into a village in which the customs of Imperial China still lingered.\&quot; Referring to the fact that Chop-Chop no longer sports the ponytail: \&quot;Dequeueing him demonstrates not &#39;tolerance&#39; but cultural imperialism...to the extent that a working class Chinese spoke English, it would be pidgin, not the queen&#39;s...\&quot; Translation: The fat, stupid version was historically accurate.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Blackhawk263Bylines\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Mark Evanier]]|story=Blackhawk Bylines|title=Blackhawk #263|date=October, 1983|publisher=[[DC Comics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\nAn admittedly stunned Evanier readily denounced the column, challenging the editorial writer&#39;s assertion that [[Steven Spielberg]], at the time rumored to be interested in making a &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; film, should be faithful to the original depiction of Chop-Chop. Evanier wrote that it&#39;s amazing to him that \&quot;anyone could believe that Chinese folks were really obese and stupid in the forties,\&quot; or that Spielberg would ignore the box office and \&quot;commit professional suicide by so depicting them.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Blackhawk263Bylines\&quot; /&gt;\n\nWhen asked later if the editorial hastened Evanier&#39;s own approach to evolving the character, Evanier said he thought he would have pursued the same course regardless, giving the editorial \&quot;probably more attention than it deserved.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;companion\&quot; /&gt;\n\n==Aircraft==\n\n===Grumman XF5F Skyrocket===\nThe [[Grumman XF5F Skyrocket]] is the twin-engine fighter most identified with the Blackhawks.

As [[Will Eisner]] remembered:\n\n{{quote|So we came up with the idea of using a certain model Grumman airplane, which had a very strange configuration. It had tailfins coming out from under a wing. It also apparently had the capacity to make a rapid takeoff from the deck of an aircraft carrier. It was a Navy plane, as I remember, not an Army Air Force plane.

Quality Comics licensed the rights along with many of their other characters to London&#39;s [[Boardman Books]], which used them in a series of three-color reprints from 1948 to 1954. Boardman also reprinted Blackhawk stories in their &#39;&#39;Adventure Annual&#39;&#39; series of hardcover Christmas publications. Many of the British Blackhawk reprints were repackaged by Boardman art director [[Denis McLoughlin]], who created at least one British original Blackhawk story, as well as the illustrations for several &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; text stories. After Boardman&#39;s contract lapsed, Strato Publications launched a square-bound 68-page &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; series which ran for 37 issues between 1956 and 1958.\n\n==Early crossover==\nIn &#39;&#39;Hit Comics&#39;&#39; #26 (February 1943), Blackhawk participated in an early example of a crossover when fellow [[Quality Comics]] character [[Kid Eternity]] summons him to stop a mad scientist.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Flashpoint===\n* In the &#39;&#39;[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]&#39;&#39; reality, the Blackhawk Squadron, equipped with [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35s]] and with [[Hal Jordan]] and [[Carol Ferris]] among its pilots, respond to attacks on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)#New Themyscira|New Themyscira]], but are killed by Amazonian forces.&lt;ref name=\&quot;FlashpointHalJordan3\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Adam Schlagman]]|penciller=[[Cliff Richards]]|story=Hard-Travelling Hero|title=Flashpoint: Hal Jordan #3|date=August, 2011|publisher=[[DC Comics]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* A 1968 \&quot;presentation drawing\&quot; from [[Filmation]] depicts a red-shirted interpretation of Blackhawk and a member of the team fighting a pack of what appears to be four aliens, while [[Aquaman]] watches from the foreground.

When the Blackhawks join Superman and Hawkgirl in battle, Hawkgirl notices their logo. After Blackhawk salutes Hawkgirl, Superman comments \&quot;Friends of yours?\&quot;, to which Hawkgirl responds \&quot;They are now\&quot;. A lead Blackhawk (presumably Janos Prohaska/Bart Hawk) was voiced by [[Robert Picardo]].\n* The &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;I Am Legion\&quot; featured a now-elderly Chuck (voiced by [[Academy Award]]-nominee [[Seymour Cassel]]). According to Chuck, he was the only Blackhawk still living and he was married to Mairzey as the character was in the comic books. It was not revealed how the others died. The episode focused on [[Lex Luthor]], [[Key (comics)|The Key]], and [[Doctor Polaris]] raiding the decommissioned Blackhawk Island in order to steal the advanced technology the Blackhawks had acquired on various missions and stored there (the only item they do steal is the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Longinus]]). During a chase through the museum on the island, a statue or mannequin of [[Lady Blackhawk]] can be seen.  In the epilogue, Hawkgirl and Chuck pay their respects at a statue memorial to the deceased team members.\n* The &#39;&#39;[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Trust But Verify\&quot; featured a private security company called &#39;&#39;&#39;Blackhawk Squad Protection Group&#39;&#39;&#39;. An employee, Theodore Gaynor (played by [[Ben Browder]]), was [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle&#39;s]] (Oliver&#39;s bodyguard) former [[commanding officer]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Gaynor led a team of other Blackhawk employees in robbing armored cars, until he was killed by [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]].

Alyn had earlier been the first screen [[Superman]].\n* The Blackhawk squadron appears in the animated [[DVD]] movie &#39;&#39;[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]&#39;&#39;, but the pilots are unnamed. The only spoken line is the cry \&quot;Hawk-a-a-a!\&quot; from one of the pilots, presumably Blackhawk himself. As in the comic, the squadron intervenes at a crucial point, saving [[Batman]] and Green Arrow from being annihilated by the [[Dinosaur Island|Centre]]&#39;s creatures.\n* In April 2018, [[Steven Spielberg]] was announced to produce/direct a film adaptation of &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39; for [[Warner Bros.]], with the screenplay being written by [[David Koepp]]. Spielberg will co-produce the film with [[Kristie Macosko Krieger]] and Sue Kroll.&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2018/film/news/steven-spielberg-blackhawk-dc-1202756319/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-blackhawk/&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Radio===\n* The &#39;&#39;[[Blackhawk (radio)|Blackhawk]]&#39;&#39; radio series was broadcast Wednesdays at 5:30pm on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September to December 1950. [[Michael Fitzmaurice (actor)|Michael Fitzmaurice]] portrayed Blackhawk. At least 16 episodes were produced.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Harrison Boyd. A Thirty-Year History of Programs Carried on National Radio Networks in the United States, 1926\u20131956. Columbus, Ohio: Ohio State University, 1958. Reprinted by Arno Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Novel===\n* A novel titled &#39;&#39;Blackhawk&#39;&#39;, by [[William Rotsler]], was published in 1982, detailing the team&#39;s origin.\n\n===Toys===\n* A limited-edition Blackhawk [[G.I. Joe]] action figure was produced in 2002 by Dreams &amp; Visions, licensed by DC Comics and [[Hasbro]]. The figure wore the classic blue-black flight uniform from World War II with two additional outfits and accessory sets included: Blackhawk&#39;s red and green uniform from the mid to late 1960s, and an [[Arctic]] survival uniform in sky blue.\n* In July 2006 [[DC Direct]] released a 6.58\&quot; Blackhawk action figure as part of the Series 1 [[DC: The New Frontier]] toyline.\n* In 2009, [[Mattel]] released a Blackhawk figure that is part of their [[DC Universe: Justice League Unlimited Fan Collection|&#39;&#39;Justice League Unlimited&#39;&#39; toyline]].\n* In 2008, three Blackhawk figures were released for the Heroclix game from Wizkids / NECA. These represent Blackhawk himself, Stanislaus and Hendrickson. All have the standard blue and black squadron uniforms, although only Blackhawk has the hat. Blackhawk and Hendrickson are armed with assault rifles, while Stanislaus is armed with a service revolver. Blackhawk&#39;s base has a red edge (Veteran), Hendrickson&#39;s has a blue edge (Experienced), and Stanislaus&#39; has a yellow edge (Rookie). All three, not surprisingly, have the \&quot;Soldier\&quot; keyword, and Blackhawk himself also has the \&quot;Leadership\&quot; ability. All three figures have the word Blackhawk on the base.\n\n==Magazine parodies==\n* [[Mad (magazine)|&#39;&#39;MAD&#39;&#39; magazine]] featured a parody of Blackhawks called \&quot;Black and Blue Hawks\&quot;.\n* &#39;&#39;[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]&#39;&#39; produced a parody titled \&quot;Whitedove\&quot;, in which the heroes are inspectors from [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourworlds.net/blackhawk/media/issuedov.html \&quot;Whitedove\&quot; parody] at OurWorlds.net&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==See also==\n* [[PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b]] bomber\n* [[PZL P.11]] fighter\n* [[No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron]]\n* [[Polish Air Force|The history of the Polish Air Force]]\n* [[Polish contribution to World War II]]\n* [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]\n* [[List of film serials]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/g/gablahaw.htm Blackhawk] at the International Catalogue of Superheroes\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=2992|title=Blackhawk}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last=Scott\n|first=Cord\n|title=Comics and Conflict: Patriotism and Propaganda from WWII through Operation Iraqi Freedom|publisher=Naval Institute Press\n|year= 2014\n|isbn= 9781612514772\n|oclc=\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.today/20130105074553/http://ourworlds.topcities.com/blackhawk/index.html Unofficial Blackhawk comics site]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141129032926/http://www.dcindexes.com/features/database.php?pagetype=character&amp;id=202 Earth-2 Blackhawk Index]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141129033120/http://www.dcindexes.com/features/database.php?pagetype=character&amp;id=23 Earth-1 Blackhawk Index]\n* [http://www.cosmicteams.com/cosmic/Blackhawks.html Mike Kooiman&#39;s Blackhawk History 1940\u20132011]\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/g/gablahaw.htm Blackhawk Profile]\n* [http://www.coverbrowser.com/covers/blackhawk Blackhawk cover gallery]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040205023406/http://www.povonline.com/cols/COL305.htm Panel that discusses Blackhawk&#39;s creation (in two parts)]\n* [http://doctor-k100.blogspot.com/2008/02/day-job-keeping-up-with-chop-chop.html Article on the history of \&quot;Chop-Chop\&quot;]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 &#39;&#39;Military Comics&#39;&#39;, later retitled &#39;&#39;Modern Comics&#39;&#39; series was debuted by Quality Comics.
