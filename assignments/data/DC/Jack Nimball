[[Henry Czerny]] appeared in the television series &#39;&#39;[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]&#39;&#39; who had a son named Winslow Schott Jr. or Winn played by [[Jeremy Jordan (actor, born 1984)|Jeremy Jordan]]. He eventually used the Toyman name as part of the [[Legion of Superheroes]]. Jordan also played an alternate Earth version of Toyman as well.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Winslow Schott version of Toyman first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39; #64 (September 1943) and was created by Don Cameron and Ed Dobrotka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume Three: Superman |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=1-4012-1389-8 |pages=470-474}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Jack Nimball version of Toyman first appeared in &#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #432 and was created by [[Cary Bates]] and [[Curt Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |title=The Krypton Companion |date=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781893905610 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Hiro Okamura version of Toyman first appeared in &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #127 and was created by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Ed McGuinness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Winslow Schott===\n[[Image:Supesvstoyman.png|The Toyman vs. Superman, from the cover of &#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #64. Art by [[Joe Shuster]].|left|thumb]]\n\nThe Toyman first appeared in 1943 and appeared in several [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=444-445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schott appeared less frequently in comics published after the early 1950s, but remained a semi-regular foe during the &#39;60s, &#39;70s, and &#39;80s.\n\nWhile at first more of a nuisance, Toyman gradually grew more emotionally unstable and paranoid over time, his toys following suit by becoming a lot more dangerous. Although Winslow Schott in his civilian persona was a rather sweet, humble, quirky (if socially withdrawn) person, as Toyman he turned into a childish, destructive megalomaniac. During the &#39;70s Winslow was effectively retired from crime, but he kept contact with Superman and even helped out to take down Jack Nimball, who he felt sullied the Toyman legacy.\n\nThis retirement proved to be tragically short, as not long after Winslow put some of his toys on display (a suggestion by Superman), the entire museum exhibition was completely wrecked. Sightings reported this to be the work of a man in blue tights flying at great speeds. Thinking he&#39;s been played for a fool by Superman, Schott swore to destroy everything Superman cared about to avenge his life&#39;s work. Eventually it is revealed that the real culprit was [[Bizarro]], in search for the duplicator ray, but by then it was already too late: Schott had already returned to his Toyman ways, murdered Jack Nimball and a hotel door guard in cold blood, and built a giant robot to terrorize the city. Shortly after his defeat, he regained his sanity and remembered what he had done. He shed tears of regret as he was escorted to the police car.\n     \nAfter that incident Winslow&#39;s mental state grew even worse, and while he often made several legitimate attempts to atone for his sins, he would often relapse back into madness.\n\nAfter 1985&#39;s miniseries &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[The Man of Steel (comics)|Man of Steel]]&#39;&#39; miniseries, the Toyman&#39;s history was revised, and the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39;]] version of the character first appeared in &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #13 (January 1988). In this version, Winslow Schott is an unemployed [[United Kingdom|British]] toymaker who blames [[Lex Luthor]] and his company, [[LexCorp]], for being fired from the toy company he is working for. He uses his toymaking talents to seek revenge, which eventually causes him to cross paths with the British hero [[Godiva (comics)|Godiva]], and subsequently, [[Superman]] himself. The Toyman continues to commit various crimes in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], including engaging in [[child abduction]].\n\nThe Toyman later became a much more sinister figure, shaving his head, wearing black and getting advice in his head from \&quot;Mother\&quot;. This was prompted by him being told that a range of Superman [[action figure]]s would not include him as he is not \&quot;edgy\&quot; enough. &lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; Vol 2 #84&lt;/ref&gt; While this seems to begin as a pose of what he thought people expect of a villain, it rapidly became a genuine [[psychotic break]]. While in this state he abducted and later murdered Adam Morgan, the son of &#39;&#39;[[Daily Planet]]&#39;&#39; reporter [[Cat Grant]]. Adam and several other children captured by Toyman tried to escape, but Schott found out and stabbed Adam to death for being the leader of the group. This caused Schott to develop a hatred of children, as he blamed them for not appreciating his toys. At the time, Schott showed no remorse for what he had done. When Cat Grant later confronted him in prison he cruelly told her \&quot;You were a bad mommy. I&#39;m glad I killed your son.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; Vol 2 #85&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Toyman later seemingly recovered, and Superman showed him that children did appreciate old-fashioned toys, arranging parole in an [[orphanage]]; it was later revealed, however, that this was all a [[hallucination]] caused when [[Zatanna]] attempts to cure him and he had, in fact, returned to child abduction. He appeared after JLA: Crisis of Conscience where [[Zatanna]] reveals she mind-wiped him. She and Superman go after him. Zatanna is bound and gagged by him, but freed by Superman; however, Toyman escaped.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventures of Superman&#39;&#39; #644 (November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWinslow was seen in &#39;&#39;[[Lex Luthor: Man of Steel]]&#39;&#39;  as a criminal released by Lex Luthor&#39;s aide Mr. Orr to deploy his genetically engineered hero Hope &lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Lex Luthor: Man of Steel&#39;&#39; #3&lt;/ref&gt;, but she almost kills the villain, until Superman saved him. &lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Lex Luthor: Man of Steel&#39;&#39; #4&lt;/ref&gt; Toyman was as well as in the &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]: [[Villains United]]&#39;&#39; special, preparing for the [[Blackgate Penitentiary|Blackgate]] Prison break by lacing the dinner stew with Venom and Velocity 9 to increase the prisoners&#39; strength, speed, and aggression. Unfortunately, some guards also ate the drugged stew and fought the superheroes who showed up to stop the criminals.\n\nHe was later seen as a member of the [[Injustice League]] in the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League|Justice League of America]] Wedding Special&#39;&#39;.\n\nToyman&#39;s history was later revised in &#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #865, by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Jesus Merino]]. Winslow Schott tells [[Jimmy Olsen]] that he was a toymaker who lived with his wife Mary. When a businessman offered to buy his shop to expand the number of children his toys can reach, he refused. When Mary was killed in a car accident a few weeks later, Schott agreed to the purchase. However, the businessman lied and gave his technologically advanced toy plans to arms manufacturers. Schott proceeded to bomb the business with an explosive [[teddy bear]]. A twist at the end of the story reveals that Mary was just one of his first robotic creations.\n\nFollowing his first confrontation with Superman, Schott met the [[Prankster (comics)|Prankster]] for the first time.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The Prankster is a cruel, callous man who commits crimes \&quot;because it&#39;s fun\&quot;. He repeatedly asked Schott to \&quot;team up\&quot;, but Schott refused.\n\nSchott reveals to Jimmy that the Toyman who killed Adam Grant was a robot created by Schott to replace him in the event that he was ever incarcerated and that a glitch in the robot&#39;s programming resulted in it developing a personality, (and later a hatred of children), and that Schott&#39;s repeated attempts to contact the robot resulted in it suffering from delusions of \&quot;Mother\&quot;. This was confirmed in &#39;&#39;Superman Secret Files 2009&#39;&#39;, although Jimmy initially expressed doubt that Schott was telling the truth.\n\nIn the 1997 &#39;&#39;Speed Force Special&#39;&#39;, the [[Max Mercury]] story &#39;&#39;Child&#39;s Play&#39;&#39;, set in 19th century [[New York City]], featured the Schott Toy Company run by Archimedes Schott, a crooked businessman who resembles Winslow. Any relationship between them is unknown.\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Supergirl]]&#39;&#39; series, while in [[Arkham Asylum]], Toyman is visited by Cat Grant (whose son Adam was murdered) and Supergirl. Cat interrogates him about children who have been kidnapped with dolls left behind. Toyman claims he is innocent and the robotic dolls attack him. Supergirl saves him and gets him to medical care. When Cat return home, she is confronted by a villain called [[Dollmaker (comics)#Anton Schott|the Dollmaker]]. He identifies himself as &#39;&#39;&#39;Anton Schott&#39;&#39;&#39; implying that he is somehow related to Toyman.&lt;ref name=sg58&gt;&#39;&#39;Supergirl&#39;&#39; (vol. 5) #58 (January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Dollmaker eventually reveals himself to be the abandoned son of Winslow, who has been kidnapping children and using macabre experiments in order to turn them into slaves. He tells Cat that he wants her to become his new mother, and that he wishes to serve as a replacement for her murdered son, but Cat violently rejects him. With her gag temporarily removed, Cat is able to call Supergirl for help, and the two are able to defeat Dollmaker and free the children he had enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Supergirl&#39;&#39; (vol. 5) #59 (February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Jack Nimball===\nIn the 1970s, a man named &#39;&#39;&#39;Jack Nimball&#39;&#39;&#39; assumes the identity of the second Toyman during a period in which Schott retires from his criminal career and first appeared in &#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #432 (February 1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 158 |quote = Writer Cary Bates and artist Curt Swan gave Superman all the &#39;fun&#39; he could handle with the savvy new Toyman in &#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #432.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nimball wore a [[jester]] costume and used a similar modus operandi to the original Toyman. However, this version of Toyman proved short-lived. Schott killed Nimball with a mechanical toy bird and resumed his criminal career in &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #305 (November 1976). This Toyman&#39;s only other appearances were in &#39;&#39;Action&#39;&#39; #454&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #454&lt;/ref&gt; and &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #299.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #299&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nNimball appears as one of Schott&#39;s androids in &#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #865.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Action Comics #865\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #865&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe version of the Toyman who appears in &#39;&#39;[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]&#39;&#39; was based on Nimball.\n\nIn 2011 [[Mattel]] released a DC Universe Classics 6\&quot; Toyman figure based on the Jack Nimball version of the character. On the back, though, the character is labeled as Winslow Percival Schott.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oafe.net/yo/dcuc18_tm.php OAFE - DC Universe Classics 18: Toyman review]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Hiro Okamura===\n&#39;&#39;&#39;Hiro Okamura&#39;&#39;&#39; is a teenage mechanical genius from [[Japan]] first appearing as Toyman in [[Superman vol. 2|&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; vol. 2]], #177 (February 2002) by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Ed McGuinness]].  He shows up in Metropolis in a giant [[Super Robot]] fighting [[Metallo]], claiming the cyborg&#39;s equally-giant body was based on material stolen from his grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #177&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHe later becomes an ally to Superman and [[Batman]]. In the &#39;&#39;[[Superman/Batman]]&#39;&#39; series, he aids the two in destroying a [[kryptonite]] meteor that threatens the Earth.  He strikes a deal with Batman to provide him with various technological implements (&#39;&#39;Superman/Batman&#39;&#39; #7). Okamura uses more technologically advanced devices than the traditionally-constructed contrivances Schott uses and his work is largely whimsical in nature. Many of his inventions are inspired by [[anime]] and [[manga]], including giant [[mecha]] (notably his giant Composite Batman-Superman robot).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman/Batman&#39;&#39; #5&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOkamura appears only a few times in the &#39;&#39;Superman/Batman&#39;&#39; comic book, and his activities are limited to Japan. Winslow Schott remains active as the Toyman in the United States.  In the [[Sam Loeb]]-penned memorial issue &#39;&#39;Superman/Batman&#39;&#39; #26, Okamura fakes his own kidnapping at the hands of Schott, forcing [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] to search through his complex to save his life. Realizing his loneliness, Superboy and Robin extend their friendship to the boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Okamura joins Robin and the other [[Teen Titans]] at [[Titans Tower]] for Superboy&#39;s funeral, clutching a Superboy [[action figure]].\n\nIn &#39;&#39;Superman/Batman&#39;&#39; #45, he offers to assist the duo in their quest to rid the world of [[Kryptonite]], using spider-like [[nanobot]]s to collect Kryptonite molecules in the air.

The Marionette uses a black-and-yellow color scheme and has several strings connected to its joints that give it the appearance of being operated from above. He attacks Hawkman and Hawkgirl in their museum using toy fighter planes and a gigantic Nimball Marionette, blowing up their museum and leaving the duo for dead,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice&#39;&#39; #3-4&lt;/ref&gt; though they survive the attack.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice&#39;&#39; #6&lt;/ref&gt; Toyman&#39;s city is shown to resemble a fun house and is mainly populated by children and families.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice&#39;&#39; #9&lt;/ref&gt; When the Justice League storm the Hall of Doom, the Marionette attacks the League as a whole instead of any particular target, but is nonetheless destroyed in the attack.

This version is depicted as an insane man who wears an ever-smiling mask similar to a doll&#39;s head, which he is never seen without, and armed with toy-like weapons including a giant superball that can smash concrete and an \&quot;inescapable\&quot; bubble-blower. In this continuity, Winslow Schott Jr. is the son of a kindly toymaker who spent his days in his father&#39;s shop watching him make toys. Winslow Schott Sr. dreamed of building a toy factory, but lack of capital prevented it. Infamous Metropolis mob boss [[Bruno Mannheim]] offered to bankroll Schott to build the toy factory while secretly using it as a front for a [[numbers game|numbers racket]] behind Schott&#39;s back. When the police uncovered the scheme, the gangsters fled, leaving the elder Schott to be framed for running the operation and falsely imprisoned for ten years on [[embezzlement]] charges. Schott eventually died in prison before he could be paroled while Winslow was left on his own and spent several years in abusive and neglectful [[foster care|foster home]]s. By the time he reached adulthood, Winslow became mentally ill. Making use of his natural aptitude for mechanics, he decided to make up for his ruined childhood by terrorizing the world and stealing money to amass his own personal fortune. Toyman appears in two episodes: \&quot;Fun and Games\&quot; and \&quot;Obsession\&quot;. His plans revolved around Darci, a lifelike android created to be his companion, but he also sought revenge against Mannheim for wronging his father and Superman for foiling his schemes. He was seemingly killed in \&quot;Obsession\&quot;, though he continued to make appearances in other DCAU projects.

After Superman and Static confronted Toyman, Darci betrayed him and tried to escape, only to discover that he had implanted a fail-safe device programmed to have the nanites destroy her if she ever did. Darci melted while Toyman was taken to jail.\n** In the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Hereafter\&quot;, Toyman (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]) became a member of the [[Superman Revenge Squad]]. During their attack on Metropolis, he used an experimental machine designed to resemble a giant toy robot capable of firing energy blasts from its \&quot;chest\&quot;. Toyman first targeted innocent bystanders before trying to blast Superman. When Toyman tried to kill [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]], Superman shielded them from the blast; leading to everyone, including Toyman, to believe that he had been vaporized. It was later revealed that Superman had been sent to an apocalyptic future before he eventually made his way back to the present to prevent the catastrophe with the help of a reformed [[Vandal Savage]].\n** In &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39;, Toyman (voiced again by Bud Cort) became a member of [[Gorilla Grodd|Grodd]]&#39;s new [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]].

He faced off against Batman and Superman with his weaponized toys and high-tech punching gloves, only to get knocked out by bombs. He should not be confused with &#39;&#39;&#39;[[List of The Batman characters#Toymaker|Toymaker]]&#39;&#39;&#39;, another character created specifically for the show and who shares his toy-based [[Modus operandi|M.O.]]\n* Toyman appears in the &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Battle of the Superheroes!\&quot;, voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].

He is only referred to once as \&quot;a toyman\&quot; in passing on-screen.\n** A later episode featured a childlike character named Toyman (played by [[Grant Shaud]]) who abducted children via toys that teleported them to his hideout underneath a fast food restaurant. His real identity is &#39;&#39;&#39;Harold Kripstly&#39;&#39;&#39;. After Lois Lane was accidentally abducted by one of Harold&#39;s toys, she was able to attract Superman&#39;s attention, allowing him to save Lois and apprehend Harold.\n\n&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chris Gauthier as Toyman.jpg|220px|thumbnail|right|[[Chris Gauthier]] as Toyman in &#39;&#39;[[Smallville]]&#39;&#39;.]] --&gt;\n* Toyman appeared three times in &#39;&#39;[[Smallville]].&#39;&#39; In the fourteenth episode of the show&#39;s eighth season, \&quot;Requiem\&quot;, portrayed by [[Chris Gauthier]], Winslow Schott is depicted as a toymaker and former [[Queen Industries]] employee with a grudge against [[Justice League (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]]. He was a scientific inventor at [[S.T.A.R. Labs|STAR Labs]] who was hired by Oliver to work for Queen Industries. A great mind, though a bit eccentric, he expressed his individuality by bringing toys to work. However, he went too far when he began putting explosives in them, which lead to his immediate termination from the company. He is later revealed to be working for [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]], disfigured, partially crippled, and hiding in a mobile base. He speaks to Luthor through a camera and microphone concealed in a wooden doll&#39;s head, and used toys such as an exploding [[Newton&#39;s cradle]], knockout gas-filled [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|Mylar]] [[balloon]]s, and an explosive [[cymbal]]-clanging [[monkey]]. After he failed twice to kill Oliver, he escaped police custody. Oliver destroyed Lex&#39;s mobile base with one of Toyman&#39;s toys in order to frame Schott, which forced him to become a fugitive. While [[Clark Kent]] referred to him as \&quot;Toyman\&quot;, Schott was mostly referred to as Toymaker and \&quot;Toyboy\&quot;. In the season nine episode, \&quot;Echo\&quot;, referred to as Toyman by himself, Clark, Chloe Sullivan, and the &#39;&#39;[[Daily Planet]]&#39;&#39;, Schott attempted to test Clark by saving a group of hostages he had kidnapped from a bomb, which Clark succeeded in. Later in the episode, he attempted to kill Oliver once more after being framed for Lex&#39;s demise. After Schott is apprehended and faced with solitary confinement, [[Tess Mercer]] visited Schott in jail to give him [[Metallo|John Corben]]&#39;s [[Kryptonite]]-powered heart to study. This episode also featured an [[android (robot)|android]] version of Schott. Toyman makes his final appearance in &#39;&#39;Smallville&#39;&#39;{{&#39;}}s penultimate episode \&quot;Prophecy\&quot;. Despite still being in jail, he created Marionette Ventures, an organization composed of Metallo, [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Roulette]], Dark Archer, [[Black Manta]], [[Captain Cold]] and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] that worked to control Smallville&#39;s water front properties. Toyman was approached by a brainwashed Courtney Whitmore and used her to do his organization&#39;s bidding.

More than a decade prior to the series, Winslow Schott tried to kill his boss, Chester Dunholz, with a bomb disguised as a gift for supposedly stealing his projects. Dunholz survived, but six innocents were killed instead. After learning what happened, his son Winslow \&quot;Winn\&quot; Schott Jr. (portrayed by [[Jeremy Jordan (actor, born 1984)|Jeremy Jordan]]) never forgave him for giving in to his rage. After Schott escaped from prison in the present, he attempted to kill Dunholz again, with Winn by his side after he forced him to join, before ultimately being apprehended by Supergirl. In the episode \&quot;[[List of Supergirl episodes#ep56|Schott Through the Heart]],\&quot; Schott passed away, but his funeral is disrupted by a bomb in his casket. In the episode \&quot;Back from the Future\&quot; Pt. 2, Winn encountered a digital conscious of his father, who begged his son to let him help stop a villainous doppelganger of Winn. He reluctantly allowed him to help. Once Winn entered the code to stop his evil counterpart, both Schott and the alternate Winn&#39;s consciousnesses are deleted.\n** \&quot;Schott Through the Heart\&quot; also introduced a &#39;&#39;&#39;Toywoman&#39;&#39;&#39; in &#39;&#39;&#39;Jacqueline Nimball&#39;&#39;&#39; (portrayed by [[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]]), a female version of Jack Nimball.

After he was freed from a prison transport by Brainiac 5 on Lex Luthor&#39;s behalf, this Toyman attempted to frame Winn for terrorism in the future by killing [[Acrata|Andrea Rojas]] with robotic [[white tiger]]s. While Supergirl and the DEO fought off the tigers, Winn confronted his villainous counterpart. Toyman was killed when he activated the dead man switch to a bomb he made, but he used Obsidian Tech lenses to upload himself into the D.E.O.&#39;s computers at the last minute in order to invade the internet. With help from a digital copy of his dad&#39;s conscious, Winn hacked the system and deleted both of the Toymen&#39;s consciousnesses. As he had joined the [[Legion of Super-Heroes|Legion]] by this time, Winn changed his legionnaire codename from \&quot;Computer Lad\&quot; to \&quot;Toyman\&quot; in his father&#39;s memory and to do good in \&quot;Toyman&#39;s\&quot; name.\n\n===Film===\n* In the unproduced screenplay for &#39;&#39;[[Batman in film#Batman vs. Superman|Batman vs. Superman]]&#39;&#39;, Toyman makes a brief appearance as a reformed criminal that Batman interrogates and tortures in order to locate [[Joker (character)|Joker]]. When they are attacked by one of the Joker&#39;s deadly gadgets, Batman narrowly escapes, leaving Toyman to be caught in an explosion. His fate isn&#39;t revealed in the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://es.scribd.com/doc/107909181/Batman-vs-Superman-Asylum-screenplay-For-research-purposes-only |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222194832/https://es.scribd.com/doc/107909181/Batman-vs-Superman-Asylum-screenplay-For-research-purposes-only |archive-date=2015-12-22 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Toyman appears in &#39;&#39;[[Superman: Doomsday]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. Like most of the characters in this film, his appearance differs from that of the [[DC animated universe|DCAU]] Toyman and he is portrayed in a more deranged and unkempt form with a goth-like form. In the movie, Toyman appears after Superman dies during a fight with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. Toyman (referred to in this movie as Winslow P. Schott) first uses a giant spider-like robot to hold a school bus full of children hostage after he robs a bank. After a secret clone of Superman defeats him, he attempts to go [[fugitive|on the lam]]. Although police do recapture him, he kills a four-year-old girl off screen during the capture. Upon hearing the news, the Superman clone angrily takes Toyman from the police outside the police department and flies straight up into the sky. Toyman says that he has rights and had nothing to say to which the Superman clone responded with \&quot;How about good-bye?\&quot; and suddenly drops him to his death from high above the city. Toyman lands on a police car onscreen and his death marks the beginning of the Superman clone&#39;s harsher stance on crime than the real Superman.\n* The Hiro Okamura version of Toyman appears in &#39;&#39;[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by Calvin Tran. He helps Superman and Batman into finding a way to stop the Kryptonite Meteor. His result being a ship that resembles [[Composite Superman]]. He is shown to be highly intelligent in the fields of science and technology and is stated to have an [[I.Q.]] of 210. He is also alluded to be hyper-sexually and inappropriately behaving towards [[Power Girl]], who avoids his presence; at one point, when [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] arrive at his base, Power Girl says that she&#39;ll wait outside and when they go inside, Toyman tells them to tell Power Girl that he&#39;s sorry about the x-ray goggles as he takes the broken goggles off. In another instance, when asked if his rocket can stop the meteor, he retorts, \&quot;Does Power Girl have big---?\&quot; before Batman abruptly cuts him off.\n* The Jack Nimball version of Toyman appears in the [[direct-to-video]] [[animated film]] &#39;&#39;[[JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Tom Gibis]]. He appears as a member of the Legion of Doom. In this version, he is actually a living wooden doll like his &#39;&#39;Justice&#39;&#39; version. In the future, his history is forgotten as his body is labeled \&quot;Unknown Totem.\&quot;\n* The Jack Nimball version of Toyman appears in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League vs. Teen Titans]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Steve Blum]]. He&#39;s the member of [[the Legion of Doom]] and he fights the Justice League along with Lex Luthor, Cheetah, Solomon Grundy and Weather Wizard in Metropolis and after the battle they were sent to jail.\n* The Jack Nimball version of Toyman made a cameo in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Dark: Apokolips War]]&#39;&#39;.\n\n===Video games===\n* Toyman appears in the &#39;&#39;[[DC Universe Online]]&#39;&#39; video game, voiced by [[Matt Hislope]].\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate]]&#39;&#39; upon completing the Detective Case called \&quot;Ground Zero\&quot;, it is revealed that the Toyman was an inmate within [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] until he was blackmailed by someone outside the prison (implied to be Amanda Waller), who smuggled in an explosive bracelet and attached it to his arm. It is stated that Toyman was killed when he tried to remove the bracelet, but this is likely a continuity error considering this game takes place before the events of &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham City]]&#39;&#39; unless there are different Toymen existing in this universe.\n* Toyman appears as a playable character in &#39;&#39;[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Nolan North]].\n* Toyman appears as a playable character in &#39;&#39;[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Corey Burton]].\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Toyman appears in issue 2 of the &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39; comics. The Hiro Omakura version also appears.\n* The Hiro Okamura version of Toyman appears in the &#39;&#39;Catwoman: Queen of Thieves&#39;&#39; podcast.&lt;ref&gt;http://pendantaudio.com/catwoman.php{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not refer to him as Toyman but, according to the show, he had helped Catwoman steal things by inventing devices.\n* Toyman is featured in several segments of &#39;&#39;[[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Seth Green]]. He is mostly seen with the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Superman enemies]]\n* [[Killer toys]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://superman.nu/wiki/index.php/Toyman Supermanica entry on the pre-Crisis Toyman]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The seventeenth of the &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; theatrical animated short series would be released.
