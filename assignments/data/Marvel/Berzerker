The characters are usually depicted as being associated with the [[X-Men]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]], they were named after the [[Morlock|subterranean race of the same name]] in [[H. G. Wells]]&#39; novel &#39;&#39;[[The Time Machine]]&#39;&#39;. They first appeared as a group in &#39;&#39;[[The Uncanny X-Men]]&#39;&#39; #169 (May [[1983 in comics|1983]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caliban (Marvel Comics)|Caliban]] appeared prior to that, but he was not yet a member of the Morlocks.\n\nThe Morlocks were depicted as an underground society (both [[Underground living|literally]] and [[Underground society|figuratively]]) of outcast mutants living as [[mole people|tunnel dwellers]] in the [[sewerage|sewer]]s, abandoned tunnels, and [[List of closed New York City Subway stations|abandoned subway lines]] beneath [[New York City]]. The Morlocks were composed of mutant misfits, especially those mutants who, because of physical mutations or other conspicuous manifestations of their mutant genetics, were unable to pass as human in normal society. Subjected to hate, fear, and disgust from human society due to their \&quot;deformed\&quot; appearances, dangerous mutations, or otherwise [[outcast (person)|outcast]] or misfit statuses, most of the Morlocks viewed humans (and even more mainstream mutants such as the X-Men) with distrust and anger, and they occasionally committed criminal or antisocial acts upon the above-ground human society.\n\nDue to a series of tragedies, the original Morlocks no longer reside in subterranean New York City (except [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], who was one of the original Morlocks as a child), although a violent splinter cell [[Gene Nation]] and a comparable group called &#39;&#39;&#39;Those Who Live in Darkness&#39;&#39;&#39; have emerged. Similar groups, called Morlocks by readers and/or the X-Men themselves, have appeared under [[Chicago]] and [[London]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], she formed the Morlocks by first recruiting [[Caliban (Marvel Comics)|Caliban]], and then using his power to track down other mutants who were unable to integrate into normal society. The Morlocks initially [[squatting|squatted]] in a network of abandoned, interconnected tunnels beneath [[Manhattan]], which had originally been built as [[Cold War]] [[bomb shelter]]s and then forgotten.&lt;ref name=\&quot;UX170\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #170 (June 1983). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe X-Men were alerted to the existence of the Morlocks when their leader Callisto kidnapped [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and intended to make him her mate.&lt;ref name=\&quot;X-Men 169\&quot;/&gt; This brought [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] to challenge Callisto to a duel for leadership of the Morlocks. Victorious, Storm&lt;ref name=\&quot;UX170\&quot;/&gt; orders an end to their attacks on normal humans,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #171. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; but she does not assume leadership of the Morlocks full-time. Against her wishes, several Morlocks later kidnap the child superheroes [[Power Pack]] so that they could be raised by the Morlock Annalee, who had lost her own children. When Callisto discovers what was going on, she forces Annalee to let them go. They promise to return in the future to keep her company.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #195 (July 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA majority of the Morlocks are slaughtered by [[Mister Sinister]]&#39;s [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] in the \&quot;[[Mutant Massacre]]\&quot;. Most of the survivors move on to join [[Gene Nation]], having lived in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|pocket dimension]] led by [[Mikhail Rasputin]]. [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] instead becomes a ward of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]. Other survivors include [[Erg (comics)|Erg]] and [[Beautiful Dreamer (Marvel Comics)|Beautiful Dreamer]] (whose whereabouts were unknown until [[Decimation (comics)|\&quot;Decimation\&quot;]]), [[Thornn]], (who would join [[X-Corporation]]), and Caliban.\n\nIt is later revealed that many of the Morlocks were actually failed experiments of the [[Dark Beast]], although he made certain that they didn&#39;t remember being tampered with, however Mister Sinister recognized that the Morlocks were based on his own genetic studies (which the Dark Beast learned from the Sinister of his reality), and that&#39;s why he ordered the Marauders to kill the entire underground society.\n\nA new group called the Tunnel Rats which also calls itself \&quot;Those Who Live in Darkness\&quot; have inhabited the sewer tunnels just below the surface of Mutant Town/[[District X]]. &#39;&#39;District X&#39;&#39; writer [[David Hine]] claims to never have intended this group to have any ties to the original Morlocks.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;District X&#39;&#39; #8-12. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the \&quot;[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]\&quot; storyline, some of the remaining powered Morlocks sought out asylum at the X-Mansion.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Generation M&#39;&#39; #4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; There were some Morlocks that remained underground under Marrow&#39;s protection.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men: The 198&#39;&#39; #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the \&quot;[[X-Men: Endangered Species|Endangered Species]]\&quot; storyline, Masque and the Morlocks with him began their search for Magneto where they had some future-telling diaries with them where one of them states that Magneto is still a mutant in light of M-Day.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #487-491. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAt the time when the Terrigen Cloud was loose on Earth infecting mutants with M-Pox since the \&quot;[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]\&quot; storyline, the number of mutants that are living underground had increased. In addition to these mutants, Callisto showed sympathy towards the humans who sought out refuge from the global landscape. As a way to live out the dream of Professor X, this unified society of humans and mutants lived together as the New Morlocks.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; Vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The Morlock are further decimated by the Mauraders, but Cyclops helps the Chechnyan government expel rebels in exchange for a Morlock sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Uncanny X-men&#39;&#39; Vol 5. #15.

One known Morlock member was [[Fatale (Marvel Comics)|Artemis]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Factor X&#39;&#39; #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter the fall of Apocalypse, a trail of escaped mutants from the Breeding Pens lead the X-Men underground, they encountered a group of scared, orphaned children called the Morlocks. The X-Men offered to help bring them out of hiding in the sewers, but the Morlocks lashed out at them for fear of being locked up and thrown back into cages by the X-Men, now mutant-hunting officers of the newly restored human government. The X-Men emerged victorious and the Morlocks were brought back to the [[X-Mansion#Age of Apocalypse|Xavier Institute]] where they were detained.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse&#39;&#39; #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe Morlocks in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe have a more sophisticated underground living situation than the mainstream Morlocks, including at least one mutant with energy-generating powers to provide electricity, [[hydroponics|hydroponic]] gardens to provide or supplement their food supply, and external air-exchange vents.\n\nIn [[Ultimate X-Men]] #80 Nightcrawler saves the Morlock named [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]], who was outnumbered while fighting the [[Friends of Humanity]] and the police. Other members shown as of issue #82 are [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], [[Callisto (comics)#Ultimate Callisto|Callisto]], Sparks and [[Sunder (comics)|Sunder]] (who was the leader). After a fight with the X-Men (who were trying to rescue [[Toad (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Toad]]), the Morlocks elected Nightcrawler as their new leader. In #90 [[Mister Sinister#Ultimate Marvel|Mister Sinister]] finishes his 10 mutant kills at the Morlock base. His kills include [[Leech (comics)#Ultimate Leech|Leech]] and [[Warren Worthington III#Ultimate Angel|Angel]].\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\n* In &#39;&#39;[[X2 (film)|X2]]&#39;&#39;, a file named \&quot;Morlocks\&quot; appears on the desktop of [[William Stryker|Stryker]]&#39;s computer.\n* The Morlocks appear in &#39;&#39;[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]&#39;&#39;, though never mentioned by that name. Instead, they are referred to as &#39;&#39;&#39;The Omegas&#39;&#39;&#39;. Callisto is still the leader (she possessed Caliban&#39;s mutant sensory ability and Quicksilver&#39;s speed), but other members (including [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]], [[Glob Herman]], [[Phat (comics)|Phat]], [[Psylocke]], [[Quill (comics)|Quill]]/[[Quentin Quire|Kid Omega]], and [[Spike (Marvel Comics)|Spike]]) are pulled from other parts of The X-Men universe. [[Leech (comics)#Film|Leech]] also appears in the film, with no apparent connection to The Omegas.\n\n===Music===\n* The Northern California [[thrash metal]] band Hatchet have a song called \&quot;Morlock&#39;s Tomb\&quot; based on the characters from [[X-Men]].\n\n===Television===\n* The Morlocks appear in &#39;&#39;[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39;. Its members are Annalee, Ape, Caliban, Callisto, Erg, Glowworm, Leech, Masque, Mole, Plague, Scaleface, Sunder, Tar Baby, and Tommy. They first appear in \&quot;Captive Hearts\&quot; where the Morlocks captured [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey in other media#X-Men|Jean Grey]]. The X-Men led by [[Storm in other media#X-Men|Storm]] then came to get Jean and Cyclops back. In the end after a duel between Storm and Callisto, not only did the X-Men get Cyclops and Jean back, Storm also gained leadership of the Morlocks. Several of the Morlocks would have subsequent cameos outside of the sewers (an example being \&quot;Sanctuary\&quot;). They would have a major role to play in the episode \&quot;Out of the Past\&quot; and were last seen in \&quot;Have Yourself a Morlock Little X-Mas\&quot;.\n* The Morlocks have appeared in the &#39;&#39;[[X-Men: Evolution]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;X-Treme Measures.\&quot; The members of the Morlocks represented include Caliban, Callisto, Cybelle, and Scaleface. The series also introduced the Morlock characters Facade (a mutant boy with camouflage powers who can blend with his surroundings), Lucid (a mutant with X-Ray vision who is voiced by [[Lee Tockar]]), and Torpid (a mute mutant little girl with a paralyzing touch coming from her large hands). Unlike their comic counterparts, they have no facial reconstructions as bestowed by Masque (who is not featured in this series), although some are naturally ugly due to their mutations. The Morlocks first appear attacking a beverage factory because something in the drinks is poisonous to mutants. It leaked into the tunnels, causing some of the unnamed members to fall ill. [[Spyke]] later joined them to protect the weaker Morlocks. In the episode \&quot;Uprising,\&quot; Spyke protects the Morlocks and convinces them not to stay hidden. The Morlocks later help Spyke and the X-Men fight Duncan Matthews and his friends when they start attacking mutants.\n* The Morlocks have appeared in &#39;&#39;[[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|The Gifted]]&#39;&#39; season two episode \&quot;coMplications\&quot;, led by their leader Erg.\n\n===Video games===\n* In the video game &#39;&#39;[[X-Men Legends]]&#39;&#39;, the [[X-Men]] must go on a mission to rescue [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] from the Morlocks. Marrow is the leader of the militant [[Gene Nation#Video games|Gene Nation]] which is represented as a faction of Morlocks. Healer also plays an important part in the game as he sells health and energy potions to the player. Aside from Marrow and Healer are a substantial number of unnamed Morlock Grunts, Morlock Claws, Morlock Goths, Morlock Lieutenants, Morlock Giants, Morlock Leviathans, and Morlock Blades.\n* In &#39;&#39;[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]&#39;&#39;, the Morlocks have been brainwashed by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and [[Mister Sinister]], leading Marrow as a known survivor where she has joined [[Moira MacTaggert]] and others in helping rescue refugees.\n* The Morlock Tunnels appear in the video game &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]&#39;&#39;. The Morlock Tunnels come under attack by the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe Morlocks were ranked #14 on a listing of Marvel Comics&#39; monster characters in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/marvel/250132/marvels-31-best-monsters/page/0/1|title= Marvel&#39;s 31 Best Monsters|first= Marc|last= Buxton|date= October 30, 2015|publisher= [[Dennis Publishing|Den of Geek]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224818/http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/marvel/250132/marvels-31-best-monsters/page/0/1|archivedate= March 12, 2017|url-status= dead|df= mdy-all|quote= The Morlocks might seem like just another faction of mutants, but in the X-verse, homo superior just doesn\u2019t come more Halloweeny than this crew of sewer dwelling monstrosities.|access-date= September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Morlocks Morlocks] at Marvel.com\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Morlocks_(Earth-616) Morlocks] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/morlocks/4060-3191/ Morlocks] at Comic Vine\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184821/http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/pov/showquestion.asp?faq=6&amp;fldAuto=53 Uncannyxmen.net feature on Morlocks]\n\n{{X-Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morlocks (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:X-Men]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret societies]]\n[[Category:Fictional organizations in Marvel Comics]]&quot;</span>
