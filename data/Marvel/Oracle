The Shi&#39;ar Empire (or [[Imperium]]), is a vast collection of alien species, cultures, and worlds situated close to the [[Skrull]] and [[Kree]] Empires. The Shi&#39;ar are one of the three main extraterrestrial empires depicted in the [[Marvel Universe]], alongside the [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Shi&#39;ar first appearanced in &#39;&#39;[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]&#39;&#39; vol. 1 #97 (February 1976) and were created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |pages=324\u2013325}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Biology==\nThe Shi&#39;ar are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]&lt;ref name=\&quot;Astonish57\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Astonishing X-Men&#39;&#39; Vol 3 #57. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[humanoid]]s of [[wikt:avian|avian]] descent; they resemble [[human]]s with [[feather]]ed crests atop their [[head (anatomy)|head]]s in lieu of [[hair]]. Two different styles are common: most Shi&#39;ar, particularly those of the [[aristocracy]], have feathers sprouting in a triangular shape away from the face, one peak on the top of the head and one peak on each side slightly over the shoulder; the other commonly seen \&quot;hairstyle\&quot; is bushy on both sides and very flat on the top.&lt;ref name=ohotmis27&gt;&#39;&#39;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&#39;&#39; Vol 2 #7. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nInternally, they have lightweight and hollow bones, and on their forearms there are still some vestigial feathers left of wings that were lost over millions of years of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Avengers379\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; #379. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The average Shi&#39;ar can lift 1 ton in Earth-like gravity and has far greater stamina than the average human. Most Shi&#39;ar have no other special abilities, though occasionally a genetic throwback appears possessing wings that allow for flight (an example of  [[atavism]]).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update&#39;&#39; #3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Encyclopedia&#39;&#39; #1.

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Shi&#39;ar conceive their offspring in eggs. They are nurtured in special chambers and the children are referred to as [[hatchling]]s.{{issue|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe Shi&#39;ar have more [[chakras]] than a human.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;A + X&#39;&#39; #15.

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThere have also been Shi&#39;ar who had developed superpowers such as Electron, Rook&#39;shir, Deathcry, Dakari, White Noise and Black Light.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men: Messiah Complex - Mutant Files&#39;&#39; #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained as most of them are members of the Imperial Family and because of Rook&#39;shir, who had transmitted his Phoenix Force manipulation power to his descendants.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Uncanny479\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #479.

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Culture==\n===Language===\nA Shi&#39;ar \&quot;Galaxian\&quot; has stated that have learned nearly every spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #477.

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; and Shi&#39;ar Glorkon dialect.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;All-New X-Men&#39;&#39; #24. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMostly for tactical terms or insults, the Shi&#39;ar insert words of their language into English sentences.{{issue|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Philosophy===\nTraditionally, the Imperium has aggressively absorbed new cultures. [[Warren Ellis]]&#39; 1995 &#39;&#39;[[Starjammers]]&#39;&#39; limited series described the story of the Shi&#39;ar [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|deities]] [[Sharra]] and [[K&#39;ythri]] as a parable which guides the Shi&#39;ar expansionist philosophy to other worlds:\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Sharra and K&#39;ythri are the gods in marriage. The gods who didn&#39;t want to marry, but were forced into it. In marriage they found strength and in strength they found love. That&#39;s what the Shi&#39;ar Imperium does. It marries other cultures. Shotgun weddings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Starjammers&#39;&#39; #1-4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThere are aggressive and violent ancient traditions, such as the Rite of Arin&#39;nn Haelar, which is a battle to the death. This rite can be invoked to settle disagreements and their outcomes are accepted by the Imperium.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; Vol 3 #35. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Their philosophy also impact their court as they don&#39;t recognize insanity.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thanos&#39;&#39; #10. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nX-Men writer [[Ed Brubaker]] compared the Shi&#39;ar to &#39;&#39;[[Star Trek]]&#39;&#39;&#39;s [[Romulan]]s, saying they are \&quot;smart, aggressive, and mean\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=101434 Uncanny in Space - Talking X-Men With Ed Brubaker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015195321/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=101434 |date=2007-10-15 }}, [[Newsarama]], February 12, 2007 (accessed 15 Feb 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Politics===\nThough the empire has grown to include hundreds of thousands of different sentient species and worlds, the Shi&#39;ar race controls and governs the empire. Its central base of power is located on the \&quot;throneworld\&quot; Chandilar, while the Shi&#39;ar homeworld is called Aerie (it is unknown if the planet still exists). The leader of the empire is given the title Majestor (male) or Majestrix (female) and is a [[heredity|hereditary]] position, occupied by members of the royal family of the Shi&#39;ar. Formerly, the Neramani family represented the royal bloodline.&lt;ref name=&#39;ohotmus&#39;&gt;&#39;&#39;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&#39;&#39; #10. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Shi&#39;ar Empire is one of the most advanced and expansive civilizations in the universe, spanning entire [[Galaxy|galaxies]]. It is mainly an economic co-operative, where trade with other galactic powers is its driving force. Not all races have the same rights in the Imperium, as the Shi&#39;ar appear to have a disproportionate influence on its governance.\n\nIt is nominally ruled over by a high council, which has representatives from a large majority of the alien races that exist within the Imperium. However, in practice, the head of the council (the Majestor or Majestrix) exercises strong executive control and can institute policy virtually by decree.\n\nThe leader of the Shi&#39;ar empire is protected by his or her own personal guard called the &#39;&#39;&#39;Imperial Guard&#39;&#39;&#39; which is made up of the most powerful and elite soldiers from throughout the Empire with most of them being Shi&#39;ar and others being from other alien races in the Shi&#39;ar&#39;s jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial Guard is led by a [[praetor]]. The military itself (outside of the Imperial Guard) has been depicted as consisting almost exclusively of Shi&#39;ar personnel, at least in most of the command positions.&lt;ref name=&#39;ohotmus&#39;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #471. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThough having warlike and militaristic ancestry, the Shi&#39;ar Empire has largely occupied the role of peacekeepers in many interstellar affairs. Just to name a few, [[Lilandra Neramani|Empress Lilandra Neramani]] tried to broker peace between the [[Kree|Kree Empire]] and the [[Skrull|Skrull Empire]] to help bring an end to their devastating war: she sought interstellar accord when deciding how to end the threat of the [[Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]], and attempted to avenge the destruction of Tarnax IV, the Skrull throneworld, by [[Galactus]].\n\nHowever, it should also be noted that Empress Lilandra was personally responsible for authorizing the use of the Nega-bomb weapon, devastating the Kree Empire during \&quot;[[Operation: Galactic Storm]],\&quot; and that the Shi&#39;ar were pivotal in the invasion and containment of Earth during the [[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]] event. One of the latest atrocities committed by the Shi&#39;ar was ordering the extermination of [[Jean Grey]]&#39;s family, in an effort to quell any future conflicts with the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] entity.\n\n===Attitude toward the arts===\nThe Shi&#39;ar consider artistic creativity to be a sign of insanity and deviance, as they lack the ability to dream. Shi&#39;ar who have the ability to dream and create do all they can to suppress their impulses. In the past, execution was a common remedy to such &#39;infections&#39;. A race called the Fianden had the ability to cause any Shi&#39;ar to dream; this caused mass catatonia and insanity in most Shi&#39;ar, although a small subset who already are able to dream recover after a brief delay. The Fianden were wiped out in a mass genocide. After they were used to destroy the Fianden, the Shi&#39;ar executed all of the natural dreamers to purge the taint from their bloodlines. Nevertheless, the trait does still emerge periodically, to continued violent repression.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Astonishing X-Men&#39;&#39; Vol 3 #57-58. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Star-Lord&#39;&#39; #8. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fictional race biography==\nAfter leaving their world, the Shi&#39;ar started an intergalactic Empire and forced other cultures in order to become stronger and ruled for millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men&#39;&#39;. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Starjammers&#39;&#39; #4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Such cultures included the Chameloids, Lupaks, Stygians, Strontians, Hodinn, Saurids and many more. When the Shi&#39;ar invaded the homeworld of the Mephitisoids, they declared to bring civilization to the primitive world. However this was a lie and the Mephitisoids had technology almost equal to the Shi&#39;ar. The Shi&#39;ar conquered the peaceful Mephistoids stealing their technology. However, the true history was lost to legend and propaganda.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Avengers379\&quot; /&gt;\n\nWhen the Shi&#39;ar known as Rook&#39;shir was bonded to the Phoenix Force, he became Dark Phoenix and wreaked havoc across Shi&#39;ar Empire. In order to stop him, the first Imperial Guard sent Gladiator after him, who killed him. For years all his descendants were culled, out of fear that one of them might host the Phoenix Force like their ancestor.

In the [[X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong|Phoenix Endsong]] series, a group of Shi&#39;ar tried to eliminate both the Phoenix Force and Jean Grey. Jean, however, escaped their [[suicide bomb]] attack and returned to the White Hot Room to restore herself.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men Phoenix Endsong&#39;&#39; #5.

During his tenure as majestor of the empire, D&#39;Ken killed Vulcan&#39;s mother Katherine Summers (also mother to longtime X-Men [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott]] and [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]]) and made him a slave for most of his adolescent life. Bent on revenge against D&#39;Ken, Vulcan attacks the Empire. Not only that, but within the empire, there is a coup to dethrone Lilandra and return D&#39;Ken to power, with the aid of Deathbird. The X-Men once again team up with their space allies, the [[Starjammers]], to stop both Vulcan and the plot to return rulership of the empire to D&#39;Ken. In the end, Vulcan kills his father, [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]], and D&#39;Ken, and assumes the throne of the Shi&#39;ar Empire for himself, with Deathbird as his queen; Lilandra and the Starjammers now lead a resistance against Vulcan&#39;s rule.

The Shi&#39;ar, contrary to Vulcan&#39;s expectations, are not happy to have an outsider as their ruler. Vulcan is discouraged by this, but Deathbird convinces him that they will come to accept him.&lt;ref name=&#39;xmev1&#39;&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men: Emperor Vulcan&#39;&#39; #1.

However, in the middle of the battle, his ship, the Hammer, is destroyed by the Scy&#39;ar Tal (translates as \&quot;Death to the Shi&#39;ar\&quot;). Vulcan and [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] (still the praetor of his Imperial Guard) attack the leader of the Scy&#39;ar Tal and are easily defeated, whereupon they retreat deeper into Shi&#39;ar space.&lt;ref name=&#39;xmev1&#39;/&gt;\n\nMarvel Girl makes contact with the Eldest Scy&#39;ar Tal and discovers their true origin. The Scy&#39;ar Tal were originally called the M&#39;Kraan. Early in their history, the Shi&#39;ar attacked them, killed a great number of their people, making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi&#39;ar settled on their planet, took the M&#39;Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M&#39;Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, Sharra &amp; K&#39;ythri. The M&#39;Kraan then changed their name to Scy&#39;ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi&#39;ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather&#39;s Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan makes contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceC\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men: Emperor Vulcan&#39;&#39; #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nUnder the ceasefire, the Shi&#39;ar and the Starjammers decide to take out the Finality, thus crippling the Scy&#39;ar&#39;s biggest threat. Once Havok and Vulcan are in position to destroy Finality, the Eldest Scy&#39;ar tries to stop them. Once Vulcan figures out how the Eldest is powered, he severs the connection Eldest has with his brothers, making him powerless. Once the connection is severed, the Scy&#39;ar become disorganized, and the tide of the battle shifts to the Shi`ar. The Shi&#39;ar then proceed to attack both the Scy&#39;ar and the Starjammers. Meanwhile, Vulcan blasts Havok into a sun.\n\nVulcan decides to use Finality to destroy the Scy&#39;ar by using the weapon to place a star in the middle of their fleet. Alex returns and, having absorbed enough power to burn him, decides to end things with Vulcan. While they battle, Rachel and Korvus try, but fail to stop the beacon that will initiate the attack by the Shi&#39;ar. The Shi&#39;ar Imperial Guard end Alex&#39;s battle with Vulcan by appearing with the Starjammers in captivity, threatening to kill them. Before surrendering, Alex destroys Finality. With Alex and the Starjammers in custody Vulcan declares that he will return the Shi&#39;ar Empire to its former glory.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;X-Men: Emperor Vulcan&#39;&#39; #5.

Eventually, Null Space and the Tree of Shadows were discovered by a more pre-historic version of the Shi&#39;ar and the Skrulls, a find that ended in war erupting between the two alien races. The war ranged until one member of the Shi&#39;ar was able to grasp one of the seeds of the Tree. His physiology, fear and belief&#39;s shaped the birth of the most vicious killing machine the universe had ever seen, the first Raptor and while the Skrulls, being shape-shifters, were still able to hold out against the Shi&#39;ar, they eventually were nevertheless slaughtered by Raptor Prime, a creature of instinct and adaptation which quickly learnt to use their enemies shape-shifting abilities as well. It can be assumed that due to the incident with Rook&#39;shir, the Shi&#39;ar then intended to use the seeds of the Tree of Shadows to create an army to unleash Ratha&#39;kon or the Dark Starhawk, a being who would be able to contain and act as a \&quot;predator\&quot; to the Phoenix Force, however, while the Fraternity of Raptors attempted to mimic the Cosmic entity, because of their mechanoid nature, they were unable to unlock much less ascertain the coveted true power of which within their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Countdown: Darkhawk&#39;&#39; #2.
