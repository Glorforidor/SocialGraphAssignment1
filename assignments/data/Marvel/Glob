The Glob was blown into fragments by an explosion.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #129. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Glob's brain later reformed into the Golden Brain. It was used as a weapon by Yagzan and the Cult of Entropy, but was lost by the Entropists in an encounter with the [[Man-Thing]]. The Golden Brain psionically molded itself into an amnesiac blond-haired man. The man was later captured and mutated by Yagzan into a clay form version of the Glob.  It battled the Man-Thing and was reduced to clay again, which smothered Yagzan, killing him.<ref>''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHowever, it was later revealed that the Glob had re-formed and had been enslaved by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. It eventually rebelled against him with the assistance of the Hulk and the Man-Thing.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 1 #197-198. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Glob was then taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody where it was recruited in that organization's [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Paranormal Containment Unit]].<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #2-6.

He transformed into a light-green semi-humanoid being seemingly composed of bog matter and became the second '''Glob'''. It fled to the Florida Everglades, menaced [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and battled the [[Hulk]], who mistook it for the original Glob. It was incinerated by the Man-Thing's touch after it felt fear.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #389. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBoth Globs were monstrous creatures that resembled a semi-solid mass of slime and bog-matter, with superhuman strength, stamina and durability, though both were limited in intelligence and reflexes. The Globs' bodies are difficult to harm, due to their semi-solid build that could absorb physical attacks painlessly.\n\nJoe Timms became the Glob due to exposure to radioactive waste in a swamp bog. As the Golden Brain, he had the ability to materialize a powerful electrically charged duplicate of the Glob and recreate himself as a physically perfect version of his human form.\n\nSumner Beckwith became the Glob when he was injected with an experimental duplicate of the Super-Soldier Formula. Unlike his predecessor, he did not seem to possess quite enough strength to seriously menace the Hulk, spending most of their brief battle on the receiving end of the damage. Before his transformation, he had earned a Ph.D. in genetics and was a skilled geneticist.\n\n==Other characters named Glob==\nThere have been three other characters known as '''Glob''' in the Marvel Universe. These include:\n\n* '''The Glob''', an imaginary flaming monster from ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #88.<ref>http://monsterblog.oneroom.org/meet_the_monsters/glob.html</ref>\n* '''The Glop''', who was originally known as the Glob in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #72.<ref>http://monsterblog.oneroom.org/meet_the_monsters/the_glob.html</ref>\n* '''[[Glob Herman]]''', a student at the [[Xavier Institute student body|Xavier Institute]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe Glob was ranked #31 on a listing of Marvel Comics' monster characters.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/marvel/250132/marvels-31-best-monsters|title= Marvel's 31 Best Monsters|first= Marc|last= Buxton|date= October 30, 2015|publisher= [[Dennis Publishing|Den of Geek]]|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/72pHE6aGZ?url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/marvel/250132/marvels-31-best-monsters|archivedate= September 30, 2018|url-status= live|df= mdy-all|quote= Glob fought the Hulk a few times before Timms was recreated into the being known as the Golden Brain and used as a weapon by the villain Yagzan and the crazed Cult of Entropists}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Glob_%28Joseph_Timms%29 Glob (Joseph Timms)] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Sumner_Beckwith_%28Earth-616%29 Glob (Sumner Beckwith)] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/globtimmshulk.htm|Glob (Joseph Timms)}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/globbeckwith.htm|Glob (Sumner Beckwith)}}\n\n{{Hulk}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Herb Trimpe]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1969]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Miami]]\n[[Category:Fictional gangsters]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Fictional undead]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics demons]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
