The original six characters were [[Black Condor]], [[Doll Man]], the [[Human Bomb]], [[Ray (comics)|Ray]], [[Phantom Lady]], and [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]].&lt;ref name=Companion&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koolman |first1=Mike |last2=Amash |first2=Jim |title=The Quality Companion |date=2011 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490373 |pages=41-47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the characters were created by [[Quality Comics]], they never were gathered in a group before being acquired by DC. The team first appeared in a [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]/[[Justice Society of America]] team-up, which ran in &#39;&#39;Justice League of America&#39;&#39; #107\u2013108 (October\u2013December [[1973 in comics|1973]]), written by [[Len Wein]] and drawn by [[Dick Dillin]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | author-link=Robert Greenberger | contribution=Freedom Fighters | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=131 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[New York City|New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 156 |quote = The annual Justice League-Justice Society get-together resulted in scribe Len Wein and artist Dick Dillin transporting both teams to the alternate reality of Earth-X.

However, this group failed in its attempt to stop the devastation at [[Pearl Harbor]]. All of them but Uncle Sam and Hourman were originally thought killed, but only [[Magno (Quality Comics)|Magno]] actually died.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt; This version of the group was a [[retcon]] and their battle and alleged deaths were depicted in the pages of [[Roy Thomas]]&#39; two books chronicling that era: &#39;&#39;[[All-Star Squadron]]&#39;&#39; and the &#39;&#39;[[Young All-Stars]]&#39;&#39;.\n\nThe DC version of the characters were said to reside on the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel world]] of \&quot;Earth-X\&quot;, where [[Nazi Germany]] eventually won a prolonged [[World War II]] due to a [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] invasion of [[California]] and the development of nuclear weapons by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Freedom Fighters had their own book for fifteen issues from 1976 to 1978,&lt;ref&gt;[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/freedom-fighters/4050-2838/ Freedom Fighters (1976)], &#39;&#39;ComicVine&#39;&#39;.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they crossed over to Earth-1 and were quickly set up by [[Silver Ghost (comics)|Silver Ghost]]. They spend the rest of the series on the run from the law, unable to clear themselves. The series was canceled before the storyline concluded; it was intended to be completed in &#39;&#39;[[Secret Society of Super Villains]]&#39;&#39;, but that too was canceled before the story could be published. This series also introduced the [[Crusaders (DC Comics)|Crusaders]] and reintroduced [[Firebrand (DC Comics)|Firebrand]].\n\nIn addition to the core members of the \&quot;second team\&quot; which were the members seen in the seventies comic book, other Quality heroes joined later: [[Red Bee (comics)|Red Bee]], [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]], [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]], [[Plastic Man]], and [[Max Mercury|Quicksilver]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt;\n\nSince the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], the Freedom Fighters have been based on the main [[DC Universe]] Earth, and were all members of the All-Star Squadron.\n\nYears after the war, a third version of the team surfaced in the 1980s, with the rise of a new age of heroes. The Freedom Fighters, along with the [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawks]] and [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]],  were captured by alien Appellaxians and placed in [[Internment|internment camps]]. They were freed by the new [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].\n\nThe Freedom Fighters regrouped for a brief time, but soon called it quits again when Firebrand was killed in battle with the [[Silver Ghost (comics)|Silver Ghost]].\n\nA fourth version of the team appeared as an auxiliary of the new Justice Society of America. The Human Bomb, Black Condor, and Phantom Lady were later killed by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] in &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; #1. [[Damage (DC Comics)|Damage]] was critically injured, [[Iron Munro]] was absent, and the [[Ray (comics)|Ray]] was captured by the [[Psycho-Pirate]] as part of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]]&#39;s plans.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&#39;&#39;===&lt;!--needs condensing into a summary--&gt;\nA new team of heroes debuted in the limited series &#39;&#39;Crisis Aftermath: The Battle for Bl\u00fcdhaven&#39;&#39;, and later featured as Freedom Fighters members in the miniseries &#39;&#39;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&#39;&#39;, which premiered in July 2006. This team consists of new incarnations of the Phantom Lady, the Ray (Stan Silver), the Human Bomb, Doll Man, Bigfoot, Destroyer and Face. It is part of [[S.H.A.D.E.]], a secret American government agency chartered under the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], led by [[Father Time (DC Comics)|Father Time]]. The new team conducts assassinations and other illegal acts against criminal and terrorist organizations. As issue #1 of &#39;&#39;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&#39;&#39; begins, the team is tasked to capture the revived [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]], who is in the process of forming his own Freedom Fighters team; Sam subsequently recruits the S.H.A.D.E. members to his cause, openly disapproving of their use of deadly force (although they continue to kill people even under Uncle Sam&#39;s guidance).&lt;ref&gt;According to Justin Gray&#39;s July 2006 interview with &#39;&#39;The Kingdom&#39;&#39;, his team&#39;s members will ultimately include: Uncle Sam, Doll Man, Phantom Lady, the Ray, Firebrand, Human Bomb, the Black Condor, and Miss America.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis version of the team is loosely based on notes by [[Grant Morrison]] and written by Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray. Uncle Sam is portrayed as an almost Christ-like figure, returning from the dead, with the new [[Firebrand (DC Comics)|Firebrand]] filling a [[John the Baptist]] role. Father Time is shown as aiding in Senator Frank Knight&#39;s being secretly murdered in the midst of his successful campaign for the Presidency of the U.S. and replaced by a sentient robot double, Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard, who proceeds with an agenda to implant [[RFID]] chips in every U.S. citizen by law and control them to bring chaos to the world through war.\n\n[[Image:Freedomfightersdcu0.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Panel from &#39;&#39;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&#39;&#39; #8. Art by Daniel Acu\u00f1a.]]\n\nIn &#39;&#39;Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters&#39;&#39; #3, a team created by Father Time called [[First Strike (DC Comics)|First Strike]] attacked the Freedom Fighters but not before being stopped by the new Black Condor.\n\nIn #4, Condor manages to weaken First Strike long enough for the Freedom Fighters to fight back. Human Bomb kills one of First Strike&#39;s members, Propaganda, and the team heads back to S.H.A.D.E. headquarters.\n\nIn #5, The Freedom Fighters defeat First Strike, but are taken out by a young woman claiming to be [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]]. While they are being tortured, S.H.A.D.E. headquarters is attacked by a new Red Bee and an old woman claiming to be the real Miss America.\n\nIn #6, the Freedom Fighters defeat the new Miss America with the original&#39;s help, forcing Father Time to retreat.  As he begins \&quot;molting\&quot; into a new body, he gives the order to \&quot;activate the traitor.\&quot;  This turns out to be the Ray, who attacks and kills the new [[Invisible Hood]] and calls down giant reinforcements.\n\nIn #7, The Freedom Fighters face off against the Cosmigods as Uncle Sam calls them. In the midst of the battle the traitorous Ray is confronted by the returning Ray Terrill. As predicted Gonzo turns on the newly rejuvenated Father Time, who proceeds to give Uncle Sam the evidence to prove Gonzo&#39;s true identity. Sam presents the evidence to the world, and seemingly the final battle between First Strike and the Freedom Fighters begins.\n\nIn #8, The Freedom Fighters engage in battle against Gonzo&#39;s metahuman taskforce at the Washington Monument, and quickly gain support from the civilians. The public eye are now seeing them as real heroes, which was later revealed to be part of Father Time&#39;s plan all along. He tricked Gonzo into believing that S.H.A.D.E was against Uncle Sam, while in truth he was preparing the Freedom Fighters to help combat a major threat in the future. Father Time captures Gonzo and turns him into an &#39;Orphan Box&#39; in the shape of a pair of spectacles. He plans to use it against Gonzo&#39;s creator, the Shadow Demons. All of the metahuman taskforce members disappear into the timestream along with Father Time shortly thereafter. A week later, the new President appoints the Freedom Fighters the new directors of S.H.A.D.E.\n\n===Further adventures===\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]&#39;&#39; #38, the Freedom Fighters are seen trying to stop an unplanned nuclear missile launch, initiated by the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]].\n\nIn the new &#39;&#39;Freedom Fighters&#39;&#39; mini-series written by Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Oct07/solicitations.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718084234/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Oct07/solicitations.html |date=July 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Bee is captured by an alien insect swarm and transformed into a human/insect hybrid. At the same time, S.H.A.D.E. has planned to make the Freedom Fighters into media darlings to help increase faith in the government following the [[Amazons Attack|Amazonian]] incident.\n\nUncle Sam, Firebrand, Doll Man, and Human Bomb refuse to go along with the plan and return to the Heartland. For a time, the remaining Freedom Fighters become celebrities, part of a new group called the [[Crusaders (DC Comics)|Crusaders]]. Red Bee later collapses in her apartment and a swarm of insects suddenly rise out of her body.\n\nPhantom Lady, unable to cope with the media attention, goes on a binge spree, culminating in her drunkenly slicing a criminal in half on national television. Stormy is brought to the heartland, where her body is cleaned of toxins by Miss America.\n\nSam and Doll Man recruit the original Doll Man (Darrell Dane) from a micro-environment within the Pentagon. After the head of the Crusaders program, Robbins, tries to kill Red Bee, the Freedom Fighters confront him. It is revealed that Robbins has mental powers that he used to control the Crusaders \u2014 and Stormy \u2014 leading to her binge.\n\nWhile the Crusaders and Freedom Fighters battle, Red Bee is overtaken by her [[insectoid]] side, and uses her pheromones to enslave the Crusaders and Freedom Fighters, and prepares to create a \&quot;hive\&quot; on Earth. Meanwhile, an attempt to cure the Doll Men and several other micro-sized individuals goes horribly wrong, as all of them are merged into a single mutant form. The mutant goes on a rampage until Emma Thompson reaches Lester. Red Bee is cured of her affliction by Langford Terrill, who had gained the powers of [[Neon the Unknown]]. The team then prepares to fight off an invasion by the insectoids. After their victory, the group go their separate ways, but Sam declares that they will be needed when the [[Final Crisis|Crisis]] begins.\n\n===Blackest Night===\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Blackest Night]]&#39;&#39; crossover event, [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] power rings are shown heading toward the graves of [[Phantom Lady]], [[Black Condor]], and [[Human Bomb]], presumably to revive them for use in the interstellar revenant army being assembled. Indeed, at least those three are seen later attacking JSA headquarters along with the undead revenants of the Society&#39;s members. These three Black Lanterns, along with Al Pratt&#39;s undead form, focus on attacking [[Damage (DC comics)|Damage]], though they have little success, continually getting blown up, regenerating and rising again to attack him, until [[Jean Loring]]&#39;s revenant kills him.\n\n===Ongoing series===\n{{One source|date=July 2011}}\nA new ongoing &#39;&#39;Freedom Fighters&#39;&#39; series began in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dccomics.com/dcu/comics/?cm=15561] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811003204/http://dccomics.com/dcu/comics/?cm=15561 |date=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was canceled after only 9 issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dangermart.blogspot.com/2011/05/cancelled-comics-cavalcade-week-freedom.html Review of the final issue.]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===New 52===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC&#39;s continuity. In this new timeline, the Freedom Fighters still inhabit Earth-10, but according to [[Grant Morrison]]&#39;s [[Multiversity]] revision of the concept, Kal-L landed in German territory in 1938. Hitler reverse-engineered the alien technology that the Kryptonian starship incorporated and released Kal-L/Overman on American forces in the 1950s which enabled Nazi Germany to win the Second World War. However, Overman became aware of the evil of his comrades after seeing the massive numbers of deaths of innocent people who didn&#39;t fit into the Nazi ideology. After Hitler died, Overman and his government were able to establish a utopia. The Freedom Fighters still exist as a team of genetically enhanced metahumans thanks to the genius of the Earth-10 [[Doctor Sivana|Dr. Sivana]], but in revised and inclusive composition (Ray is gay, [[Doll Man]] is a [[Jehovah&#39;s Witness]], [[Black Condor]] is an African-American, and [[Phantom Lady]] is [[Romani People|Romani]]). The Freedom Fighters commit various acts of terrorism against Overman&#39;s post-Nazi regime while Overman is in conflict with himself as he still feels guilt over the ethnic and ideological purges of the Hitler-era. In the Freedom Fighters most extreme attack, they drop the Earth-10&#39;s Justice League orbital base on Metropolis, killing millions of people and even further grieving Overman.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n&#39;&#39;New Super-Man&#39;&#39; features a group called The Freedom Fighters of China. Each member of the group is a Chinese version of one of the original Freedom Fighters. They are led by Flying Dragon General (an analog of Uncle Sam); other members include Sunbeam (analog of The Ray), Blue Condor (analog of Black Condor), Ghost Woman (Phantom Lady), Folding Paper Man (Doll Man), and Human Firecracker (Human Bomb).\n\n==Other versions==\n* In the final issue of &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39;, a new Multiverse is revealed, consisting of 52 realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated \&quot;Earth-10\&quot;, X being the Roman Numeral for 10. This new alternate Earth differs from the original pre-Crisis Earth-X. In original continuity, the Freedom Fighters were the only metahumans on the original Earth-X. However, the new Earth-10 is premised on the continued ascendancy of [[Nazi Germany]], which was defeated in the original JLA/JSA/Freedom Fighters crossover. Earth-10 is home to the JLAxis, which consists of Nazi counterparts of the Justice League, who combat an alternate version of the Freedom Fighters.
