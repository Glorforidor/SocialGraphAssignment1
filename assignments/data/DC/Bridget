Directed by [[Eric Radomski]] and [[Bruce Timm]], it is a cinematic stand-alone continuation of &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; and the first original theatrical film produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]].\n\nThe film was written by [[Alan Burnett]], [[Paul Dini]], [[Martin Pasko]], and [[Michael Reaves]]. [[Kevin Conroy]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]], [[Bob Hastings]] and [[Robert Costanzo]] reprise their roles from &#39;&#39;The Animated Series&#39;&#39;, joined by [[Dana Delany]], [[Hart Bochner]], [[Stacy Keach, Jr.]], [[Abe Vigoda]], [[Dick Miller]] and [[John P. Ryan]]. Its story follows Batman as he reconciles with a former lover, [[Andrea Beaumont]], and faces a mysterious vigilante who is murdering [[Gotham City]]&#39;s crime bosses. The plot was inspired by [[Mike W. Barr]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Year Two]]&#39;&#39; comic book [[story arc]], but features an original antagonist, the Phantasm, in place of the [[Reaper (DC Comics)|Reaper]].\n\nOriginally planned for a [[direct-to-video]] release, [[Warner Bros.]] gave &#39;&#39;Mask of the Phantasm&#39;&#39; a theatrical release, condensing its production into a strenuous eight-month schedule. The film was released through the studio&#39;s [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment|Family Entertainment]]&lt;ref name=\&quot;afi\&quot; /&gt; division on December 24, 1993, to positive reviews from critics, who praised the stylized animation, voice performances, story, and music.\n\nDue to the decision to release it in theaters on short notice, &#39;&#39;Mask of the Phantasm&#39;&#39; [[Box office bomb|failed at the box office]]. After its release on home video, it became financially successful. Its success led to two direct-to-video standalone [[sequel]]s, &#39;&#39;[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]&#39;&#39; in 1998 and &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman|Mystery of the Batwoman]]&#39;&#39; in 2003. Until the limited release of &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|Batman: The Killing Joke]]&#39;&#39; in 2016, &#39;&#39;Mask of the Phantasm&#39;&#39; was the only animated &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; film to be given a theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|film|date=December 2019}}\n&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --&gt;\nA young Bruce Wayne meets [[Andrea Beaumont]] while visiting his parents&#39; grave, and they form a deep mutual attraction. That night, in one of his first crime-fighting attempts, Bruce foils an armored car robbery, but is discouraged because the criminals did not fear him. Bruce decides against avenging his parents, feeling he should do what they wanted had they lived to see him as an adult, and proposes marriage to Andrea, who accepts. However, Andrea mysteriously leaves Gotham with her father, businessman Carl Beaumont, ending her engagement in a [[Dear John letter|\&quot;Dear John\&quot; letter]]. Believing he has lost his last chance of having a normal life, Bruce becomes [[Batman]].\n\nTen years later in the present, Batman confronts a group of [[Gotham City]] [[Organized crime|crime bosses]] led by Chuckie Sol, who are intending to [[money laundering|launder]] millions of [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit dollars]] in a casino. As Sol escapes to his car, a cloaked figure attacks him; Sol is killed when the figure causes him to drive out the side of a parking garage and crash into a neighboring building. Batman is seen immediately afterwards, and is blamed for killing Sol. Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media Batman is a menace (despite [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]&#39;s protests). Attending a party at Wayne Manor, Reeves teases Bruce for allowing Andrea to leave him.\n\nThe cloaked figure murders another gangster, Buzz Bronski, in the same cemetery Bruce met Andrea. Buzz&#39;s bodyguards see the same mysterious figure flee the scene and presume it is Batman. Batman investigates Bronski&#39;s death and wanders to his parents&#39; tombstone. He finds Andrea talking at her mother&#39;s grave, just as she had been when he first met her. She is startled by Batman&#39;s appearance and he flees, causing her to realize who he is. Batman finds evidence linking Carl Beaumont with Sol, Bronski and a third gangster: Salvatore Valestra. He breaks into Valestra&#39;s home and finds a picture of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont seated at a table. When he visits Andrea to try to get more answers she rebuffs him, intimating she now knows his identity. Meanwhile, Valestra, believing Batman killed the others and will come for him, turns to Reeves, who rebuffs him, figuring he is a now an aged, powerless gangster. Valestra then contacts [[Joker (character)|the Joker]] for help.\n\nThe figure arrives at Valestra&#39;s house but finds the gangster dead by Joker&#39;s hands, and through a camera strapped to Valestra&#39;s corpse, Joker sees the murderer is not Batman. The figure escapes as the house explodes. Batman pursues and fights the killer, but is interrupted by the police and rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra&#39;s mob, from whom he had [[embezzlement|embezzled]] money; her father repaid everything, but they put out a [[Contract killing|hit]] for his death anyway. Bruce now believes that her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. Looking at the photo of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont, he sees Valestra&#39;s chauffeur in the background; Bruce realizes the chauffeur is actually the man who would become the Joker. Joker visits Reeves to press him for information about the killer; Reeves insists the killer is Batman, but Joker, believing Reeves is the killer, states Reeves needs to protect his reputation and poisons him. Reeves is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. Reeves confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape, but later betrayed their location to Valestra&#39;s mob after Carl declined to help fund his first election campaign, leading Batman to realize who the killer truly is.\n\nThe cloaked figure tracks Joker to his hideout and, as Joker has also deduced, is revealed to be Andrea, intent on avenging her father&#39;s death by killing every last surviving member of Valestra&#39;s mob: with all the others dead, Joker is the last one alive, and is the one who had carried out the hit on her father. Joker fights her, but before he can kill Andrea, Batman arrives and begs Andrea to give up her quest. She refuses and disappears. After Batman and the Joker battle to a stalemate, with the amusement park about to be blown up, Andrea returns and seizes Joker, bidding Batman goodbye before vanishing with the maniacally laughing clown, and Batman barely escapes the explosions. [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] later consoles Bruce, telling him no one could have helped Andrea. Bruce finds her locket, containing a picture of himself and Andrea, in the [[Batcave]]. Meanwhile, Andrea departs from Gotham on an ocean liner, feeling completely lost. Batman stands on top of a skyscraper when the [[Bat-Signal]] appears in the sky, and swings off into the night to continue his war on crime.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:&lt;br&gt; A billionaire industrialist whose parents were killed by a mugger when he was eight years old. After traveling the world for several years to seek the means to fight injustice, he returns to Gotham. At night, Wayne becomes Batman, Gotham City&#39;s secret vigilante protector.\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Joker (character)|The Joker]]:&lt;br&gt; Once an assassin for Valestra (and responsible for the murder of Carl Beaumont) who later hideously transformed into his more recognizable appearance. Valestra hires him to kill Batman, and is later killed by him. Hamill claims he took the opportunity of reprising his role from &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Animated Series|The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; by way of creating new \&quot;laughing vocabularies\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jacquie Kubin|title=An Interview With Mark Hamill|publisher=Animation World Magazine|date=April 1997|url= http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/kubin2.1.html|accessdate= January 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Dana Delany]] as [[Andrea Beaumont|Andrea Beaumont / The Phantasm]]:&lt;br&gt; A woman Bruce meets in the early years of his return to Gotham after traveling the world. The decision to propose to her in marriage leads to him abandoning his plans for becoming a vigilante. However, after she unexpectedly and mysteriously leaves, Bruce&#39;s anger leads to his becoming Batman. Delany&#39;s voice performance in the film impressed the filmmakers, leading to her casting as [[Lois Lane]] in &#39;&#39;[[Superman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Barry Freiman|title=Exclusive Interview with Dana Delany|publisher=Superman Homepage|date=June 14, 2005|url= http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=interviews/dana-delany|accessdate=January 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stacy Keach (who also voices Carl Beaumont) provided the voice for The Phantasm while masked. \n* [[Hart Bochner]] as Arthur Reeves:&lt;br&gt; A corrupt city official who was once an intern for Carl Beaumont (before \&quot;selling his name to the mob\&quot;). He later becomes involved with Valestra&#39;s gang (even put it to good or at least not-so-good use), and is poisoned by The Joker, but the toxin is incomplete and not fatal due to Joker being interrupted. His last appearance is at the Gotham City Mental Hospital, recovering from the effect of exposure to the Joker&#39;s poisonous chemicals.\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Carl Beaumont:&lt;br&gt; Andrea&#39;s father who made deals with the Valestra gang. He goes in debt to Valestra and flees to Europe with Andrea, but is later murdered. Keach also provided the voice for the Phantasm.\n* [[Abe Vigoda]] as Salvatore \&quot;The Wheezer\&quot; Valestra:&lt;br&gt; A powerful crime boss who practically forces Carl Beaumont to leave. Once Andrea returns, he&#39;s nearly dying with the effects of respiratory difficulties and uses an oxygen tank to stabilize his health. Fearing his death due to the murders of other crime bosses, he hires The Joker to kill Batman. In the end, he himself is killed by The Joker. He dies without learning the full story; that Batman was not responsible for the earlier deaths, which Joker deduces afterwards.\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Charles \&quot;Chuckie\&quot; Sol:&lt;br&gt; A crime boss who falls as the first victim to The Phantasm. Originally a lieutenant to Valestra, he later started his own gang and owned a [[casino]] as a front.\n* [[John P. Ryan]] as Buzz Bronski:&lt;br&gt; A crime boss who seemed to have had a brief partnership with Chuckie Sol whom Buzz always considered a loser. He is later killed by The Phantasm at the graveyard while visiting Sol&#39;s grave.\n* [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]:&lt;br&gt; Once the trusted butler to Bruce Wayne&#39;s parents, he continues his loyal service to their son after their deaths.

The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at [[Arkham Asylum]] and be put on a trial by them, as they wanted to show that he was guilty of making them what they had become. The idea&#39;s concept, however, was considered \&quot;too brainy\&quot;, as it required Batman to be immobile for a long time, so the idea was later used in the series&#39; episode \&quot;Trial\&quot;, which was aired after the movie&#39;s release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/batman-mask-of-the-phantasm-animated-movie-facts-trivia/|title=15 Things You Didn&#39;t Know About Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm|date=February 1, 2017|website=Screenrant.com|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett&#39;s intention to tell a story far removed from the television show&#39;s regular [[rogues gallery]]. Burnett also cited he \&quot;wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show.
