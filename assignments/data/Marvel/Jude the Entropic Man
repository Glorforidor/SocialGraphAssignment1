In most versions, it is depicted as a network of [[terrorist]] [[arms dealer]]s and [[scientist]]s specializing in highly advanced and technological weaponry, whose ultimate goal is the overthrow of all world governments for their own gains. The organization originated as a branch of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], created by [[Baron Strucker]]. Its most notable creations include the [[Cosmic Cube]], [[Super-Adaptoid]], and [[MODOK]]; the latter has been depicted as a prominent member of A.I.M., and in some incarnations is the organization&#39;s leader.\n\nA.I.M. has been featured in several media adaptations, including television series and video games. The organization made its cinematic debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film &#39;&#39;[[Iron Man 3]]&#39;&#39; (2013).\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}\nThe organization known as A.I.M. first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Strange Tales]]&#39;&#39; #146 (July 1966), and was revealed to be a branch of the organization known as THEM in &#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #147 (August 1966), a larger organization mentioned in &#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #142 (March 1966), and depicted in &#39;&#39;Tales of Suspense&#39;&#39; #78 (June 1966) a few months earlier. It was later revealed that THEM was also a parent organization to the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] and that it was, in fact, a new incarnation of the previously dissolved organization [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] in &#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #149 (October 1966).\n\n==Organization==\nA.I.M. is an organization of brilliant scientists and their hirelings dedicated to the acquisition of power and the overthrow of all world governments by technological means. Its leadership traditionally consisted of the seven-member [[Board of directors|Board of Directors]] (formerly known as the Imperial Council) with a rotating chairperson. Under the Directors are various division supervisors, and under them are the technicians and salesmen/dealers.\n\nThe organization supplies arms and technology to various terrorist and subversive organizations both to foster a violent technological revolution and to make a profit. A.I.M. operatives are usually involved in research, development, manufacturing, and sales of high technology. Members of A.I.M. are required to at least have a master&#39;s degree, if not a Ph.D, in some area of science, mathematics, or business.\n\nA.I.M.&#39;s reach is worldwide, including various front organizations such as Targo Corporation, International Data Integration and Control, and Cadenza Industries. A.I.M. has also operated under some other fronts including Koenig and Strey, Pacific Vista Laboratories, Allen&#39;s Department Store, and Omnitech.\n\nA.I.M. has had a number of bases of operations, including a nuclear submarine mobile in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; a base in [[the Bronx, New York]]; Black Mesa, Colorado; [[West Caldwell, New Jersey]]; [[Asia]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Haiti]], [[India]], [[Sudan]] and Boca Caliente (also known as A.I.M. Island), an island republic in the [[Caribbean]].\n\n==Technology==\nA.I.M. has created three major implements of deadly potential which stand far above the rest of their accomplishments. The greatest of these was the [[Cosmic Cube]], a device capable of altering reality.&lt;ref name=Doucet&gt;John P. Doucet, \&quot;Chapter One: On the Design of Mental Organisms\&quot;, in: Marie Hendry and Jennifer Page, eds., &#39;&#39;Media, Technology and the Imagination&#39;&#39;, Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-4438-4850-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ztMwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.&amp;nbsp;19\u201320].&lt;/ref&gt; A.I.M. did not realize that the cube was merely a containment device, in which the real power was an entity accidentally drawn into this dimension. The Cosmic Cube eventually evolved into [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]]. Their second achievement was the [[Super-Adaptoid]], an android capable of mimicking the appearance and superpowers of other beings. The Super-Adaptoid&#39;s powers were made possible by incorporating a sliver of the Cosmic Cube into its form. When Kubik repossessed the sliver after defeating the Adaptoid, the android was rendered inanimate. A.I.M.&#39;s third and final major achievement was the creation of [[MODOK]] (&#39;&#39;&#39;M&#39;&#39;&#39;ental &#39;&#39;&#39;O&#39;&#39;&#39;rganism &#39;&#39;&#39;D&#39;&#39;&#39;esigned &#39;&#39;&#39;O&#39;&#39;&#39;nly for &#39;&#39;&#39;K&#39;&#39;&#39;illing), an artificially mutated human with an enormous head and corresponding massive computational brain, and psionic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Tales of Suspense&#39;&#39; #93\u201394&lt;/ref&gt; MODOK was originally an ordinary A.I.M. scientist, George Tarleton, who was selected by A.I.M.&#39;s leader at the time, the [[Scientist Supreme]], to be the subject of the bionic and genetic experiments that turned him into MODOK.&lt;ref name=Doucet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;origin revealed in &#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; #133&lt;/ref&gt; After his transformation, MODOK killed the Scientist Supreme and took control of A.I.M., and later took advantage of the organizational chaos following the destruction of HYDRA Island and the deaths of Baron Strucker and most of HYDRA&#39;s leading members to sever all of A.I.M.&#39;s ties with HYDRA. A.I.M. has remained an independent organization ever since.\n\nA.I.M.&#39;s level of technology is as highly advanced as any on Earth, and its scientists have also built various cyborgs, robots, and androids; its agents utilize a variety of submarines, hovercraft, jets, etc. A.I.M. has also attempted to recreate versions of MODOK, including transforming [[Kate Waynesboro|Dr. Katherine Waynesboro]] into Ms. MODOK&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Hulk&#39;&#39; #190&lt;/ref&gt; and creating SODAM&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Solo Avengers&#39;&#39; #14\u201316&lt;/ref&gt; (later revamped as MODAM).&lt;ref name=\&quot;Quasar #8\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Quasar&#39;&#39; #8&lt;/ref&gt; Since A.I.M&#39;s redirection as an exotic arms dealer,&lt;ref name=\&quot;Quasar #8\&quot;/&gt; its members have access to whatever exotic weaponry is available in its warehouses.\n\nA.I.M.&#39;s leaders traditionally wear yellow three-piece business suits. Technical supervisors wear yellow jumpsuits, skull-caps, and goggles. However, the organization is renowned for the &#39;[[beekeeper]]&#39;-looking helmets and [[NBC suit]] uniform of its underlings since the first appearance.\n\nHowever, as a result of the [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|\&quot;Scorpion: Poison Tomorrow\&quot;]] arc of &#39;&#39;[[Amazing Fantasy]]&#39;&#39;, A.I.M. has gained a new costume, which tends towards [[insectoid]] armor and large guns.\n\nThe [[Livewires (comics)|Livewires]] member named Cornfed wears an A.I.M. uniform. He also wears a button referencing \&quot;The Real A.I.M\&quot;.\n\n==Fictional organization history==\nA.I.M.&#39;s origins began late in World War II with [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]]&#39;s creation of his subversive organization [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]]. Under the code name of THEM, he created two HYDRA branches called Advanced Idea Mechanics and the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]. A.I.M.&#39;s purpose was to develop advanced weaponry for HYDRA. They were close to developing and attaining nuclear weapons when HYDRA Island was invaded by American and Japanese troops. Although HYDRA suffered a major setback, it survived and grew in secret over the following decades.\n\nA.I.M. has had numerous encounters with various superheroes and supervillains, and is the subject of ongoing undercover investigations by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. It was responsible for reviving the [[Red Skull]] from [[suspended animation]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Tales of Suspense&#39;&#39; #79. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; An A.I.M. android factory in a Florida swamp was once raided by S.H.I.E.L.D., which also involved Count Bornag Royale in a weapons deal negotiation with S.H.I.E.L.D..&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #146. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; A.I.M. then raided S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s New York City headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #147. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these events, Royale was discredited, and A.I.M.&#39;s headquarters was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #149. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA.I.M. employed [[Batroc the Leaper]] to recover an explosive compound called Inferno 42&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Tales of Suspense&#39;&#39; #75\u201376. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; and dispatched a chemical android against [[Nick Fury]] and [[Captain America]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Tales of Suspense&#39;&#39; #78&lt;/ref&gt; A.I.M. also dispatched their special agent, the Cyborg, against Captain America.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Captain America #124\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; #124. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; A.I.M. was involved in a skirmish with the [[Maggia (comics)#The Nefaria Family|Maggia]] and its \&quot;Big M\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man and Sub-Mariner&#39;&#39; #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; A.I.M. has also captured [[Iron Man]] in an attempt to analyze and replicate his [[Iron Man&#39;s armor|armor]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Iron Man #1\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man&#39;&#39; #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; MODOK and A.I.M. were responsible for transforming [[Betty Ross]] briefly into the gamma-irradiated bird-woman called the Harpy.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Hulk&#39;&#39; #167\u2013168&lt;/ref&gt; A.I.M. dispatched their special agent the [[Doomsday Man|Destructor]] to capture [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Ms. Marvel #2\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Ms. Marvel&#39;&#39; #1-4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFor a time, a schism developed within A.I.M., causing it to split into Blue and Yellow factions (the former loyal to MODOK, the latter independent from him). These factions battled each other,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ms. Marvel&#39;&#39; #7. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; with MODOK and the Blue faction once employing [[Deathbird]] as an operative.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ms. Marvel&#39;&#39; #9\u201310. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; A.I.M. captured the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Namor]] to test Virus X on them.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Two-In-One&#39;&#39; #81\u201382. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue faction later made an attempt to recapture the [[Cosmic Cube]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Captain America Annual #7\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America Annual&#39;&#39; #7. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; A second battle occurred between the rival factions,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Hulk&#39;&#39; #289. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; but factions no longer seem to be active within A.I.M. since then.\n\nA.I.M. eventually hired the [[Serpent Society]] to kill MODOK, which they did.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; #313&lt;/ref&gt; A.I.M. was responsible for a jet attack on the [[West Coast Avengers]] compound&lt;ref name=\&quot;Iron Man #201\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man&#39;&#39; #201. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; and then took over Boca Caliente&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man&#39;&#39; #207\u2013208&lt;/ref&gt; and unleashed a microbe aboard the Stark space satellite.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man&#39;&#39; #215. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; A.I.M. also sent an agent to attempt to confiscate the quantum-bands given to [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Quasar&#39;&#39; #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe organization was revealed to have become a &#39;techno-anarchist&#39; group, with no connection to HYDRA, and even a hatred for fascism. With the introduction of the [[Death&#39;s Head#Death&#39;s Head 3.0|Death&#39;s Head 3.0]] character, a pacifist future version of the organization is promised, with a surprise character as leader.&lt;ref&gt;the [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|&#39;&#39;Scorpion: Poison Tomorrow&#39;&#39;]] arc of [[Amazing Fantasy]]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIt is later revealed that A.I.M. helped General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] and [[Doc Samson]] create the [[Red Hulk]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Incredible Hulk&#39;&#39; #600. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA.I.M. was revealed to be behind the pocket dimension of Earth-13584 by using a sliver of time they obtained to alter certain events so they can obtain the technology and science from various individuals. They did this by exploiting the fluid nature of time brought on by the manipulations of Kang the Conqueror traveling back to alter the past. This lasted until the [[Dark Avengers]] ended up in this reality causing it to collapse. The Dark Avengers were able to get out before the pocket dimension collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Dark Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #190. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter the [[Secret Avengers]] recruited [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] after freeing him from Bagalia, they send him to infiltrate the new High Council of A.I.M. which consists of Andrew Forson, [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], Jude the Entropic Man, [[Mentallo]], [[Superia]], and [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Secret Avengers #2\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Forson then leads A.I.M. into attending a weapons expo which led to A.I.M. fighting against the Secret Avengers. During the battle, Andrew Forson takes the opportunity to steal the [[Iron Patriot]] armor.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDaisy Johnson launched an unsanctioned operation to send the Secret Avengers to A.I.M. Island to assassinate Forson, and they seemingly killed him. Johnson ended up suspended for breaking protocol and Maria Hill is put in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. again. As Forson was revealed to be alive all along, the news of A.I.M. being a new permanent member of the Security Council is known.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #5. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nUsing an as-yet-unidentified device in the pages of &#39;&#39;[[Avengers World]]&#39;&#39;, Andrew Forson and A.I.M. accelerate the flow of time within the limits of A.I.M. Island, creating in a matter of hours for the real world year of progress and transforming A.I.M. into a technologically advanced empire.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers World&#39;&#39; #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA.I.M. has a more violent offshoot, Advanced Ideas of Destruction (A.I.D.); the two competing organizations were major antagonists of [[Captain America]] in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name=Steinmetz&gt;Christian Steinmetz,&lt;!-- not [[Christian Steinmetz]], the basketballer --&gt; \&quot;A Genealogy of Evil: Captain America vs. the Shadows of the National Imagined Community\&quot;, in: Robert G.

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===2020 Death&#39;s Head Future===\nA future (2020) version of A.I.M was featured heavily in the [[Marvel UK]] limited series &#39;&#39;[[Death&#39;s Head (Minion)|Death&#39;s Head II]]&#39;&#39;. This future organisation created the cyborg Minion, which was later taken over by the personality of Death&#39;s Head. A.I.M&#39;s representative [[Evelyn Necker]] became a popular character in the ongoing series that followed.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;Amazing Fantasy&#39;&#39; ##16\u201320, set further in the same future, A.I.M is on the point of making peace with the UN, when a renegade A.I.M. scientist unleashes Death&#39;s Head 3.0 on the peace conference.\n\n===House of M===\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[House of M]]&#39;&#39; reality, A.I.M. is re-imagined as a human [[resistance movement]] led by Monica Rappacini to oppose [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], ruler of [[Australia]] and his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|cohorts]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Incredible Hulk&#39;&#39; #83. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Marvel Adventures===\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Adventures]]&#39;&#39; version of Iron Man, A.I.M., through the use of dummy companies, acquired Stark International&#39;s hover platform and uni-beam technology in their invasion of Madripoor, a third world country. [[Gia-Bao Yinsen]] tried to tell the world about A.I.M.&#39;s terrorist attacks on his country. However, his message is dismissed. During Tony Stark&#39;s test of his new solar-powered glider, A.I.M. causes Tony to crash on their artificial island. Tony&#39;s heart is damaged, and A.I.M. forces him to build an EMP weapon to allow A.I.M.&#39;s forces to finish their conquest of Madripoor. In exchange, A.I.M. will repair his heart. Tony learns that Yinsen was also kidnapped, as A.I.M. wanted to prevent him from telling the world about their attacks on his country and to use his intellect to build technology for A.I.M.. Similar to Iron Man&#39;s main [[Marvel Universe]] origin, Yinsen and Tony both build armor to escape. However, Yinsen destroys the generator powering the island in order to save his homeland. The explosion kills Yinsen, but Tony Stark lives. Tony becomes Iron Man to prevent people like A.I.M. from committing evil against innocents. Here, the Supreme Scientist is a black-haired woman who is extremely brilliant. In addition, the uniforms that A.I.M. uses are basically NBC orange suits. However, the Supreme Scientist wears black clothing in a style similar to Darth Vader.\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] reality, A.I.M. commissioned [[Rhona Burchill|Mad Thinker]] to steal [[Cerebro]] from the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] and frame the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]], as seen in the &#39;&#39;[[Ultimate X4]]&#39;&#39; mini-series.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate X4&#39;&#39;. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimate A.I.M.&#39;s full purpose and function has yet to be revealed. The miniseries &#39;&#39;Ultimate [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]&#39;&#39; introduces A.I.M. as composed of several directorates spread across the globe, with [[MODOK|George Tarleton]] as an A.I.M. leader on an orbital research facility. Tarleton and his team attempted to take control of a [[Galactus#Ultimate Marvel|Gah Lak Tus]] module that was left behind in orbit after the swarm was driven away. Being unable to do so on their own, they lured Vision to the station to help them by claiming they would use the knowledge to order the Gah Lak Tus swarm to self-destruct. Once the cyborg Tarleton had connected to the module using Vision, he had the module fire an energy beam at her. Tarleton then incorporated the Gah Lak Tus&#39; circuitry into his own body, but it has seemingly taken him over, transforming him more into a machine, with a monstrous appearance. He has since taken over the entire station remotely and has set it to plummet out of orbit, along with the Gah Lak Tus module, which he says has \&quot;unfinished business on Earth.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Vision&#39;&#39; #3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Tarleton was broken free of the module&#39;s control and helped the Vision and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon a.k.a. Dr. Samuel Wilson]] in destroying the module.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Vision&#39;&#39; #5.
