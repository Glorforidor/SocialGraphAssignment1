This cartoon, which ran from 1988 to 1989, focuses on a team of highly trained policemen tasked with protecting the fictional Empire City from a group of gangsters led by the \&quot;Big Boss.\&quot; The tag lines for the series are \u201cFighting crime in a future time\u201d and \&quot;It&#39;s crime fightin&#39; time!\&quot; In 1993, the series was shown in reruns on CBS Saturday mornings under the new name CyberCOPS, due to the 1989 debut of the unrelated primetime reality show of the same name. The show was based on Hasbro\u2019s 1988 line of action figures called C.O.P.S. \u2019n\u2019 Crooks.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn the year 2020, Brandon \u201cBig Boss\u201d Babel and his gang of crooks are causing crime to run rampant in Empire City enough for the Empire City Police Department to be unable to stop him.Mayor Davis requests federal assistance. The FBI sends in Special Agent Baldwin P. Vess (Codename: Bulletproof) to help take down Big Boss. However, Vess suffered very serious injuries in a car wreck during a fight with Big Boss\u2019 criminal henchmen and had to be taken to the hospital. Facing years of rehabilitation, Vess is outfitted with a cybernetic bulletproof torso that allows him to walk again.\nWhile staying at the hospital, Bulletproof, knowing he cannot do all of this alone, sends out Empire City police officer P.J. O\u2019Malley (Codename: LongArm) and rookie officer Donny Brooks (Codename: HardTop) to round up the best law enforcers from all over the country. With these men and women consisting of David E. \u201cHighway\u201d Harlson, Colt \u201cMace\u201d Howards, Stan \u201cBarricade\u201d Hyde, Tina \u201cMainframe\u201d Cassidy, Walker \u201cSundown\u201d Calhoun, Suzie \u201cMirage\u201d Young, Hugh S. \u201cBullseye\u201d Forward, and Rex \u201cBowser\u201d Pointer and his robot dog Blitz, he forms a team that is \u201cthe finest law enforcement agency there is in the country.\u201d Bulletproof becomes the proud founder and commander of COPS. Together, he and his COPS team are able to take down Big Boss and his gang of crooks and thwart the first of many of Big Boss\u2019 criminal schemes.Each episode has a title that begins with \u201cThe Case of...\u201d with a different phrase being added to it (e.g. \u201cThe Case of the Iron C.O.P.S. and Wooden CROOKS\u201d; \u201cThe Case of the Half-Pint Hero\u201d; and \u201cThe Case of the Crime Nobody Heard\u201d) along with the COPS file number. Bulletproof would narrate at the beginning of the episode as well as at the end, concluding by repeating the COPS file number and title, ending it with \u201cCase Closed\u201d with a \u201cClosed\u201d mark being stamped onto the file folder. The two exceptions are the first parts of each of the two-part episodes, \u201cThe Case of Big Boss\u2019 Master Plan\u201d and \u201cThe Case of C.O.P.S. File #1,\u201d where the conclusion of the episode is marked with a \u201cCase Continued\u201d plastered on the files.\nIn the cartoon, the COPS frequently shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s crime fighting time!\u201d as a battle cry when it was time to bag the CROOKS and solve a caper. Meanwhile, the CROOKS would shout \u201cCrime\u2019s a-wasting!\u201d whenever they went to do another caper, whether it was pulling another heist (as in so many episodes such as \u201cThe Case of the Blur Bandits\u201d), giving C.O.P.S. a hard time to the point of replacing (actually disposing) them for good (as in \u201cThe Case of the Big Boss\u2019 Master Plan\u201d) or taking captive a certain individual to be held prisoner for ransom (as in \u201cThe Case of the Ransomed Rascal\u201d).\nThe music for the series was created by Shuki Levy, while the COPS theme music was written and composed by Haim Saban.\nNumerous characters were featured in the cartoon that did not have action figures (including Mainframe, Brian O\u2019Malley, Whitney Morgan, Nightshade, Ms. Demeanor, and Mirage).\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n=== COPS ===\nCOPS is short for Central Organization of Police Specialists.

He joined up with Big Boss\u2019 gang, but left when he did not get a high pay. This causes Nightshade and Buttons McBoomBoom to steal Bugman&#39;s bugs and the insect-controlling device and use them in their crimes. When Mainframe and Bowser and Blitz found him after tailing Gaylord, they find out that Bugman only turned to crime because people stopped coming to see his Flea Circus meaning that he was simply desperate. They help him into regaining his insect-controlling device. Though Buttons and Nightshade are defeated, Bugman is also arrested for trying to steal jewels that the pair stole using Bugman&#39;s bugs. He was last seen restarting his flea circus in prison where his entertaining of the guards is a diversion for Gaylord who secretly makes for the keys. In \u201cThe Case of the Lesser of Two Weevils,\u201d Bugman escapes from prison when Gaylord gets captured by his rival the Boll Weevil.

When COPS storms Vetrocon, Vargas unleashes the Instant Justice Machines on them. When Mace and Barricade catch up to Vargas, he threatens to blow up the factory. He then demands immunity and an offer to name names of anyone involved. Barricade is able to convince Vargas that suicide would be a waste. Vargas then realises he doesn&#39;t want to kill himself and the people in the factory, so he gives himself up and is sentenced to prison.\nInstant Justice Machines \u2014 A bunch of robots built by Vargas in order to put COPS out of business. They act not only as police officers, but also as judges and jailers leaving the culprit trapped until a police car comes by. Some of the crimes they busted involved a man illegally parking on a spot that is only allowed on Tuesdays, a woman jaywalking, a man littering when his hat fell off in the wind while carrying groceries, and two teens speeding on their skateboards. When it came to Highway busting Ms. Demeanor, an Instant Justice Machine found her innocent of all charges. The Instant Justice Machines ended up fighting COPS when they stormed Vetrocon. Barricade even talked the Instant Justice Machine guarding him and Mac into releasing them. When Mace and Barricade end up cornering Vargas, the other Instant Justice Machines stopped their attacks. Following Vargas\u2019 arrest, most of the Instant Justice Machines were deactivated except for the one that Barricade talked into freeing him and Mace. The Instant Justice Machine in COPS\u2019 possession reappeared in \u201cThe Case of the Big Boss\u2019 Master Plan\u201d two-part episode.\nJohnny Yuma \u2014 Johnny Yuma is the former partner of Sundown who became an outlaw.

Sundown hears of Johnny&#39;s prison break and manages to confront him when he breaks into the cowboy museum to regain his lasso, from the Outlaws Hall of Fame. Johnny manages to lasso Sundown to a robotic bull. As Johnny heads out to rob the Silver Bullet Express, Turbo Tu-Tone trails him and turns on the robotic bull to stall Sundown. Upon being tipped off by Turbo Tu-Tone, Big Boss sends Berserko, Rock Krusher, and Buttons McBoomBoom to recruit Johnny Yuma. When the three rendezvous with Turbo Tu-Tone to recruit Johnny Yuma into Big Boss\u2019 gang, Johnny Yuma tells them that he works alone and defeats them. Johnny then leaves to go rob the Silver Bullet Express prompting Berserko to lead the Turbo Tu-Tone, Rock Krusher, and Buttons McBoomBoom into robbing it first. Sundown manages to catch up to Johnny Yuma on the Silver Bullet Express and ends up fighting him until Big Boss\u2019 minions crash the fight. After Berserko, Turbo Tu-Tone, Rock Krusher, and Buttons McBoomBoom were defeated, Johnny Yuma agrees to return to jail to finish his sentence which led to an early release due to good behavior. He now works as a deputy in a small Texas town.\nSmall Guy \u2014 A pint-sized criminal who ran his own gang.\nJenny Wringer \u2014 A female con artist.\nBig Momma \u2014 An old lady who is Big Boss&#39;s mother and Berserko&#39;s grandmother.

When she once visited Empire City to visit her son, Big Boss had to cover up his criminal side by stating that he is a philanthropist and even started an orphanage with his henchmen posing as orphans.

These included staying away from drugs, gangs, how to be safe at home and on the street, and how to help in preventing crime. Each and every C.O.P.S. for Kids segment was made with the blessing and assistance of organizations like DARE, the National Crime Prevention Council and the California Highway Patrol. These segments were omitted from some international broadcasts of the show.\n\n\n== Broadcast ==\nC.O.P.S. was released into syndication in 1988. The program was re-titled Cyber C.O.P.S. and re-run on CBS from March 27 to September 4, 1993. It was re-run again on the USA Network from January 2 to March 9, 1995 under its original title.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHal Erickson, author of Television Cartoon Shows, An Illustrated Encyclopedia stated that \u201cC.O.P.S. had potential--though it was a potential left unrealized by the dishearteningly flat animation style.\u201d Erickson noted that C.O.P.S. \u201cscored with a sturdy inner lining of social satire\u201d such as Mayor Davis\u2019 cost-cutting attempts that would unwittingly aid the cause of the villain. IGN gave the show a rating of three out of ten, stating that \u201cto fully appreciate this series one must have a tolerance for clunky, mechanical animation (the kind that says \u201cWe really didn\u2019t spend too much money on it\u201d) and a love for \u201980s-style action\u201d; and that \u201cit offers little in terms of character development. I mean, all any kid needs to know is the C.O.P.S are the good guys and Big Boss and crew are the bad guys. Beyond that, the cartoon does offer one element to behold: its emphasis on gadgetry.\u201d\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== References ===\nErickson, Hal (2005). Television Cartoon Shows. 1 (2nd ed.).
