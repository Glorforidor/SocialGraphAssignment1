As such she has many of her father&#39;s powers relating to magic, typically controlled by speaking the words of her incantations spelled backwards.\n\nShe is known for her involvement with the [[Justice League]], her [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] childhood association with [[Batman]], and her crossing of the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] line with characters such as romantic partner [[John Constantine]].\n\nZatanna made her first live-action appearance as a recurring character in the final three seasons of &#39;&#39;[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]&#39;&#39;, portrayed by actress [[Serinda Swan]].\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Murphy Anderson]], Zatanna first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Hawkman (comic book)|Hawkman]]&#39;&#39; #4 (November 1964).

Her younger cousin, the teenager [[Zachary Zatara]], is also a magician in the DCU. Zatanna makes her living as a stage [[illusionist]] prior to discovering her magical abilities while investigating the disappearance of her father. Her original costume is based upon her father&#39;s costume but substituting [[fishnet]] [[Hosiery|stockings]] and [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]] for slacks.

After a brief stay, she sent Molly home and Tim wandered off on his own adventures. In 1993, Zatanna starred in her first solo limited series, titled &#39;&#39;Zatanna: Come Together&#39;&#39;, which saw her summoning her mother&#39;s spirit and battling the sorcerer Tannarak and a demon called Xaos.\n\nWhen the Justice League vanish in the past as they attempt to rescue the missing Aquaman, an emergency protocol set up by Batman assembles a new League, with this team including [[Jason Blood]] as its magical expert. However, when the current threat is identified as [[Gamemnae]], an ancient Atlantean sorceress who seeks to conquer the world, she uses a quagmire spell to absorb Zatanna and Tempest into herself. When new League leader Nightwing attempts to order Blood to transform into Etrigan to help them against Gamemnae, Blood insists that Zatanna is the one they need, sacrificing himself to Gamemnae&#39;s quagmire spell in order to free Zatanna. She subsequently joins Nightwing, Firestorm and Hawkgirl in travelling back to ancient Atlantis, where Aquaman has been trapped in a pool of water as a water wraith, Firestorm creating a channel between the pool and the sea before Zatanna casts a spell that allowed the water-based Aquaman to control the entire ocean as his body, allowing him to sink Atlantis in the past and present and disrupt Gamemnae&#39;s power.\n\nZatanna starred in another solo one-shot in 2003, &#39;&#39;Zatanna: Everyday Magic&#39;&#39;, in which she fought Nimue Ravensong, a magic-user jealous of Zatanna&#39;s ability to use magic naturally and without committing sacrifices. Nimue seduced and cursed John Constantine, leading Zatanna into conflict with the wannabe sorceress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Paul Dini|Dini, Paul]]|penciller= Mays, Rick|inker= Mays, Rick|story= Everyday Magic|title= Zatanna|issue= #1|date=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2004 limited series &#39;&#39;[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]&#39;&#39;, Zatanna is a member of the Justice League at the time the villain [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] rapes the Elongated Man&#39;s wife, [[Sue Dibny]]. When apprehended, he threatens the JLA members&#39; families. Although Zatanna is prepared to erase Light&#39;s memories of the incident as she had done to other villains with knowledge dangerous to the League, tampering with Light&#39;s mind sparks a debate among the team&#39;s members: should the villain&#39;s personality be transformed to prevent him from repeating his crime? Zatanna, Hawkman, and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)]] vote for such action, while [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]], and Green Lantern vote against. The [[Flash (Barry Allen)]] breaks the tie. Zatanna [[mind-wipe]]s Light, and the process results in his intellectual abilities being lowered.&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill, Alan \&quot;2000s\&quot; in Dolan, p. 313: \&quot;The Justice League had...asked Zatanna to erase Light&#39;s memory and alter his mind.\&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of the process, Batman appears and tries to stop it. Zatanna freezes him, and the members vote unanimously to erase Batman&#39;s memories of the incident as well.\n\nHer working relationship to Batman sours after he discovers the alteration to his memory. When Zatanna helps Batman with reconnaissance at one of [[Ra&#39;s al Ghul]]&#39;s [[Lazarus Pit]]s, she asks him why he came to her. \&quot;I needed someone I could trust,\&quot; Batman says. \&quot;But I had to settle for you.\&quot; After &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39;, their relationship appears to have warmed; in &#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; #824 he calls her for information on a card-counter involved in scamming the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]. He makes no mention of their conflict, and casually calls her by her nickname, \&quot;Zee\&quot;.\n\n[[Catwoman]] discovers that Zatanna&#39;s mind-wipe of Dr. Light in &#39;&#39;Identity Crisis&#39;&#39; is not an isolated occurrence; Catwoman&#39;s journey from villain to hero and her resulting efforts to lead a moral life are retconned as being the result of Zatanna&#39;s mental intervention. Catwoman comes to distrust her memories, motives, and the choices she has made since that incident. In retaliation, Catwoman covers Zatanna&#39;s mouth with a piece of duct tape, gagging her, and shoves her out a window.\n\nA 2005 four-issue &#39;&#39;Zatanna&#39;&#39; limited series was published as part of [[Grant Morrison]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Seven Soldiers]]&#39;&#39; event.&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill \&quot;2000s\&quot; in Dolan, p. 319: \&quot;Grant Morrison&#39;s imagining of the &#39;&#39;Seven Soldiers of Victory&#39;&#39; was one of DC&#39;s most adventurous titles...The story started in &#39;&#39;Seven Soldiers of Victory&#39;&#39; #0 and continued in seven four-issue miniseries \u2013 &#39;&#39;The Bulleteer&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Frankenstein&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Mister Miracle&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Zatanna&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Shining Knight&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Manhattan Guardian&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;Klarion&#39;&#39;.\&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In it, at a [[support group]] for superheroes, she recounts a failed magical ritual to search for her father&#39;s tomes, during which one of her past spells summons a [[Shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] named Gwydion, who kills her companions. This [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], combined with her guilt from her former mind-wipes, robs her of her powers. With the help of her new apprentice, [[Sheeda#Sheeda characters|Misty Kilgore]], she captures Gwydion to use as her own. She eventually regains her confidence and powers, and uses them to defeat Zor, a rogue Time Tailor who released the Sheeda as a [[wiktionary:plague|plague]] to infect and degrade the entire universe. As a reward, the other Time Tailors allow her one last meeting with her father, who reveals that his books were written for her, his \&quot;greatest spell and gift to the world.\&quot; In the final battle against the Sheeda, Zatanna casts a spell to move time and space, retroactively positioning the Seven Soldiers to overthrow the Sheeda.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; #833 (August 2007), it is stated that Zatanna&#39;s father was a friend of [[Thomas Wayne]]. Zatara trained Bruce Wayne in the art of escape, and Bruce and Zatanna were childhood friends, although Batman believes that he has never met her in &#39;&#39;Justice League of America&#39;&#39; #51, and her only memory of meeting him is while she was disguised. Bruce helps Zatanna investigate the death of one of her former assistants; all clues point to a performer named Ivar Loxias. Loxias is revealed to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] in disguise; he shoots Zatanna in the throat and incapacitates Batman. Zatanna is able to heal herself by writing a curing spell in her own blood, and she is instrumental in foiling the Joker&#39;s scheme. Bruce puts Zatanna&#39;s betrayal behind him, allowing the two to renew their friendship.\n\nOn the \&quot;Roll Call\&quot; of &#39;&#39;Justice League of America&#39;&#39; #22 (August 2008), Zatanna is listed as a part of the team. Called upon to help with the [[Red Tornado]]&#39;s restoration in his android form, she aids the League when they are attacked by a new, powerful iteration of [[Amazo]]. During the battle, Zatanna has her mouth magically removed with her spells, and once again uses her blood to write out spells and restore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Dwayne McDuffie|McDuffie, Dwayne]]|penciller= [[Ed Benes|Benes, Ed]]|inker= Benes, Ed|story= The Second Coming Chapter Two: Things Fall Apart|title= Justice League of America|volume= 2|issue= #23|date= September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is silenced again after Amazo uses his [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] to create a gag for her mouth that she is unable to remove, rendering her useless for much of the fight.

Art by Sami Basri.]]\nZatanna is one of the most powerful sorceresses in the DC universe, whose abilities are apparently [[gene]]tic. As a tribute to her father and as a focal point, she usually casts spells by speaking verbal commands backwards. She has proven capable on many occasions of casting spells by speaking normally, and, in rarer occasions, the ability to use magic for simple tasks without speaking. Like the [[Black Canary]], Zatanna&#39;s reliance on her voice often leads to her being bound and gagged by villains, a measure that renders her &#39;powerless&#39;. On very rare occasions, Zatanna has cast spells by writing them in her own blood rather than speaking them aloud. It is used as a last resort, only to heal from severe physical damage preventing her from speaking, like having her [[larynx]] mangled by a bullet, or her mouth magically erased by her own powers. The only magic command issued in both cases, &#39;&#39;Heal me&#39;&#39;, had to be spelled backwards, as if she were speaking (&#39;&#39;laeH em&#39;&#39;).\n\nHer magical powers increase if not used,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Matthew Sturges|Sturges, Matthew]]|artist=[[St\u00e9phane Roux (comics)|Roux, St\u00e9phane]]|letterer=Brosseau, Pat|editor=[[Joey Cavalieri]], Chris Conroy|story=SymmetryyrtemmyS|title=[[Zatanna (comic book)|Zatanna]]|volume=2|issue=#12|date=June 2011|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location= |page= |panel= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but overuse can deplete them to the point that further use strains her physical well-being; as with other magical users, the only way to restore her waning powers is an extended period of rest.\n\nWhile not as adept as [[Madame Xanadu]], Zatanna has proven herself able to call upon [[tarot]] reading for insight or divination.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Detective847\&quot; /&gt; Apparently, such a task does not require verbal incantations, spoken or written, at all, nor is it tied to a specific tarot deck.\n\nThe limits of her powers have never been clearly established. She is often depicted working alongside the most powerful magic-users on Earth, including [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], [[Madame Xanadu]], [[John Constantine]], the [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], and [[Doctor Fate]], while on another occasion Jason Blood sacrificed himself to free Zatanna from a trap, as he felt that she was better qualified to face the current threat than he was.

During a portion of her initial tenure with the Justice League, her powers were more limited, consisting in the manipulation of [[Classical element|fire, air, water, and earth.]] Furthermore, her powers seems tied to her self-confidence, as the long series of blunders described in &#39;&#39;Seven Soldiers&#39;&#39; left her both emotionally and psychologically shattered, powerless, until she was able to restore her lost confidence.\n\nZatanna is a skilled illusionist, showgirl and stage magician even without resorting to her innate magical powers. She considers part of her \&quot;training\&quot; exercising [[sleight of hand]] tricks, and she claims to have invented a variation of the [[three-card monte]] called the \&quot;Zatara shuffle\&quot;, in which she is so fast and precise that, even without resorting to cheating, only skilled gamblers like Selina Kyle are able to follow the movements of her hands.\n\nZatanna is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by her father during her childhood.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===&#39;&#39;DC Super Dictionary&#39;&#39;===\nThe 1978 &#39;&#39;DC Super Dictionary&#39;&#39; invented a character, Conjura, who had the same magic ability as Zatanna, in addition to possessing a time-traveling amulet.

Looking for her father&#39;s &#39;&#39;Book of Magick&#39;&#39; in England, she meets John Constantine for the first time. They team up to rescue [[Raven (DC Comics)|Rachel Roth]] and retrieve the &#39;&#39;Book of Magick&#39;&#39; from [[Brother Blood]]. Similar to the TV show, her spells are spoken entirely backwards.\n\n===&#39;&#39;DC Bombshells&#39;&#39;===\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[DC Bombshells]]&#39;&#39; continuity, Zatanna was the daughter of a Jewish father and a Romani mother during World War II, but was prevented from being sent to the concentration camps thanks to the Joker&#39;s Daughter, who in return, forced her to perform magic to aid the Third Reich. Her lover, John Constantine, confronted her during one of her shows in an attempt to rescue her, but knowing they were surrounded, Zatanna transformed John into a rabbit and kept him under her care to prevent his death. He eventually convinces her to use her magic to aid the Allies, which she does by transforming her soul into a large, spiritual dove that aids Batwoman in freeing a refugee camp. Their attempts are discovered by the Nazis, and the two are depowered of their magic (with John being turned back into a human) and sent into the ghettos. Zatanna slowly gains her powers back over time, and finds a kindred spirit in another magic user imprisoned by the Joker&#39;s Daughter, Raven. They eventually defeat and depower the Joker&#39;s Daughter after allying herself with the Bombshells.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Animation====\n*Zatanna has made multiple appearances in the [[DC Animated Universe]]:\n[[File:Zatanna (Justice League Unlimited).png|96px|thumb|Zatanna as seen on &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39;.]]\n** Zatanna first appears in a &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; episode, voiced by [[Julie Brown]]. She is an illusionist with no apparent magic powers. She developed a close relationship with Bruce Wayne (using the alias John Smith) during the years in which Bruce was traveling the globe learning skills from Zatanna&#39;s father that later serves well as Batman; in particular, escape artistry. In the episode [[Zatanna (Batman: The Animated Series)|\&quot;Zatanna\&quot;]], she visits [[Gotham City]] with her magic show, but finds herself being framed by criminal magic debunker Montague Kane. Batman helps Zatanna clear her name, and by the end of their confrontation with Kane, she realizes Batman is really \&quot;John Smith\&quot;. At the end of the episode, the two promise to keep in touch, as dear friends.\n** Zatanna makes two appearances in the &#39;&#39;[[Gotham Girls]]&#39;&#39; flash animation episodes, voiced by [[Stacie Randall]]. In \&quot;A Little Night Magic\&quot;, Zatanna walks home on her own after a magic show and has some adventures on the way: She turns a robber&#39;s gun into a snake, splits a truck in half when it almost runs her over, and turns some street thugs into toads after they take her hat. In \&quot;Hold the Tiger\&quot;, Zatanna stops Catwoman from stealing the Cat&#39;s Eye Opals from a jewelry store. Zatanna does not arrest Catwoman but instead asks for help in finding her [[white tiger]].\n** Zatanna made a cameo appearance in &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond]]&#39;&#39;. In the episode \&quot;Out of the Past\&quot;, an elderly Bruce Wayne is looking through a collection of pictures on his computer of past loves, alongside [[Lois Lane]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Barbara Gordon]].\n** Zatanna reappears in the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]] (in \&quot;This Little Piggy\&quot;) and by [[Juliet Landau]] (in \&quot;The Balance\&quot;, albeit uncredited). In \&quot;This Little Piggy\&quot;, she helps Batman search for [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] after the villainess turned [[Wonder Woman]] into a pig. Zatanna is apparently aware of Batman&#39;s true identity since her last appearance (\&quot;Bruce! I haven&#39;t seen you for so long...\&quot;) and knows well enough to perceive the Dark Knight&#39;s romantic relationship with Wonder Woman. It&#39;s revealed that after her encounter with Batman that she somehow came across actual magic power, which she now uses to help people as a crimefighter and secretly uses them at the same time during her magic show tours for public entertainment. Like her comic book counterpart, her spells are often cast backwards, but almost equally often cast without words, and on one occasion, speaking normally. Zatanna also appeared in \&quot;The Balance\&quot; amongst the magic-based superheroes affected by the disturbance in the magical balance. In \&quot;Destroyer\&quot;, Zatanna appears as one of many [[Justice League]] members called to help fight the invading [[Apokolips|Apokoliptan]] forces. DCAU writer [[Paul Dini]] wrote both of Zatanna&#39;s appearances described above. In 1998, [[Alan Burnett]] told &#39;&#39;[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]&#39;&#39;: \&quot;Paul Dini wanted to use Zatanna because he\u2019s secretly in love with her. It\u2019s something we try not to talk about too much\&quot;.\n[[File:ZatannaCM.jpg|thumb|Teenage Zatanna in &#39;&#39;Cartoon Monsoon&#39;&#39;]]\n* Two episodes of a Cartoon Monsoon contest entry feature Zatanna as a teenage hero who is a cross between &#39;&#39;[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Buffy Summers|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. This saw her match wits with [[Klarion the Witch Boy]], and featured her father (referred to only as \&quot;Zatara\&quot;) as well as the new character of Zatanna&#39;s older, non-magic-wielding brother (named \&quot;Damon\&quot; in the second episode).\n* Zatanna appears in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39;, with Jennifer Hale reprising her role. In the teaser of \&quot;Chill of the Night!\&quot;, she and Batman stop [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] from robbing a museum exhibit displaying the history of magicians. Though she relies primarily on vocal spells, she is shown to be able to effectively wield Kadabra&#39;s magic wand after Abra gags her mouth shut and when she tries to remove it she pulls out a stream of handkerchiefs stuffed in her mouth. Zatanna gets Kadabra&#39;s wand and makes the handkerchiefs disappear, then snaps the wand. While Batman holds back the mind control slaves, Zatanna battles Kadabra, and traps Abra in her hat. She later pulls out a tiny bird cage with Kadabra in it, winning the magic battle. This version wears a slightly modified version of her original outfit, with her trademark fishnets replaced by purple tights.\n* Zatanna appears in the &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]&#39;&#39; cartoon series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2011/09/new-young-justice-batman-the-brave-and-the-bold-october-2011-episode-details/|title= New &#39;&#39;Young Justice,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Batman: The Brave And The Bold&#39;&#39; October 2011 Episode Details|first= Jim|last= Harvey|date= September 27, 2011|publisher= Worldsfinestonline.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233017/http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2011/09/new-young-justice-batman-the-brave-and-the-bold-october-2011-episode-details/|archivedate= April 26, 2014|url-status= live|accessdate= April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]]. This version is only thirteen years old, and as such her romantic entanglements involving Batman are instead transferred to Robin. In the episode \&quot;Humanity\&quot;, Zatara initially brings Zatanna to Mount Justice in [[Happy Harbor]] to meet the team, and asks the kids give Zatanna a tour of Mount Justice. They pretend to go along with that request, quickly use [[Miss Martian]]&#39;s ship to leave the cave and track down [[Red Tornado]] with Zatanna, referring to her departure with them as \&quot;kidnapping\&quot;. Zatara was displeased that his daughter went on a mission with the team. Robin seems to have an interest in her. She returns in the episode \&quot;Secrets\&quot;, where she and [[Tigress (DC Comics)#In other media|Artemis]] head to [[Manhattan]] on Halloween night. They are ambushed and eventually kidnapped by [[Harm (comics)|Harm]], a psychotic teenager wielding the mystical sword of [[Beowulf]], who then binds and gags Zatanna. While Harm interrogates Artemis, Zatanna fruitlessly attempts to conjure a spell through her gag. The ghost of Harm&#39;s murdered sister, [[Secret (Greta Hayes)|Secret]], soon appears and removes the tape from Zatanna&#39;s mouth, allowing her to rescue Artemis. Together, the three girls defeat Harm and allow Secret&#39;s spirit to move on to the afterlife. Afterwards, Zatanna promises to erect a proper grave for Secret, who had previously been buried in Harm&#39;s backyard. In episode \&quot;Misplaced\&quot;, Zatanna is with the team when all the adults disappear. She is able to use a spell to locate [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] on Roanoke Island. As her powers seem ineffective against Klarion (he refers to them as \&quot;baby magic\&quot;), she dons the Helmet of Fate as a last-ditch effort. After Klarion escapes, Nabu refuses to relinquish Zatanna as his host, until her father offers himself as Nabu&#39;s host. After making Batman promise to take care of her, Zatara dons the helmet and leaves Zatanna with the rest of the team. She then moves into Mount Justice with Miss Martian and Superboy and joins the team full-time. She is shown to be clearly devastated by the loss of her father. In \&quot;Happy New Year\&quot;, she and [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]] are now shown as adult members of the Justice League. In the episode \&quot;Depths\&quot;, Nightwing implies a past romantic relationship between them to explain why she was willing to provide him with an enchanted amulet without asking for its purpose. In \&quot;Satisfaction\&quot;, Zatanna and Miss Martian attend Rocket&#39;s bridal shower, and fight Captain Cold alongside Bumblebee, Black Canary, Wonder Girl, and Batgirl. In the episode \&quot;Cornered\&quot;, Zatanna, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and the team battle [[Despero]] in the Hall of Justice. She helps by possessing [[Mal Duncan|Mal]] and backfiring Despero&#39;s powers on himself. In \&quot;Intervention\&quot;, she assists Rocket in capturing [[Jamie Reyes|Blue Beetle]] and releasing him from the Reach.\n* Zatanna appears in &#39;&#39;[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]&#39;&#39;. In episode 46, Zatanna is among the superheroes that ask Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called \&quot;Super Friends\&quot;. In episode 50, Zatanna (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) appears on a skit called \&quot;Potions 11\&quot; where she teams up with [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], [[Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] for their heist.\n* Zatanna appears only in the intro of the &#39;&#39;[[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special]]&#39;&#39; with the Justice League.\n* Zatanna appears in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Action]]&#39;&#39;, with Lacey Chabert reprising the role while her child form is voiced by [[Dayci Brookshire]]. In the episode \&quot;Zombie King\&quot;, she and [[Swamp Thing]] help Batman fight Solomon Grundy when he raises an army of zombies with a magical gem. In \&quot;Trick or Threat\&quot;, she, Batman, Doctor Fate, and John Constantine are turned into children by Klarion the Witch Boy so that he can lure them into a trap at the House of Mystery and steal the Helmet of Fate. In \&quot;Speed Demon\&quot;, Zatanna helps Batman defeat Harley Quinn who had been enchanted by Brother Night. During the confrontation with Brother Night, Ember, and the rest of Brother Night&#39;s followers, Brother Night enchants the Batmobile where it wraps and gags, Zatanna while separating her from her hat and takes her on a ride causing Batman to enlist Etrigan the Demon for help. After Batman and Etrigan the Demon free Zatanna and have both the enchanted Batmobile and the ice cream truck that was enchanted by [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]] teleported to Brother Night&#39;s lair, Brother Night and his followers get away as Batman and Zatanna claim the enchanted orb that Brother Night used on the Batmobile that he left behind. In the episode \&quot;Hat Trick\&quot;, Zatanna was helping Batman and Jason Blood fight the possessed mannequins until Felix Faust appears and makes off with her hat. Upon tracing Felix Faust to the [[Hebrides]], Batman, Zatanna, and Etrigan the Demon are transported there by Merlin. Once there, they find that Felix Faust is using Zatanna&#39;s hat to summon the demon [[Demons Three|Ghast]] on the world as a way to regain his youth. Once that was done, Zatanna engages Felix Faust in battle while Batman and Etrigan the Demon work to prevent Ghast from reaching the mainland. As Felix Faust animates a gargoyle, Zatanna uses every trick in her arsenal where she destroys the gargoyle and chains Felix Faust up with the chains she conjured. Once Zatanna regains her hat, she casts a spell to send Ghast back to where he came from.\n* Zatanna appears as a central protagonist in the &#39;&#39;[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]&#39;&#39; TV series. The voice role is reprised by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. In this series, she&#39;s a teenager at Metropolis High, has purple hair and is both a dramatic fashionista (providing [[Wonder Woman]] with her alter ego as Greek exchange student, Diana Prince) and an entertainer for birthday parties. While Zatanna&#39;s personality is based on her &#39;&#39;Young Justice&#39;&#39; counterpart, she is not a rebel type but still loves her father.\n* Zatanna has a minor, non-speaking role in &#39;&#39;[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]&#39;&#39;. In \&quot;So You Need A Crew?\&quot;, she appears in a flashback where she helps the Justice League defeat the [[Queen of Fables]] by sealing her in a U.S. Master Tax Guide Book. In \&quot;The Line\&quot;, a court order forces her to release Queen of Fables from the book. In \&quot;A Fight Worth Fighting For\&quot;, Zatanna is called by Batman to release the other members of the Justice League, who were prievously imprisoned in a book by the Queen of Fables, before leaving with them to defeat [[Doctor Psycho]] and his army of [[Parademon|Parademons]].\n\n====Live-action====\n[[File:Serinda Swan as Zatanna Zatara.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Serinda Swan]] as Zatanna Zatara in &#39;&#39;Smallville&#39;&#39;.]]\nZatanna is a recurring character in the final three seasons of &#39;&#39;[[Smallville]]&#39;&#39;, portrayed by actress [[Serinda Swan]], marking her first appearance in live-action. The character first appeared late in [[Smallville (season 8)|season eight]], in the episode \&quot;Hex\&quot;. She is described as the daughter of the deceased [[John Zatara]], \&quot;the world&#39;s greatest magician\&quot;. Zatanna is introduced at the Ace of Clubs, the scene of [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]])&#39;s birthday party. To enliven things, Zatanna uses magic to make characters&#39; inner desires come true\u2014Chloe is physically transformed to resemble her cousin, [[Lois Lane]] ([[Erica Durance]]), for example, and [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark]] ([[Tom Welling]]) becomes \&quot;normal\&quot;. Zatanna later approaches [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) and offers him a deal: she will grant him a wish if he returns her father&#39;s magical book to her. Once she acquires the Book of Zatara from Green Arrow, whom she recognizes as Oliver, she reveals her aim is to use it to resurrect her father. Because Clark is vulnerable to magic, and Oliver lacks the power to stop her, Zatanna has to realize for herself that her father sacrificed himself so she could live. She later goes to Oliver to explain herself, and decides to help him if he encounters any supernatural foes along the way by leaving him her phone number. Swan reprises the role in the [[Smallville (season 9)|ninth season]] of &#39;&#39;Smallville&#39;&#39; in the episode titled \&quot;Warrior\&quot;. In [[Smallville (season 10)|season ten]] episodes which feature the government attempting to hunt down the [[Justice League (Smallville)|Justice League]], Zatanna&#39;s picture is shown among their targets. Although not portrayed by Swan, an actor in costume represents Zatanna in the episode \&quot;Icarus\&quot;. In the episode \&quot;Fortune\&quot;, Zatanna is used as a plot device; the episode establishes her as having sent an enchanted bottle of wine to Clark and Lois on the night of their engagement party, which sets the events of that episode in motion.\n\n===Film===\n====Live action====\n* In 2005, screenwriter Hadley Davis (&#39;&#39;[[Ice Princess]]&#39;&#39;) announced that she had written an action-comedy featuring a teenaged version of Zatanna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Davis Conjures Zatanna|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire2005/index.php?category=0&amp;id=30663|work=Sci Fi Wire|publisher=[[Syfy|Sci Fi]]|accessdate= April 25, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031214705/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire2005/index.php?category=0&amp;id=30663|archivedate=October 31, 2005|date=March 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing further was ever heard about this project, and it is presumed to have been abandoned.\n* Zatanna is one of the main characters for the film &#39;&#39;Justice League Dark&#39;&#39; (based on the [[Justice League Dark|superhero team of the same name]]), part of [[DC Extended Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://screenrant.com/justice-league-dark-movie-dc-shared-universe/|title= Guillermo del Toro: &#39;&#39;Justice League Dark&#39;&#39; is Part of DC\u2019s Shared Movie Universe|first= Ben|last= Kendrick|date= December 3, 2014|publisher= Screen Rant|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150906022604/http://screenrant.com/justice-league-dark-movie-dc-shared-universe/|archivedate= September 6, 2015|url-status= live|quote= Guillermo del Toro: &#39;Right now the only sort of shared universe project I\u2019m working on is &#39;&#39;Dark Universe&#39;&#39; for Warners, you know, for DC, which is Swamp Thing, Demon, Deadman, Zatanna.&#39;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/28/guillermo-del-toro-gives-justice-league-darkdark-universe-script-to-warner-bros|title= Guillermo del Toro Gives &#39;&#39;Justice League Dark&#39;&#39;/&#39;&#39;Dark Universe&#39;&#39; Script to Warner Bros.|first= Anthony|last= Couto|date= November 28, 2014|publisher= [[IGN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150109152940/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/28/guillermo-del-toro-gives-justice-league-darkdark-universe-script-to-warner-bros|archivedate= January 9, 2015|url-status= live|quote= The basis for &#39;&#39;Dark Universe&#39;&#39; \u2013 the comic book series &#39;&#39;Justice League Dark&#39;&#39; \u2013 features supernatural characters from the DC lore, including Zatanna, Deadman, Frankenstein, Swamp Thing, and notably, John Constantine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* In 2019, Zatanna was rumored to appear in [[James Gunn]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]&#39;&#39;, the sequel to [[David Ayer]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]&#39;&#39;, however Gunn debunked the rumour saying he \&quot;never considered Zatanna being in the film [The Suicide Squad]\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/suicide-squad-2-zatanna-rumors-debunked-james-gunn/amp/|title=James Gunn Never Even Considered Zatanna For Suicide Squad 2|website=Screenrant|date=September 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Animation====\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]&#39;&#39;, a evil version of Zatanna appeared on a computer page of the lesser members of the [[Crime Syndicate]].\n* A character with a design based on the &#39;&#39;Young Justice&#39;&#39; version of Zatanna, along with [[Tigress (DC Comics)#Artemis Crock|Artemis]], [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], and [[Miss Martian]], makes a cameo appearance as home viewers in &#39;&#39;[[Scooby-Doo!
