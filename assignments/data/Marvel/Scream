The Scream symbiote has appeared in ''[[Spider-Man (comic book series)|Spider-Man]]'' comics, as one of five [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] spawns created simultaneously and has had four different types.\n\n==Publication history==\nScream first appeared in ''[[Venom: Lethal Protector]]'' #4 (May 1993), and was created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Ron Lim]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=310}}</ref>\n\n==Hosts==\n=== Donna Diego ===\n[[File:LifeFoundationSymbiotes.jpg|thumb|left|Scream (Donna Diego; far left) alongside [[Riot (comics)|Riot]], [[Agony (comics)|Agony]], [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]] and [[Phage (comics)|Phage]] in ''[[Venom: Lethal Protector]]'' #4 (May 1993). Art by [[Ron Lim]].]]\nThe Scream symbiote was one of the five symbiotes that were forcefully spawned from the original [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote, and was their unofficial Californian leader. '''Donna Diego''' was a volunteer for the [[Life Foundation]], a survivalist group within the American government preparing both for the [[mutual assured destruction|mutually assured destruction]] fallout of the [[Cold War]] and to provide a comfortable life for wealthy clients after the impending [[nuclear holocaust]]. [[Carlton Drake]] was experimenting with [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]] in the hopes of creating so-called 'super-cops' to watch over the imagined fallout shelter utopia, and Donna was picked from the security force made up of [[police]], [[soldier]]s and [[mercenary|mercenaries]].<ref name = \"LetPro\">''Venom: Lethal Protector'' #1-6</ref> During Scream's first public appearance, she encountered [[Spider-Man]] while terrorizing a shopping mall near [[Salinas, California]]. Quickly bested by the more experienced fighter, Scream escaped in a [[hovercraft]] which returned to the Life Foundation's base.<ref name = \"LetPro\"/> Unknown to her, Spider-Man had hitched a ride on that same hovercraft. Once Spider-Man helped [[Eddie Brock]] escape, Scream and the other guardian symbiotes, [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]], [[Phage (comics)|Phage]], [[Riot (comics)|Riot]] and [[Agony (comics)|Agony]], then tangled with Spider-Man and Venom, but Venom turned an accelerated aging device on the five. The age-accelerating machine appeared to make the symbiotes age to dust before the Life Foundation blew up the base.<ref name = \"LetPro\"/>\n\nIt was later revealed that Scream and her \"siblings\" survived, as the Life Foundation was able to save them and their symbiotes. All of a sudden for some reason, the guardians had a falling out with their employers and now were [[fugitive]]s on the run. Scream led the others to [[New York City]] in search of Venom, hoping to help teach the five how to control their symbiotes. Venom wanted nothing to do with them, and battled Scream. When Venom disappeared, Scream attempted to enlist the [[Ben Reilly|Scarlet Spider]] to help find Venom. When Scarlet Spider refused, Scream experienced a [[psychotic break]] and began a rampage in [[Times Square]]. Humiliated when Venom ripped pieces of her symbiote off her and narrowly saved by the Scarlet Spider, Scream disappeared again.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #52</ref><ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #119</ref>\n\nUndiscouraged, Scream rounded up her \"siblings\" and broke Brock out of prison, kidnapping and imprisoning Brock in a [[Chicago]] [[warehouse]]. She once again asked for Brock's help in learning to communicate with the symbiotes. Brock once again refused and tried to kill them all, even without the Venom symbiote as back up. Brock escaped, and soon after the \"sibling\" symbiotes were murdered, one by one. Scream led them to believe that Brock was the killer, while in fact, it had been her the entire time. She had come to the conclusion that all symbiotes are evil, and those that bonded with symbiotes deserved to die.<ref name = \"SepAnx\">''Venom: Separation Anxiety'' #1-4</ref> It was revealed that Donna was [[mental illness|mentally ill]] and had been [[schizophrenia|hearing voices]] long before she was the Scream symbiote's host. Brock managed to re-bond with the Venom symbiote before Scream could go for the kill. While unable to prevent her from murdering every other symbiotes' host, Venom was nevertheless able to beat her in combat yet again and Scream was taken in by the authorities.<ref name = \"SepAnx\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[Planet of the Symbiotes|symbiote invasion]] of Earth, Donna was one of the few remaining symbiotes on Earth. Seeking to redeem herself for her crimes, she busied herself tracking down and helping benevolent symbiotic survivors. After her companions began dying mysteriously, Donna tracked [[Xenophage (comics)|Xenophage]], a huge alien that devours both symbiotes and their hosts' brains. Donna assisted Venom in slaying the Xenophage but was gravely injured.<ref>''Venom: The Hunted'' #1-3</ref>\n\nAfter her recovery, Scream sought out the Xenophage's hidden ship to help her track down more symbiotic survivors. The ship transported her and others (including Venom and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]) into another dimension where Scream gets nearly killed once again by the villainous mutants Dirtnap and [[Chimera (Marvel Comics)|Chimera]]. Upon her successful return to Earth, she disappeared, presumably to continue her search for the few remaining symbiotes.<ref>''Venom: Tooth & Claw'' #1-3</ref>\n\nScream appeared in two panels of the [[Islands of Adventure|Marvel Super Hero Island Adventures]] comic [[promotion (marketing)|giveaway]] from 1999, as she is shown to be a member of the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. She is referred to as Scream in the comics for the first time. Donna's [[family name]] Diego is first established (many years after her first appearance as a character in the Marvel Universe) via files where she is quoted as being an \"enemy combatant\" to the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]]'s forces.<ref name=\"civilwarbattledamage\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>\n\nScream is next seen investigating the murder of Scott Washington (aka the symbiotic hero [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]]). She is trapped by Brock. With the Scream symbiote incapacitated by a sonic device, Brock uses a super-heated knife to kill Donna.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 2 #15</ref>\n\n=== Patricia Robertson ===\n{{Main|Patricia Robertson (comics)}}\nDuring \"Absolute Carnage\", the Scream symbiote (still bonded to Donna's corpse after having absorbed Donna's consciousness) is resurrected by [[Knull (comics)|Knull]] and goes to help [[Cletus Kasady|Carnage]] harvest the codices of previous civilians who at some point had been bonded to symbiotes. Patricia Robertson (who had previously hosted a clone of Venom) later ambushes but the Scream symbiote decides to bond to her, leaving Donna's bones behind. Patricia struggles for control, but eventually the Scream symbiote forces Patricia to hunt other previous hosts.<ref>''Absolute Carnage: Scream'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Andi Benton===\n{{Main|Mania (character)}}\nPersuading the Scream symbiote to resist Knull's control a second time, Patricia sacrificed herself in an attempt to save Andi Benton, and the Scream symbiote bonded to Andi. Transformed into a black-haired version of Scream, Andi breaks free of the meathook and feels the Scream symbiote healing her wounds; reveling in the power of being bonded to a symbiote once more. Andi notes that she can feel not only the Scream symbiote's mental voice, but those of Carnage's doppelg\u00e4nger horde. She feels Carnage trying to compel her to obey, but sneers that she never liked doing what she was told. Snaring Carnage's arm with tendril-hair, Scream unleashes a torrent of hellfire from her maw - blasting Carnage in the face. Retorting that Carnage thought she would have remembered immunity to fire after their last encounter, Carnage attempts to impale the new Scream like with Patricia, but she leaps over her opponent. Lunging at her, Carnage impales Scream and snarls that he's the voice inside her head telling her to stay and die. Scream snares with tendril hair and slams Carnage into the dangling meat, Andi noting that even with a symbiote she's not powerful enough to fight. Lamenting that she hadn't even known Patricia's name before the Scream symbiote bonded to her, Andi vows not to let Patricia's sacrifice be in vain. Cocooning Carnage in her hair, Scream tosses Carnage into a meat locker, slams the door and flees. Smashing the door off its hinges, Carnage notes that Andi has escaped and grouses of having to wait for another rematch with her before turning to harvest the Mania and Scream codices from Patricia's corpse.<ref>''Absolute Carnage: Scream'' #2-3. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDonna Diego's superhuman abilities stem from the Scream symbiote. Scream often uses her 'hair' as a weapon to wrap or tangle enemies (much like [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] of the [[Inhumans]]), and can mimic clothing as camouflage. Like Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote, Scream has wall-crawling and web-slinging abilities, and boasts an early-warning sense. Scream also possesses some degree of superhuman strength but the exact limits of which are unknown.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\nScream will appear in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man: Maximum Venom]]'', voiced by [[Meg Donnelly]]. She was first mentioned in \"The Secret Story of Venom\" as one of the '''Symbiote Sisters''', the first creations of the eldritch god '''[[Knull (comics)|Knull]]''', alongside All-Black, [[Scorn (comics)|Scorn]], and [[Mania (symbiote)|Mania]]. They, alongside [[Venom (Marvel Comics)|Venom]] himself, will be the main antagonists of the season.<ref>[https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/marvels-spider-man-maximum-venom-debut-april-19-disney-xd-disneynow Spider-Man: Maximum Venom Debut at Marvel.com]</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Scream (Donna Diego) appeared as a boss character in ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Separation Anxiety]]''.\n* Scream (Donna Diego) appears as a boss character in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''.\n* Scream (Donna Diego) appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]''.\n\n===Theme parks===\nScream (Donna Diego) appears in the [[Islands of Adventure]] ride ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Candi Milo]].
