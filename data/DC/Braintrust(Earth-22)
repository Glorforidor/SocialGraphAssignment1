Created by Ken Fitch and [[Bernard Baily]], his first appearance was in [[Action Comics 1|&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #1]] (June 1938), the same comic that introduced [[Superman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=Americommando |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/mramer.htm |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |accessdate=1 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThompson is originally a blond-haired [[Texas]] boy who leaves a possible future as an [[oil]] baron to pursue a more adventurous lifestyle with his friend, Bob Daley. This changes in issue #33 (Feb 1941)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/mramer.htm |title=Mr. America}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Kriegsmarine|Nazis]] sink an American liner carrying food to Europe. Thompson is watching over this liner and is believed dead. The disaster inspires him to don a patriotic costume, dye his hair black, and wield a [[whip]] to fight for his country as Mr. America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/146 |accessdate=1 April 2020 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nAs Mr. America, Thompson also had a [[flying carpet]] which doubled as a cape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=misteramerica Unofficial Mister America Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; His friend Bob Daley dons a homemade costume (similar to that of the original [[Red Tornado (Ma Hunkel)|Red Tornado]]) and becomes his [[sidekick]], Fat Man, wielding a broom against the forces of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAccording to &#39;&#39;Jess Nevins&#39; Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes&#39;&#39;, Mr. America \&quot;explores lost cities, fights ape armies, woos the Queen of the Malays, has a recurring nemesis in the person of the cyclopean [[Yellow Peril]] Gorrah, fights zombies, island demons, spies, the half-German, half-Japanese dwarf \&quot;master of assassination\&quot; Dr. Ito, and the female crime lord Queen Bee, and he kills lots of Germans and Japanese during the war\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |pages=269-270}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBob&#39;s daughter, Janice, also adventured with the heroes under the secret identity of [[Miss X (character)|Miss X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=Miss X |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/miss-x.htm |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |accessdate=22 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Americommando===\nMr. America was a member of the [[All-Star Squadron]], but his main contribution to the war effort came later; Thompson is asked by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] himself to go battle the Nazis in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] as The Americommando.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Roy |title=The All-Star Companion: Vol 2 |date=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1893905375 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson does this by becoming \&quot;Hauptmann Riker\&quot; and infiltrating the [[Gestapo]]. His most frequent adversaries are Mister Ito (also known as The Little One), a German/[[Japan]]ese diminutive assassin, and The Queen Bee. He works for the Americans for several years behind enemy lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/jsa/3.1_allstars.html Cosmic Teams: All-Stars]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHis last appearance as The Americommando is in &#39;&#39;The Justice Society Returns: National Comics&#39;&#39; #1: [[Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane)|Mr. Terrific]] encounters Thompson during the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] and the two work together to save innocent German lives. After Thompson reveals to Mr. Terrific that there are no munitions factories in Dresden for the Allies to bomb, Thompson enters a burning building to save a small girl. The building collapses around him and he is never seen again.\n\n===Hero Hotline===\nOnce again Thompson managed to escape death; he later emerges to create the [[Hero Hotline]] organization. While leading this organization, Thompson goes by the name The Coordinator. He only appeared as a shadowy figure on a communication screen, so no one knew that it was Thompson until it was revealed by the writer of Hero Hotline, Bob Rozakis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/bobro/99102600051629.htm It&#39;s BobRo, the Answer Man!]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTex Thompson has no superpowers but he is a well-trained spy and a great hand-to-hand combatant. He sometimes used a whip as his main weapon and a carpet that he altered with chemicals which allows him to fly and doubles as a cape when not in use.\n\n==Other versions==\n*In &#39;&#39;[[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]]&#39;&#39; #7 (March 1977), the villainous &#39;&#39;&#39;Silver Ghost&#39;&#39;&#39; poses as a fictional Americommando, leader of the [[Crusaders (DC Comics)|Crusaders]] (a parody of [[Captain America]] and the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]). This version of the character was the inspiration for the Earth-8 version and the modern Freedom Fighters villain.\n*In &#39;&#39;[[Lord Havok]] and the [[Extremists (comics)|Extremists]]&#39;&#39; #1\u20136, the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-8]] version of Americommando is leader of a group called the &#39;&#39;&#39;Meta-Militia&#39;&#39;&#39;, an analogue of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n*In &#39;&#39;[[Freedom Fighters (comics)#Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters|Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters]]&#39;&#39;, a new &#39;&#39;&#39;Americommando&#39;&#39;&#39; appears as an agent of [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#S.H.A.D.E.|S.H.A.D.E.]] and its field leader. He kills his own speedster, Spin Doctor, for talking back to him.\n*In &#39;&#39;[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]&#39;&#39;, an Americommando appears as a minor villain. After the destruction of Kansas, Americommando, along with Braintrust and the Minutemen, attempts to stop all immigration to the United States. He and his team are stopped by Superman and the Justice League.\n*In &#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #1, a new &#39;&#39;&#39;Mr. America&#39;&#39;&#39;\u2014&#39;&#39;&#39;Trey Thompson&#39;&#39;&#39;, an ex-[[FBI]] agent who took justice into his own hands\u2014debuts in the first issue and dies in the same issue. It is implied by [[Doctor Mid-Nite|Dr. Mid-Nite]] that Trey was related to the original Mr. America, when Mid-Nite says that Mr. America&#39;s bloodline was gone. However, Trey&#39;s former FBI contact, &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Jeffrey Graves]]&#39;&#39;&#39;, is later seen donning Mr. America&#39;s mask after he is fired when his connection with Trey is discovered.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #1\u20134: &#39;The Next Age&#39;&lt;/ref&gt; He later joins the Justice Society, and remains an active member. He also uses a whip, which is later upgraded by [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]] so that the tip explodes on impact.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; (Vol. 3) #34&lt;/ref&gt;\n*Tex Thompson played a central role in the &#39;&#39;[[The Golden Age (comics)|Golden Age]]&#39;&#39; miniseries. In this story, he is a crime-fighter who disappeared from the American eye in 1942 to fight the Nazi threat from within. He kills the German superhero [[Parsifal (DC Comics)|Parsifal]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] himself. He returns to America as a hero and becomes a [[United States Senate|senator]] with [[President of the United States|presidential]] aspirations. Then he organizes a program to defend America from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] menace with a new group of superheroes. He rallies [[Atom (Al Pratt)|The Atom]], [[Robotman (Robert Crane)|Robotman]], and [[Dan the Dyna-Mite|Daniel Dunbar]] to his cause. He uses a group of scientists to transform Dunbar into Dynaman, \&quot;a super-hero for the new age\&quot;. The heroes of the story discover that Tex Thompson had actually been killed in the war; the man who returned was the [[Ultra-Humanite]]. The Ultra-Humanite told Hitler that Thompson was a spy, so they killed Thompson and put Ultra&#39;s brain into his body. The experiment which created Dynaman was in reality the Humanite putting Hitler&#39;s brain in Dunbar&#39;s body. The Ultra-Humanite is stopped by [[Manhunter (comics)#Paul Kirk|Manhunter]], who had witnessed the operation, but suffered from memory loss after hitting his head trying to escape.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/mramer.htm Mr. America] at [[Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia]].
