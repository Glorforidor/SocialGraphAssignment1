First appearing in print in 1819, in [[John William Polidori]]&#39;s \&quot;[[The Vampyre]]\&quot;, he was one of the first [[vampire]]s in English literature. The name Ruthven was taken from [[Lady Caroline Lamb]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Glenarvon]]&#39;&#39;, where it was used as an unflattering parody of [[Lord Byron]], while the character was based on Augustus Darvell from Byron&#39;s \&quot;[[Fragment of a Novel]]\&quot;. \&quot;The Vampyre\&quot; was written privately, and published without Polidori&#39;s consent, with revisions to the story made by Polidori for an unpublished second edition showing that he planned to change the name from Ruthven to Strongmore.&lt;ref name=\&quot;macdonald\&quot;/&gt; The initial popularity of \&quot;The Vampyre\&quot; led to the character appearing in many translations and adaptations, including plays and operas, and Ruthven has continued to appear in modern works.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Clan member crest badge - Clan Ruthven.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Crest badge of [[Clan Ruthven]]]]\nThere is a genuine title of [[Lord Ruthven of Freeland]] in the [[Peerage of Scotland]] which is a subsidiary title of the [[Earl of Carlisle]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The fictional characters are not related to the historical title holders.\n\nThe name Ruthven was used for the title character in the 1816 [[Gothic novel]] &#39;&#39;[[Glenarvon]]&#39;&#39; by [[Lady Caroline Lamb]]. This character was based on the genuine [[Lord Byron]] and was not a vampire. Lady Caroline was a former lover of Lord Byron&#39;s and the novel did not offer a flattering portrait.\n\nThe character of Lord Ruthven in [[John William Polidori]]&#39;s \&quot;[[The Vampyre]]\&quot; was based on Augustus Darvell in Byron&#39;s \&quot;[[Fragment of a Novel]]\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Byron |first=George Gordon |author-link=Lord Byron |title=The Vampyre and Other Tales of the Macabre |editor-first=Robert |editor-last=Morrison |editor2-first=Chris |editor2-last=Baldick |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-955241-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn a copy of \&quot;The Vampyre\&quot; annotated by Polidori\u2014presumably for a revised second edition of the book which was never published\u2014the author changed the name of the vampire from \&quot;Lord Ruthven\&quot; to \&quot;Lord Strongmore\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;macdonald\&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=John William | last=Polidori | editor-first1=D.L. | editor-last1=Macdonald | editor-first2=Kathleen | editor-last2=Scherf | title=The Vampyre and Ernestus Berchtold | chapter=A Note on the Texts | page=35 | year=2008 | publisher=Broadview Editions }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==\&quot;The Vampyre\&quot;==\n{{main|The Vampyre}}\nLord Ruthven appeared as the title character in the 1819 short story \&quot;[[The Vampyre]]\&quot;. This had been written in 1816 by Dr. [[John William Polidori]], the traveling doctor of Lord Byron. It was published in the April 1, 1819 edition of &#39;&#39;[[The New Monthly Magazine]]&#39;&#39;. The publishers falsely attributed the authorship to Byron. Both Byron and Polidori disputed this attribution. In the following issue, dated May 1, 1819, Polidori wrote a letter to the editor explaining \&quot;that though the &#39;&#39;groundwork&#39;&#39; is certainly Lord Byron&#39;s, its development is mine.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beresford|first=Matthew|title=From Demons to Dracula: The Creation of the Modern Vampire Myth|year=2008|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-403-8|url=https://archive.org/details/fromdemonstodrac00bere|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/fromdemonstodrac00bere/page/121 121]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the story, a young Englishman, Aubrey, meets Lord Ruthven, a man of mysterious origins who has entered [[London]] society. Aubrey accompanies Ruthven to [[Rome]], but leaves him after Ruthven seduces the daughter of a mutual acquaintance. Aubrey travels to [[Greece]] where he becomes attracted to Ianthe, an innkeeper&#39;s daughter. Ianthe tells Aubrey about the legends of the vampire. Ruthven arrives at the scene and shortly thereafter Ianthe is killed by a vampire. Aubrey does not connect Ruthven with the murder and rejoins him in his travels. The pair are attacked by bandits and Ruthven is mortally wounded. Before he dies, Ruthven makes Aubrey swear an oath that he will not mention his death or anything else he knows about Ruthven for a year and a day. Looking back, Aubrey realizes that everyone who Ruthven met ended up suffering.\n\nAubrey returns to London and is amazed when Ruthven appears shortly thereafter, once again alive. Ruthven reminds Aubrey of his oath to keep his death a secret. Ruthven then begins to seduce Aubrey&#39;s sister while Aubrey, helpless to protect his sister, has a nervous breakdown. Ruthven and Aubrey&#39;s sister are engaged to marry on the day the oath ends. Aubrey writes a letter to his sister revealing Ruthven&#39;s history and dies. The letter does not arrive in time. Ruthven marries Aubrey&#39;s sister, kills her on their wedding night, and escapes.\n\nHis character is one typical of the gothic genre and [[Tables of vampire traits|vampires in general]]. His vampire character is alluring and sexual, but is also linked with horror and supernatural terror.\n\n==Subsequent appearances==\nThe story was an immediate success and several other authors quickly adapted the character of Lord Ruthven into other works. [[Cyprien B\u00e9rard]] wrote an 1820 novel, &#39;&#39;Lord Ruthwen ou les Vampires&#39;&#39;, which was falsely attributed to [[Charles Nodier]]. Nodier himself wrote an 1820 play, &#39;&#39;Le Vampire&#39;&#39;, which was adapted back into English for the London stage by [[James Planche|James Robinson Planch\u00e9]] as &#39;&#39;The Vampire, or The Bride of the Isles&#39;&#39;. At least four other stage versions of the story also appeared in 1820.\n\nIn 1828, [[Heinrich August Marschner]] and [[W. A. Wohlbr\u00fcck]] adapted the story into a German [[opera]], &#39;&#39;[[Der Vampyr]]&#39;&#39;. A [[Der Vampyr (Lindpaintner)|second German opera]] with the same title was written in 1828 by [[Peter Josef von Lindpaintner]] and [[C\u00e4sar Max Heigel]], but the vampire in Lindpaintner&#39;s opera was named Aubri, not Ruthven. [[Dion Boucicault]] revived the character in his 1852 play &#39;&#39;The Vampire: A Phantasm&#39;&#39;, and played the title role during its long run. [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]] also used the character in an 1852 play.\n\nA Lord Ruthven also exists in [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]]&#39;s novel, &#39;&#39;Lord of the Dead&#39;&#39;. Lord Ruthven is actually [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]].\n\nA Lord Ruthven also appeared in the Swedish novel &#39;&#39;Vampyren&#39;&#39; (1848), the first published work by author and poet [[Viktor Rydberg]]; as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that he is inspired by him in name only. This Ruthven is not a [[supernatural]] being, but a lunatic believing himself to be a vampire.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]&#39;&#39;, the main character [[Edmond Dant\u00e8s]] is often referred to as Lord Ruthven by a countess. The countess incorrectly attributes the creation of Ruthven to Byron.\n\nLord Ruthven appears as a main character in Nancy Garden&#39;s young adult book &#39;&#39;Prisoner of Vampires&#39;&#39;. In this story, Ruthven uses the name \&quot;Radu\&quot; and is a relation and helper of both Count Dracula and Carmilla.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nancygarden.com/books/booklist-awards.html&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLord Ruthven served as the inspiration for a 1945 film, &#39;&#39;[[The Vampire&#39;s Ghost]]&#39;&#39;, which was adapted into comic book format in 1973. Lord Ruthven also appears in the background of the &#39;&#39;[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]&#39;&#39; game system, under the name &#39;&#39;&#39;Lambach Ruthven&#39;&#39;&#39;.\n\n[[Kim Newman]] uses the character of Lord Ruthven in his [[alternate history]] [[Anno Dracula series|&#39;&#39;Anno Dracula&#39;&#39; series]], having Ruthven serve as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] after [[Count Dracula]] seizes the English throne. Ruthven holds the Premiership from c. 1886 until 1940, when he loses it to [[Winston Churchill]]. Ruthven later reclaims it following the war, losing it to Churchill again after the [[Suez Crisis]]. Ruthven later serves as [[Home Secretary]] under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and is poised to take over as Prime Minister again following her departure.\n\nRuthven also appeared in some [[Superman]] comics, notably in &#39;&#39;Superman: The Man of Steel&#39;&#39; #14 and #42 and &#39;&#39;[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]&#39;&#39; #70. He has also appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]. Originally, he appeared in the first issue of &#39;&#39;[[Vampire Tales]]&#39;&#39;, then as the possessor of the mystical book called &#39;&#39;[[Darkhold]]&#39;&#39;. An incidental character called Ruthven appears in later issues of [[Neil Gaiman]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]&#39;&#39; comic; this Ruthven is a man with a rabbit&#39;s head, as well as prominent \&quot;vampire\&quot; fangs.\n\nA comical \&quot;Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd\&quot; is the main character of Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Ruddigore]]&#39;&#39;. In it, the pastoral Robin Oakapple finds that he is descended from an evil uncle and is forced to take up his ancestor&#39;s evil ways.\n\nRuthven and [[Varney the Vampire|Sir Francis Varney]] are two of the main characters in Vivian Shaw&#39;s &#39;&#39;Strange Practice&#39;&#39; (2017) and its sequels. Ruthven&#39;s full name is &#39;&#39;&#39;Edmund Ruthven&#39;&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/vivian-shaw/strange-practice/|title=&#39;&#39;Strange Practice&#39;&#39; by Vivian Shaw|work=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|date=15 May 2017|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA human Lord Ruthven appears in the BBC television series &#39;&#39;[[Dracula (2020 TV series)|Dracula]]&#39;&#39; (2020).\n\nThe [[Lord Ruthven Award]] by the Lord Ruthven Assembly is named after the character.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060829003603/http://www.blackcoatpress.com/ruthven.htm Lord Ruthven books]\n\n{{The Vampyre}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ruthven, Lord}}\n[[Category:Fictional vampires]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1816]]\n[[Category:Fictional Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Characters in British novels of the 19th century]]\n[[Category:Male literary villains]]\n[[Category:Fictional lords and ladies]]&quot;</span>
