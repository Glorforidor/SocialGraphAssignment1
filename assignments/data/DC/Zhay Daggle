In pre-&#39;&#39;[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]&#39;&#39; continuity, he was the son of Legion financer [[R. J. Brande]], a Durlan who had become frozen in human form after contracting a disease&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secrets of the Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39; #3, March 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; and a female Durlan named Zhay.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39; #263, May 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reep did not learn that Brande was his father for many years; he and his twin sibling Liggt were raised by their maternal aunt Ji. As Durlans were viewed with suspicion by natives of Earth, Reep applied for membership in the Legion to set an positive example to counter that prejudice and found that the Legion agreed with his aims on top of his talents to induct him .&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secrets of the Legion of Super-Heroes&#39;&#39; #1, January 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks in part to his exceptional [[deductive reasoning|deductive skills]] he is named the permanent head of the Legion&#39;s Espionage Squad.\n\nChameleon Boy was sentenced to incarceration on the prison world Takron-Galtos for his espionage activities against the [[Khund]]s, and was released after his heroics in the [[Great Darkness Saga]].\n\n===&#39;&#39;Zero Hour&#39;&#39; Reboot===\nPost-Zero Hour, Reep was known simply as &#39;Chameleon&#39; and was not related to R. J. Brande. This time, he was the son of Durla&#39;s spiritual leader and heir to that title, though he long refused to accept it, believing he served his people better as part of the Legion.\n\n===2005 \&quot;Threeboot\&quot;===\nIn the 2005 reimagining/reboot of the Legion, the character was still referred to as Chameleon, but is now an [[androgynous]] humanoid. Chameleon can still shapeshift and is still a master detective. A minor difference to prior versions of the character is that his default form does not usually have visible antennae, although he produces them to analyze unfamiliar objects.\n\n===Post-Infinite Crisis===\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; Chameleon Boy is included in the Legion, but is considered \&quot;missing\&quot;; &#39;&#39;[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) #696 shows that Chameleon Boy has been posing as Control, a young woman who assists in running the Science Police in the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | writer = [[James Robinson (comics)|Robinson, James]] | artist = Chang, Bernard | coartists = Pina, Javier  | story = Man of Valor, Part Three  | title = [[Superman (comic book)]] | volume = 1 | issue = 696 | date = March 2010 | publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As revealed in &#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #8, Chameleon Boy is part of a secret team sent to the 21st century by the late RJ Brande to save the future in the &#39;&#39;[[Superman: Last Stand of New Krypton|Last Stand of New Krypton]]&#39;&#39; storyline.\n\nIn the \&quot;[[Watchmen]]\&quot; sequel \&quot;[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]],\&quot; Chameleon Boy is among the Legion of Super-Heroes members that appear in the present after [[Doctor Manhattan]] undid the experiment that erased the Legion of Super-Heroes and the [[Justice Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Doomsday Clock&#39;&#39; #12 (December 2019). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nChameleon Boy has the same shape-shifting ability that is innate among all his people. They can take the form of any object or organism their body can &#39;scan&#39; with their antennae and morph into it within seconds. Reep is able to shift into forms both larger and smaller than he is, creating or disregarding mass at whim. He can also elongate parts of his body with this excess mass creation, as well as rearrange his internal organs and tissue such as his eyes, nose, heart, etc. He is a skilled voice imitator to go along with his disguises. Because of these feats he is considered one of the most powerful and versatile Durlan shape-shifters.\n\n==Equipment==\nAs a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] he is provided a [[Legion Flight Ring]]. It allows him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n[[Image:LegionnairesSTAS.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Chameleon Boy as seen on &#39;&#39;Superman: TAS&#39;&#39;.]]\n* Chameleon Boy appeared in the &#39;&#39;[[Superman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;New Kids in Town\&quot;, voiced by [[Jason Priestley]].\n* Chameleon Boy later appeared in an episode of &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; titled \&quot;Far From Home\&quot;.\n* Chameleon Boy appears in the second season of &#39;&#39;[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Alexander Polinsky]]. In this series, Chameleon Boy is characterized as a generally humorous and wise-cracking character, similar to [[Beast Boy]] in the &#39;&#39;[[Teen Titans]]&#39;&#39; series, although he can be serious if necessary, and is prepared to defy Legion rules if he thinks they are unjust. Also like Beast Boy, he appears to be younger than his comic book counterpart and mostly turns into animals. In his first appearance he commented \&quot;My dad&#39;s rich, remember?\&quot; and later episodes confirmed that this was a reference to R. J. Brande.\n* In [[The CW]] series &#39;&#39;[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]&#39;&#39;, Chameleon is mentioned in the third season episode \&quot;[[List of Supergirl episodes#ep60|Shelter From the Storm]]\&quot; as a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes|Legion of Superheroes]] who was stricken by the Blight.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\nChameleon Boy is featured in the &#39;&#39;[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]&#39;&#39; digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]].\n\n==Cultural impact==\nAs a boy, comic writer [[Peter Hogan]] liked the design aesthetic of Chameleon Boy. When he and artist [[Steve Parkhouse]] were creating &#39;&#39;[[Resident Alien (comic book)|Resident Alien]]&#39;&#39;, Hogan specifically requested Parkhouse base the main character&#39;s appearance on the DC hero.&lt;ref name=\&quot;rf\&quot;&gt;Hickey, Patrick Jr (March 23, 2013), \&quot;[http://reviewfix.com/2013/03/review-fix-exclusive-interview-with-resident-alien-creator-peter-hogan/ Review Fix Exclusive: Interview With \u2018Resident Alien\u2019 Creator Peter Hogan],\&quot; Review Fix (accessed March 29, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070920200325/http://www.majorspoilers.com/archives/2392.htm/ A Hero History Of Chameleon Boy]\n\n{{Legion of Super-Heroes}}\n{{Superman characters}}\n[[Category:DC Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who are shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Fictional detectives]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1960]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jerry Siegel]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Mooney]]\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]&quot;</span>
