Polka-Dot Man

Polka-Dot Man (Abner Krill) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, primarily as a minor enemy of Batman, belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's rogues gallery.
Polka-Dot Man will make his cinematic debut in James Gunn's DC Extended Universe film The Suicide Squad in 2021, portrayed by David Dastmalchian.


== Publication history ==
The Polka-Dot Man first appeared in Detective Comics #300 (February 1962), created by writer Bill Finger and artist Sheldon Moldoff.


== Fictional character biography ==


=== Becoming the Polka-Dot Man ===
Shortly after Batman began appearing in Gotham City, his growing renown inspired an entire generation of costumed rogues who committed largely harmless crimes to attract his attention in the hopes of matching wits with the legendary vigilante. Among these was a local crook named Abner Krill, who decided, for reasons unknown, to launch a crime wave based on spots and dots in Gotham City, where he inevitably came into conflict with Batman and Robin. As Mister Polka-Dot, he wore a costume covered in spots; once removed from the costume, the spots could be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating deadly weapons and a bizarre escape vehicle. He succeeded in capturing Robin, but Batman defeated him.


=== Return to villainy ===
Years later, Krill (now calling himself the Polka-Dot Man) was driven to crime once more when he found himself unemployed, penniless, and desperate to pay his bills. No longer able to afford his original electronically gimmicked costume, he instead resorted to using a baseball bat in a poorly thought-out attempt to rob a jewelry store, which resulted in him assaulting Officer Foley of the Gotham City Police Department, causing minor injuries. He was then beaten badly by Detective Harvey Bullock, who was sick of costumed villains in the city. The assault put the Polka-Dot Man in traction and he filed a brutality suit against the police department, which resulted in Bullock being forced to see a psychiatrist.Following his recovery, Krill became a committed alcoholic who spent more time drinking himself into a stupor in sleazy bars than troubling Batman. The fact that Robin had tracked him down with a leopard became something of a running joke among other villains. As Nightwing, Dick Grayson encountered the Polka-Dot Man a second time when he trashed My Alibi, a bar known for underworld regulars who vouched for each other's whereabouts when they were off committing crimes. Nightwing pitched Krill through a window display and into the street, where he was picked up by the police.


=== Death ===
Later, Mister Polka-Dot (having resumed his original alias) reappeared with a new look, joining a group of villains working for General Immortus. Immortus, with the help of Professor Milo, upgraded the villains' powers and gadgets. As a follower of General Immortus, Mister Polka-Dot has presumably been operated upon by Professor Milo to internalize his technology. The group was undone when they were betrayed by the Human Flame. Most were killed in the brutal battle, including Mister Polka-Dot. His head was crushed after a manhole cover landed on it.


== Powers and abilities ==
When he created his costume, Abner Krill possessed advanced technology in the form of the costume's polka dots, which were controlled through the costume's belt. When attached to his costume, they were inert, but once removed, they would enlarge in size and become various different devices which could aid in his crime sprees, most notably a flying saucer which he used as a getaway vehicle.Gimmicked dots used by the Polka-Dot Man included:

Flying Buzzsaw Dot, a red polka dot designed as a projectile. The dot had a rotating interior mechanism upon which a circular saw blade was mounted.
Flying Saucer Dot, a yellow polka dot which expanded rapidly into a flat, man-sized glider. It was steered by a series of buttons or switches on the Polka-Dot Man's belt.
Sun Dot, a gold polka dot designed as a projectile. It was gimmicked to resemble a model of the sun and emitted a blinding, disorienting light similar to a flare.
Bubble Dot, a white polka dot which expanded into a translucent capsule capable of flight. Like the Flying Saucer Dot, it was steered by a belt apparatus.
Fist Dots were red, yellow, and orange polka dots designed as projectiles. They were thrown at once and gimmicked to resemble human fists. When bounced off opponents at close range and in concert, these dots could produce concussive effects.
Hole Dot, a black polka dot simply referred to as a "hole" by the Polka-Dot Man. It opened up what appeared to be a teleportation transport system and was presumably developed with assistance from General Immortus.
