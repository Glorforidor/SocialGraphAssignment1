They debuted in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]] and have appeared in Marvel publications for four decades.&lt;!-- The Celestials may have been inspired by the &#39;&#39;[[Chariots of the Gods?]]&#39;&#39;.--&gt;\n\nThe Celestials debuted in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] appearing in the film, &#39;&#39;[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]&#39;&#39; (2014).

The first detailed account of the Celestials&#39; origin was finally presented in &#39;&#39;Ultimates 2&#39;&#39; #6 (2017).\n\n== Fictional history ==\nThe origin of the Celestials has long been unknown, with many species across the [[Earth-616|mainstream]] [[Marvel Universe]] having only legends about their beginning, none of which have been validated. During the so-called &#39;&#39;[[Eternity War]]&#39;&#39;, there were major revelations about the origin and nature of the Celestials by the mysterious [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] called the Queen of Nevers.\n\nAt the beginning of creation itself, countless billions of years ago, before the current Cosmic Order, creation was composed of a single and sentient universe, whose omnipotent intelligence was referred to as the First Firmament. For countless ages, the First Firmament was the sole being in creation, until its loneliness became unbearable. It decided to create the first life in Creation to give it companions as well as servants\u2014an act that it would later come to regret. These servants were cosmic beings of a lesser order of power and were of two kinds: black and multicolored humanoid servants. The black servants dutifully obeyed and worshiped their creator. They even created their own servants and sought to preserve the simple order their creator had made complete and unchanging for all time. The First Firmament named these loyal beings Aspirants and was very pleased by their goals and desire to maintain the status quo of its reign. However, the multicolored ones had completely different values and desires from the Aspirants. Considered \&quot;rebels\&quot; by the First Firmament, they wanted a dynamic, diverse and continually evolving Reality where beings lived, learned, reproduced, aged and died in order to slowly improve themselves through evolution. The rebels wanted this with the ultimate long term goal of producing superior cosmic beings with the power to create universes of their own and for the universe to evolve with them as they advanced towards that state. These were the beings whom one day would be called by lesser life forms, \&quot;The Celestials\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;:0\&quot; /&gt;\n\nThe two opposing factions of the First Firmament&#39;s children could not peacefully co-exist and the ensuing war nearly destroyed the first universe. At some point during the war, the Aspirants created a now-lost hyper weapon called the Godkiller, a space-borne {{convert|25,000|foot}} tall humanoid robot that dwarfed even the Celestials themselves. It was powered by a cosmic artifact later called the Heart of The Voldi (named after the species which would adopt it) and operated by genetically engineered pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Kieron Gillen]]|penciller=[[Dale Eaglesham]] and [[Joe Bennett (artist)|Joe Bennett]]|inker=Scott Hanna|colorist=Guru-eFX|letterer=Joe Caramagna|editor=Mark Paniccia|story=The Secret Origin of Tony Stark, Iron Metropolitan|title=Iron Man|volume=5|issue=#11 - 18|date=June 5, 2013 \u2013 November 6, 2013|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, the Godkiller destroyed countless billions of Celestials and brought them to the brink of extinction. At this point, for unknown reasons, a civil war broke out among the Aspirants that led to the Godkiller being stripped of critical parts for weapons. This division within the Aspirants gave the Celestials a chance to recover and make their last stand. In the final battle against the Aspirants, the Celestials detonated their ultimate weapons that tore the First Firmament apart and very nearly killed it. In a desperate act of self-preservation, the core essence of the First Firmament took the surviving Aspirants and fled outside Reality. In the wake of its near destruction, the major fragments of the First Universe that were torn off coalesced into a new cosmic being, one with multiple realities composing it: Eternity. This was the birth of the second Universe and the First Multiverse. After the birth of the first Eternity, the \&quot;rebels\&quot; settled inside him, multiplied and began their vast plan to create and nurture transitory but evolving life on the newborn worlds within, a general outline of the basic plan the Celestials follow for shaping the evolution of life on a chosen planet after it develops primitive sentient life.&lt;ref name=\&quot;:0\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Al Ewing]]|penciller=[[Travel Foreman]]|colorist=Matt Yackey|letterer=Joe Sabino|editor=[[Alanna Smith]] and [[Tom Brevoort]]|title=The Ultimates|volume=2|issue=#6|date=June 2017|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis initial visit is called a First Host of Celestials, after the chosen planet has been judged to possess the needed properties for an effective \&quot;seeding\&quot;. The Celestials then return for follow-up visits or \&quot;Hosts\&quot;, during which they monitor the subject planet&#39;s progress and make whatever modifications or interventions they deem appropriate. These Hosts have been documented on Earth, and have also been found on many other planets throughout the universe. Other major examples include the Skrull homeworld,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Silver Surfer&#39;&#39; Vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; hundreds of millions of years ago, and numerous Sh&#39;iar worlds, such as Gladiator&#39;s homeworld.\n\n===First Host===\nCollecting a number of natives during the Stone Age, they then begin genetic experimentation that determines the future development of that species. They create three subspecies from the natives: [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]], and a majority \&quot;normal\&quot; strain that may or may not be modified in some manner that enhances its long term development. For example, the Celestials first visited Earth nearly a million years ago and implanted a special genetic code into the early hominids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Jack Kirby]]|penciller=Jack Kirby|inker=John Verpoorten and Mike Royer|colorist=Glynis Wein|letterer=Gaspar Saladino|editor=Jack Kirby, [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]]|title=Eternals|issue=#1 \u2013 12|date=July 1976 \u2013 June 1977|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implanted DNA structure has been revealed to be not only the source of the ability of select random humans to develop superpowers upon exposure to dangerous environmental catalysts, it also allowed for the development of benevolent mutations that caused the existence of inborn potential superpowers in [[Mutants (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mutant Fact Files&#39;&#39; #8.

Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Second Host===\nFor example, approximately 21,000 years ago, the Celestials returned to Earth for the Second Host and found that the Deviants had created a vast empire across the world based on the continent of Lemuria, where they had conquered most of the primitive human tribes with their superior technology. They were also about to go to war with the original human inhabitants of the neighboring continent of Atlantis. The Celestials then destroyed Lemuria and sank it under the ocean, utterly shattering the Deviants&#39; empire and indirectly sinking Atlantis-therefore destroying both continents and reshaping the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Steve Gerber]]|penciller=[[Sam Kweskin]]|inker=Syd Shores|colorist=Glynis Wein|letterer=Artie Simek|editor=[[Roy Thomas]]|title=Sub-Mariner|story=War of Atlantis|issue=#63|date=July, 1973|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Third and Fourth Host===\nResenting the presence of the Celestials and their monitoring of Earth&#39;s progress, the [[Sky father|Skyfather figures]] of Earth (i.e. [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]) attempted to stop the Third Host, but were quickly outmatched. The Space Gods then informed they would return 1,000 years later to judge Earth&#39;s right to continue existing.\n\nThe Skyfathers then developed a convoluted plan to stop the Fourth Host via the use of the [[Odinsword]] and [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] armour, but once again the Celestials prevented the offensive and melted the Destroyer armour into slag, scattering the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians&#39;]] life forces. The [[Mother goddess|Earthmothers]] (such as [[Frigga (Marvel Comics)|Frigga]] and [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]]) of Earth, however had planned a peaceful solution and made an offering of twelve perfect humans, which was accepted and the planet was spared judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Roy Thomas|penciller=[[Walt Simonson]]|inker=Ernie Chan|colorist=Glynis Wein|letterer=Tom Orzechowski|editor=Roy Thomas and [[Jim Shooter]]|title=Thor Annual|issue=#7|date= September 1978|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Roy Thomas, [[Ralph Macchio]] and [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller=[[John Buscema]] and [[Keith Pollard]]|inker=Chic Stone and Gene Day|colorist=George Roussos and Carl Gafford|letterer=Joe Rosen|editor=Roy Thomas and [[Jim Salicrup]]|title=Thor|issue=#283 \u2013 300|date=May 1979 - October 1980|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgment process on another planet was witnessed by Thor, who observed Celestial [[Arishem the Judge]] sending an execution code to [[Exitar the Exterminator]], a {{convert|20000|ft|m|adj=on}} tall Celestial who carried out Arishem&#39;s \&quot;sentence\&quot;.

This rebirth of the Multiverse had an unforeseen consequence: it provided an opening for the embittered First Firmament, who had been patiently waiting Outside, to attack the newly reborn, and therefore greatly weakened Eternity, with the goal of destroying the multiverse and restoring itself to the center of creation. The Firmament first chained and then began infiltrating Eternity with both its loyal Aspirant agents and taking control over the lesser cosmic entities that protected the cosmic balance in its component universes. Under the Firmament&#39;s influence, [[Master Order]] and [[Lord Chaos (comics)|Lord Chaos]] destroyed the reborn [[Living Tribunal]] in front of [[Galactus]] the Lifebringer and then found their servant, The In-Betweener and forcibly merged into a new cosmic being many orders of magnitude of power greater that called itself Logos. Logos then located the surviving Celestials and destroyed all but [[One Above All|one]] of them who was rescued by The Queen of Nevers.&lt;ref&gt;The Ultimates 2 #4-6 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The Fifth Host===\nLater, while observing the last stand against the First Firmament, The Queen of Nevers reveals the reason why she had saved the One Above All. By using him as a seed, she rises the Celestials anew as her own Avatars of Possible in what she claims to be the Fifth Host. The Celestials then faced and defeated the Aspirants of the First Firmament.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimates 2&#39;&#39; #100&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The Final Host===\nLater it was revealed during the Stone Age, a Celestial referred to as \&quot;The Fallen\&quot; came to Earth. It was described as \&quot;deranged\&quot; as it dug into the earth apparently searching for something. Due to the danger it posed, the Avengers of the Stone Age fought the Fallen and defeated it before burying it deep underground in the modern-day country of South Africa, where it was found and awakened by a group of archaeologists after they uncovered the cavern it was sealed in. The Fallen then summoned the Final Host while killing the archaeologists and soon afterwards was approached by Loki, the Asgardian God of Mischief, for unknown purposes.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ml 1\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Legacy&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The secret origin of the new Marvel Universe===\nSome time later Celestials began literally \&quot;raining\&quot; down on Earth forcing the Avengers to reunite again and just in time to see the arrival of the Final Host which is composed of Dark Celestials that are each physically unique and were the ones who easily took down their brethren.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 8) #1&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards it appeared that these Dark Celestials are in league with the Horde of bugs pouring out of the center of the planet and with Loki. In an attempt to learn more about the Celestials, Iron Man and Doctor Strange visited the Eternals, only to find them all dead or dying from self-inflicted wounds. Ikaris was found barely alive and used his last words to reveal to Iron Man that the Uni-mind was the only thing that can stop the Final Host from fully unleashing the Horde, as the existence of a dead Celestial that Loki calls the Progenitor is revealed.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 8) #4&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Progenitor is actually the first Celestial to ever set foot on Earth, when it was an insignificant speck of molten mud and utterly lifeless. He came to Earth not because of some grand cosmic design or godly destiny nor did he even consciously choose the planet, he came merely because he was dying and falling. As it turns out, even the omnipotent Celestials get sick, and the Progenitor was hopelessly infected by the Horde. As the Progenitor died, his blood and rotting flesh mixed into the shifting primordial elements of the newly-formed planet and thus affected the course of Earth evolution as it made the planet a unique breeding ground for all the super-powered beings one day to come.&lt;ref name=\&quot;av 8 5\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 8) #5&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n5 billion years after the death of the Progenitor and his corpse&#39;s incorporation into Earth&#39;s \&quot;primordial soup\&quot;, another Celestial eventually followed looking for him. This was The Fallen, who was known as Zgreb the Aspirant, the lover of the Progenitor and according to Loki, it became mad by the sight of its dead lover, or perhaps by the effect of the Horde latching onto him. In any event, Odin and his Prehistoric Avengers took on this Celestial, leaving it for dead deep in the Earth. Eventually, the disappearance of two Celestials brought down The First Host to Earth. They made quick work of the Prehistoric Avengers but left after the battle, rather than destroy the Avengers or the Earth. Loki surmises that the Celestials feared succumbing to the Horde themselves and believed it better to leave Zgreb buried deep underground to keep the Horde infection contained, creating in the process two opposing super\u2013 the Eternals and the Deviants - who have secretly been maturing the human race under the false impression that they were actually protecting them.\n\n===Dark Celestials===\nWhen Loki revived Zgreb from his long slumber deep in the Earth, he discovered that the Horde did not kill Zgreb, instead they transformed him into Zgreb the Sorrower, a new breed known as Dark Celestial. Together with the rest of his kind, collectively known as the Final Host, they&#39;ve killed or infected every other Celestial, the dead bodies of whom now litter the Earth, feeding the Horde.&lt;ref name=\&quot;av 8 5\&quot;/&gt;\n\nAs the entire planet panics due to the Final Host actions, the heroes finally realize why the Celestials didn&#39;t cleanse planet Earth when they had the chance, they saw the potential to grow an antidote to defeat the Horde and so they waited, visiting the planet now and then to see if the cure had been developed. Eventually the world breathes a sigh of relief as the Avengers, combining their powers through the Uni-Mind (given to Iron Man by Ikaris) purged the Earth of the Horde, defeating in the process the Dark Celestials.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers&#39;&#39; (vol. 8) #6&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Infinity Wars===\nIn the 2018 &#39;&#39;[[Infinity Wars]]&#39;&#39; event, as the Infinity Stones are gathered once again, Loki dupes his own version of the Infinity Watch within the Soul World, stealing the six Stones belonging to the main Marvel universe from Gamora. He does so in order to dive deep into the Quarry of the Gods at the end of time, believing unlimited power awaits him there. But as he enters, he discovers the Stones hold no power in the bottom of the quarry, becoming just ordinary rocks. More so, he sees the area littered with thousands of Stones, confirming that this quarry is where these powerful artifacts are originated and are being actively mined. Loki immediately recognizes the miners as a squad of unique Celestials (this new group could very well be the oldest of their kind) who are clearly manipulating the fate of the multiverse by spreading them out across all of the multiverse.\n\n== Known Celestials{{anchor|Members}} ==\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Arishem the Judge&#39;&#39;&#39;: A Celestial tasked with judging whether the civilization of a planet will live or die.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Ashema the Listener&#39;&#39;&#39;: A Celestial tasked, along with Nezarr the Calculator, with retrieving [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] for evaluation as a new member of the Celestials.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;The Blue Celestial&#39;&#39;&#39;: The first Celestial with a documented birth.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Callus the Void&#39;&#39;&#39;: One of the Celestials turned Dark Celestial.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Celestial Destructor&#39;&#39;&#39;: A member of the Aspirants, he was sent by the First Firmament to cause as much damage to [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].

They reproduce by planting a fragment of their essence in a planet, which matures into a new Celestial over the course of eons. As a form of protection of that growing Celestial, its \&quot;parents\&quot; would manipulate the DNA of a planet&#39;s dominant life form to gain super-abilities and unknowingly act as antibodies, protecting the planet until the Celestial is born.
