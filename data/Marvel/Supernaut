However, most would be a part of the new series though the designs of the characters were slightly altered.\n\nAs the cast of The Order is composed almost entirely of new characters, Fraction looked to a popular TV drama for ideas on how to acquaint readers with his protagonists.\n\n{{quote|I kind of went with the same kind of format they use on &#39;&#39;[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]&#39;&#39;.

Marvel allowed me to choose to leave the stage, rather than to continue on in a state in which I felt was compromised and decidedly unawesome.\n\nI don&#39;t think I was too clear about that on Word Balloon: it wasn&#39;t cancelled.
