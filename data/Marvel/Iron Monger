The first character to use the alias is '''Obadiah Stane''', who first appeared in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #163 (October 1982).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=352}}</ref> The Iron Monger armor first appeared in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #200 (November 1985).\n\n[[Jeff Bridges]] portrayed Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (2008) film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Luke McDonnell]], the first character to use is the alias is Obadiah Stane, who debuted in ''[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]'' #163 ([[1982 in comics#October|October 1982]]). The original Iron Monger armor that Stane wears makes its first appearance in ''Iron Man'' #200 ([[1980s in comics#November|November 1985]]), created by writer Dennis O'Neil and artist [[Mark Bright (comics)|Mark Bright]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Obadiah Stane===\nWhen '''Obadiah Stane'''  was a child, his [[Zebediah Stane|father]] was a degenerate gambler and Obadiah's mother had already died. One day, his father considered himself on a \"lucky streak\" and played a game of [[Russian roulette]] and shot himself in the head while young Obadiah watched. This [[psychological trauma|trauma]] caused Obadiah to go bald, and shaped his outlook on life. From then on, Stane was a ruthless manipulator who studied his adversaries to find weaknesses to exploit. Stane enjoys [[chess]], and lives his life with the same kind of methodical logic that he uses in the game. In addition, he is a strong believer in using [[psychological manipulation]] to his advantage. For instance, in a childhood [[chess]] match against another boy whose skill at least equaled his own, he killed the boy's dog so that the other would be distracted from the game.\n\nIn adulthood, Obadiah Stane becomes the President and CEO of his own company Stane International as a munitions dealer. He also goes into business with [[Howard Stark]]. After the elder Stark's death in a car accident, Stane turns his sights on acquiring control of [[Stark Industries|Stark International]] now owned by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] (Howard's son). Stane has his agents \u2013 known as the Chessmen \u2013 attack Stark Industries and assault [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] (Tony's confidant).<ref>''Iron Man'' #163\u2013165</ref> He also confronts the younger Stark in person.<ref>''Iron Man'' #166. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Stane also sets up Indries Moomji as Stark's lover without Stark knowing that Moomji is actually the Chessmen's Queen. Meanwhile, Stane and his associates conspire to lock Stark International out of various business deals. Stark eventually learns that Stane is the mastermind behind these attacks, but is unable to confront him. Stane's assaults on Stark's business and friends push Stark to the edge, relapsing into alcoholism.<ref>''Iron Man'' #167. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> With [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s help, Stane buys out Stark International which he renames Stane International. Stark (having fallen off the wagon) relinquishes Iron Man's armor to Rhodes and disappears to be a [[homelessness|homeless]] vagrant while Rhodes as Iron Man ignores Stane's demands to relinquish Iron Man's armor. Rhodes eventually thwarts Stane in his attempt to take over Iron Man's battle-suits.<ref>''Iron Man'' #173\u2013174. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>\n\nLooking through Stark Enterprises' records, Stane discovers Stark's notes on Iron Man's armor. The notes are incomplete and highly advanced, but Stane assigns a team of scientists to decipher; they eventually create the Iron Monger armor which is \"far superior to Stark's Iron Man armor\" according to Stane. He even considers selling the suit to the highest bidder or creating an army of Iron Mongers, using them to \"take over any country he wanted\".\n\nStane assigns the Termite to [[sabotage]] another business rival.<ref>''Iron Man'' #189. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> He also forms an alliance with [[Madame Masque]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #190. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>\n\nWhile living on the streets, Stark befriends pregnant homeless woman Gertl Anders who dies in childbirth, promising to protect the child which helps Stark overcome alcoholism to eventually confront Stane.<ref>''Iron Man'' #182</ref> Stark recovers, joining Rhodes and the Erwin twins (Morley and Clytemnestra) in starting a new company in [[Silicon Valley]],<ref>''Iron Man'' #184</ref> which is then dubbed Circuits Maximus.<ref>''Iron Man'' #188. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Stark builds a new prototype armor, resembling his original gray suit, to test new designs; Stark ends up using the armor to stop the out-of-control Rhodes,<ref>''Iron Man'' #191\u2013192</ref> and then to assist the [[West Coast Avengers]] against [[Doctor Demonicus]], while using the Avengers' facilities to construct the advanced [[Iron Man's Armor#Silver Centurion|Silver Centurion]] armor.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nRealizing that Stark is once again a potential threat, Stane orders [[Bethany Cabe]]'s abduction, and plans an attack to take out Iron Man whom Stane believes is currently either Rhodes or one of the Erwins. He sends an attack drone known as the Circuits Breaker to destroy Iron Man which both Rhodes and Stark are able to defeat. Stane further plots against Stark by switching the minds of Madame Masque and Cabe, and by abducting Stark's old friends ([[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]], [[Pepper Potts]] and Bambi Arbogast). Stane eventually detonates a bomb planted inside the Circuits Maximus [[Geodesic dome|dome]], killing Morley while wounding Rhodes and Clytemnestra.<ref>''Iron Man'' #195 \u2013 199. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>\n\nWhen Cly confronts Stark at the hospital, Tony faces Stane directly; Iron Man collects the newly completed Silver Centurion and flies to [[Long Island]]. Iron Man confronts Stane on Stane International's property and defeats Stane's agents, including the Chessmen who had proven a match for Iron Man's previous armor. Stane dons the Iron Monger armor and confronts Iron Man personally. The Iron Monger is more powerful than Iron Man's previous armor, but not the Silver Centurion model, which includes such features as the ability to absorb the heat from the Iron Monger's thermal rays and channel into the armor's own energy supplies. Stane tries to defeat Iron Man by tricking him into entering a room where Stark's friends (Happy, Pepper and Mrs. Arbogast) are being held in suspended animation tanks. The room's walls are covered with photo-electric cells that will send 200,000 volts into their bodies if Iron Man moves. Iron Man uses his armor's sensors to find the power source of Stane's trap, and destroys it with his chest-plate's uni-beam weapon.<ref>''Iron Man'' #200 (Nov 1985). Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>\n\nWith Stark's friends freed, Iron Man confronts Stane and the villain learns that even in the Iron Monger armor, he is no match for Stark. Finally, Stane uses his last card: Gertl Anders's infant son whom Stane had abducted from an orphanage. Stane tells Iron Man to remove the helmet or he will crush the baby. Having detected interfering frequencies in the armor systems throughout the battle, Iron Man deduces that Stane is not experienced enough to pilot the Iron Monger armor without some help via an external computer. Stark uses his armor's pulse bolts to destroy the building containing that computer, causing Stane's Iron Monger armor to seize up. Stane (refusing to be arrested and humiliated) fires his repulsor ray beam into his head, disintegrating his skull.<ref>''Iron Man'' #200</ref>\n\nWhen Stark would make a fresh start with the new company [[Stark Industries|Stark Enterprises]],<ref>''Iron Man'' #217 (Apr 1987)</ref> [[Justin Hammer]] would take control of Stane International and continue Stane's unethical business practices. It's only when Stark himself is confronted over those practices that learning of Hammer's ownership stake and forces to sell the company back to Stark.<ref>''Iron Man'' #281\u2013283 (Jun\u2013Aug 1992).

Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline, Stane in his Iron Monger armor was chosen as a member of [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]'s jury of the damned to decide the fate of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref> When the lord of Hades's power was undone, it was Iron Monger who laid the first blow, accompanied by the sound effect 'SHTAAANNE'.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #131.

Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>\n\nAfter Stane's death, the original Iron Monger armor was obtained by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]].

He constructs a special [[exoskeleton]] to help him deal with excess heat (and turn into even more usable energy).\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nObadiah Stane was a genius with an M.B.A.. He was a master of psychological warfare, a cunning business strategist, and a champion chess player. However, he had a classic narcissistic complex; his ego was his greatest vulnerability.\n\nAs Iron Monger, Stane also used the Circuits Breaker, a flying robotic weapon that fires air-to-surface missiles. He also used a device created by Dr. Theron Atlanta for exchanging the consciousness of two human subjects.\n\nThe Iron Monger armor, manufactured by Stane International and code-named I-M Mark One, is an armored battle-suit of \"omnium steel\" (a fictional alloy), containing various offensive weaponry including a powered exoskeleton that amplifies the user's strength, repulsor rays fired from the gauntlets, and an intense laser beam housed in the battle-suit's chest unit. The suit provides the user with the ability of subsonic flight, thanks to magnetically powered turbine boot jets. Since the Iron Monger armor was based on a modified version of Tony Stark's Iron Man design, the armor's abilities are very similar to the original red and gold armor, but with increased power. The repulsors are more powerful and the armor is also larger than the armor of Iron Man. It is presumably proportionally stronger as well. The Iron Monger (unlike the Iron Man armor) is also externally computer-controlled. Stane attempted to use the remote control to compensate for his lack of experience in using the armor \u2013 a vulnerability Stark exploited to disable the suit.\n\n==Other versions==\nThe original [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Obadiah Stane is shown as the young son of [[Loni (Ultimate Iron Man)|Loni Stane]] and [[Zebediah Stane]]. During a visit in jail, his mother divorces his father while he gets the other half. The story then fast forwards to Obadiah being enrolled in [[Baxter Building|a special school]] at his mother's personal request. Shortly after their arrival, Obadiah murders a pair of students (Link and Dodge) and made it look like an accident which hardens [[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Tony Stark]]'s resolve to improve his Iron Man armor and punish Obadiah. Later, Obadiah visits [[Howard Stark]] in jail and has the guards attempt to murder him but they failed. Obadiah reveals that he's working with Dolores and Dolores convinced Obadiah to try and murder Howard. Obadiah drugs a prison guard with a \"hypnotizing\" bio-drug, and the guard tries to kill Howard. He fails, but Howard gets shot in the process and is in the ICU and Tony sends [[War Machine|one of his \"robots\"]] to protect his father in the hospital. Tony (in his Iron Man armor) goes to Obadiah's house and confronts him on setting up Howard and sending him to prison for Zebediah's murder. Obadiah says it was all Dolores' idea, and sets up a meeting with Dolores and Tony. Obadiah also figures out that the armor is not a robot, a fact he shares with Dolores before he meets with Tony.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' #1\u20134</ref>\n\nDolores and Tony make a deal. Dolores will give Tony the information about the terrorists with nukes who plan to bomb the city, and Tony will give Dolores one of his \"robots\". Tony, knowing that Dolores knows he wears the armor personally decides to trick him and actually bring an Iron Man suit that is remote controlled. Dolores and Tony meet on a plane together, holding each other hostage while their friends confirm each other's end of the bargain. Dolores is skeptical because the robot is not walking smoothly and is clumsy, and Tony is skeptical because the feds found a nuke but no terrorists with it, and the deal for terrorists. Dolores' men plan to kill the Federal agents who delivered them the robot, but Rhodes shows up to save them.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man 2'' #1</ref>\n\nTony then realizes that Dolores is no longer on the plane, and upon breaking into the cockpit he sees another nuke. He cannot disable it, because then a separate bomb will go off, destroying the nuke and plane. War Machine goes to Dolores' mansion, only to find him dead. Someone booby trapped his piano, and it blew up in his face while he was playing. Tony flies the plane low enough to the water that Obadiah can jump off into the water. He then gets his nanobots to disarm the nuke and set off the smaller bomb while he attempts to jump off the plane. They realize that another arms dealer was out to kill everyone (Dolores, Obadiah and Tony).<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man 2'' #3</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Howard is recovered enough to go to prison, but the guards sent to escort him were not sent by the Police Department. Howard fights them off and escapes. Tony meets with him, and says that he thinks it was Loni that is the mastermind behind the scenes trying to kill them. Tony, [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], Nifara, Howard and Obadiah set off to Utah to find Loni. They arrive and their chopper explodes, injuring Rhodes. Obadiah falls off a cliff, but Iron Man catches him as terrorists arrive on the scene. Iron Man flees, but follows them as they take Obadiah to his mother, Loni, and their hideout. Iron Man breaks into the compound and Loni floods it with poison gas trying to kill him, abandoning Obadiah. After Tony beats Loni and tends to Howard, Obadiah (mad that his mother abandoned him for dead with the poison gas) enters the room and kills her. However, he decides not to attack Tony, stating that he had saved his life several times and that they are now even. They are all picked up by the feds and go home.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' Vol. 2 #4</ref>\n\nIn the retconned Ultimate universe, the mastermind of ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]'' was '''[[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Howard Stark Sr.|Howard Stark Sr.]]''', Tony Stark's grandfather that's in a human/machine armor that resembles the Iron Monger armor with some elements of [[Titanium Man]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars'' #3</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\nObadiah Stane appears in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'', voiced by [[Mackenzie Gray]].<ref>[http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=98 \"New Cast Information On Upcoming \"Iron Man: Armored Adventures\" Series\"] James Harvey, Toon Zone, October 1, 2008</ref> In this continuity, he was Howard Stark's VP at Stark International. After the latter is presumed dead in a plane crash however, Stane inherited the title of CEO as Tony was not old enough at the time. Throughout the series, he is an outspoken critic of Iron Man and wishes to possess his armor for himself. In addition, he supplies criminals with high-powered tech from Howard's vault. Despite his negative traits, he has at times showed compassion, which he directs primarily towards his daughter [[Madam Masque|Whitney]]. In season two, Stane creates the Iron Monger [[mecha|mech]], but loses his position at Stark International after Tony discovers he hired the [[Ghost (comics)|Ghost]] to steal Iron Man's armor specs. Seeking revenge, Stane goes on a rampage until Tony reminds him of his love for Whitney and convinces him to stand down. However, [[Justin Hammer]] hijacks the mech's controls and sends Stane into a coma. Whitney temporarily used the Iron Monger mech to seek revenge against Iron Man in retaliation, but he is able to defeat her.\n\n===Film===\n[[File:Iron_Monger_2008_film.jpg|thumb|Iron Monger as he appears in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'']]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ironmonger 2008film.jpg|thumb|250px|The Iron Monger armor in the film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'']] -->\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] portrays Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger in the 2008 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''.
