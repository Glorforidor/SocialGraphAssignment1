The series ran from November [[2005 in comics|2005]] to October [[2008 in comics|2008]]. The series was written by [[Grant Morrison]], drawn by [[Frank Quitely]], and digitally inked by Jamie Grant. DC claimed that this series would \&quot;strip down the Man of Steel to his timeless, essential elements\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Interview\&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Offenberger |first=Rik |authorlink=Rik Offenberger |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/112602239631900.htm |title=Uniquely Original: Grant Morrison |publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |date=September 6, 2005 |accessdate=April 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125025548/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/112602239631900.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe series was the second to be launched in 2005 under DC&#39;s [[All Star DC Comics|All-Star]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], the first being &#39;&#39;[[All Star Batman &amp; Robin, the Boy Wonder]]&#39;&#39;. These series were attempts by DC to allow major comics creators a chance to tell stories showcasing these characters without being restricted by [[DC Universe]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].\n\n==Publication history==\nGrant Morrison&#39;s approach to writing this series was to make the reading as universal as possible. He stated that he was not interested in \&quot;re-doing origin stories or unpacking classic narratives\&quot; but instead wanted to do \&quot;a total update, rehaul and refit\&quot;. However, rather than just creating a \&quot;fresh and relevant\&quot; update for new readers, Morrison wanted to write a \&quot;collection of \u2018timeless\u2019 Superman issues\&quot;.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; The origins of this lie in a revamp of Superman, &#39;&#39;Superman Now&#39;&#39;, which began when Morrison and editor [[Dan Raspler]] were unsuccessfully brainstorming ideas for a new take on the character outside the [[San Diego Comic Con]], when they had a \&quot;[[shamanic]]\&quot; encounter with a man dressed as Superman which helped spark the creative process and inspired the cover to the first issue. Morrison states in an interview:&lt;ref name=Newsarama&gt;{{cite web |first=Zack |last=Smith |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/100821-All-Star-Morrison-01.html |title=All Star Memories: Grant Morrison on All Star Superman, 1 |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=October 21, 2008 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n{{blockquote|He was perched with one knee drawn up, chin resting on his arms. He looked totally relaxed... and I suddenly realized this was how Superman would sit. He wouldn&#39;t puff out his chest or posture heroically, he would be totally chilled. If nothing can hurt you, you can afford to be cool. A man like Superman would never have to tense against the cold; never have to flinch in the face of a blow. He would be completely laid back, un-tense. With this image of Superman relaxing on a cloud looking out for us all in my head, I rushed back to my hotel room and filled dozens of pages of my notebook with notes and drawings.}}\n\nThe ideas generated by that meeting were refined and pitched to DC in 1998 by Morrison, [[Mark Millar]], [[Mark Waid]] and [[Tom Peyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/02/12/comic-book-legends-revealed-194/ |title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #194 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=February 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They picked up on the fifteen-year cycle of reboots to the character, the previous one being [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]&#39;&#39;, and suggested a new approach:\n\n{{blockquote|The Superman relaunch we\u2019re selling bucks the trend of sweeping aside the work done by those who came immediately before. Unlike the \u2018cosmic reset\u2019 revamps all too prevalent in current comics, our New Superman approach is an honest attempt to synthesize the best of all previous eras. Our intention is to honor each of Superman\u2019s various interpretations and to use internal story logic as our launching pad for a re-imagined, streamlined 21st century Man of Steel. The \u2018cosmic reset\u2019 notion has been replaced by a policy of \u2018include and transcend\u2019 with regard to past continuity.\n\nOur intention is to restore Superman to his pre-eminent place as the greatest super-hero of all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theages.superman.nu/History/2000/ |title=Superman 2000 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Superman.nu |publisher= |access-date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302182826/http://theages.superman.nu/History/2000/|archivedate=2 March 2010 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\nAlthough initially greenlit, it was eventually turned down and Morrison said that \&quot;he didn\u2019t expect to be doing any further work on Superman\&quot; but the chance came as he was finishing his run on &#39;&#39;[[New X-Men (2001 series)|New X-Men]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=Newsarama/&gt; In an interview with Matt Brady from [[Newsarama]], Grant Morrison said that he was contacted by DC Vice President [[Dan DiDio]] and asked \&quot;if I&#39;d like to come back to DC to work on a Superman project with an artist of my choice\&quot;. He mentioned it worked out well since he was also planning to return to DC \&quot;to do the &#39;&#39;[[Seven Soldiers]]&#39;&#39; project and the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] books\&quot;.\n\nMorrison has confirmed that he made use of some of his &#39;&#39;Superman Now&#39;&#39; ideas for &#39;&#39;All-Star Superman&#39;&#39;, like \&quot;Luthor\u2019s heart-stopping moment of understanding\&quot;, as well as drawing on his original proposal for elements later included in the \&quot;[[DC One Million]]\&quot; storyline.&lt;ref name=Newsarama/&gt;\n\nIn his writing of the character Superman, Morrison identifies different aspects of his personality, stating: \&quot;&#39;Superman&#39; is an act. &#39;Clark Kent&#39; in Metropolis is also an act. There are actually two Kents, at least \u2013 one is a disguise, a bumbling, awkward mask for Superman. The other is the confident, strong, good-hearted Clark Kent who was raised by his surrogate Ma and Pa in Kansas and knows how to drive a tractor. I think he&#39;s the most &#39;real&#39; of all\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brady |first=Matt | url=http://classic.newsarama.com/DC/AS/AllStarSuperman_Morrison.htm |title=Grant Morrison: Talking All-Star Superman |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=December 22, 2004 |accessdate=April 21, 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs the series drew to a close, writer Grant Morrison conceived of a series of one-shot specials, loose in continuity from the original series, that would depict or pay tribute to the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Superman, the [[Super-Sons]] &#39;&#39;[[World&#39;s Finest Comics]]&#39;&#39; team, the Superman Squad, the [[Superman (Kal Kent)|Superman of the 853rd Century]], and the [[Superman dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeffrey |last=Renaud |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=16045 |title=ALL STAR MORRISON III: Superman |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Publisher [[Dan DiDio]] has stated that there are no current plans for the specials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091012-10-answers-dan-didio.html |title=10 Answers &amp; a Question with Dan Didio 10-12-09 Updated |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison would later become involved as writer on a [[Action Comics#The New 52|2011 relaunch of &#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39;]] where he used his ideas about the Golden Age Superman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/review-action-comics-the-grant-morrison-edition/ |title=Review: Action Comics, the Grant Morrison Edition |last1=Sneddon |first1=Laura |last2= |first2= |date=March 26, 2013 |website=Comics Beat |publisher= |accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Leo Quintum and his team from [[Project Cadmus|P.R.O.J.E.C.T.]] are exploring the [[Sun]] when they are remotely sabotaged by [[Lex Luthor]]. [[Superman]] rescues them, and acquires the ability to project his bio-electric aura. Luthor orchestrated this event to overwhelm Superman&#39;s cells with massive amounts of solar radiation; Quintum determines that Superman&#39;s new level of power is also killing him, and that he has one year left to live. Luthor is arrested, thanks to a [[Daily Planet]] article by [[Clark Kent]]. Superman decides to keep his impending death secret from the public.\n\n[[File:AllStarSuperman10.jpg|thumb|left|Superman on the cover of &#39;&#39;All-Star Superman&#39;&#39; #10 (May 2008); artwork by [[Frank Quitely]]]]\nHowever, Superman reveals his secret identity to [[Lois Lane]], because he wants to spend his remaining time with her. Lois initially refuses to believe that Clark and Superman are the same person. For her birthday, Superman takes Lois to the [[Fortress of Solitude]], where they have dinner in a stateroom of the [[RMS Titanic]], which Superman has raised and restored. During this visit, he also tells Lois that she can explore the Fortress save for one room he is constantly checking. Superman&#39;s furtive behavior heightens Lois&#39; suspicions and she becomes paranoid. She attacks Superman with a Kryptonite laser, but his enhanced powers have rendered him immune to it.\n\nSuperman calms her down and reveals that he was preparing her birthday present in the off-limits room: a liquefied form of his DNA that will grant her all his superpowers for 24 hours, as well as a leotard for her costume. Using the name \&quot;[[Superwoman]]\&quot;, she joins Superman as he stops a monster attack in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] involving Samson, [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]] and an Ultra-Sphinx. Superman drives Samson and Altas away and he and Lois spend an eventful day that ends with them kissing on the moon before her powers fade and she falls asleep. Superman flies her back home.\n\nLuthor is convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death. Clark meets with Luthor for an interview at [[Stryker&#39;s Island]]. Luthor discloses his respect for Clark as a journalist and states that he has no desire to escape as long as he defeats Superman by causing his death. He reveals to Clark that Superman is dying, hoping that it will be published in the Daily Planet.\n\nNearing death, Superman accomplishes a variety of tasks that significantly help both humans and Kryptonians, and completes his last will and testament. Meanwhile, Luthor survives his execution as he took a serum similar to what Superman made for Lois and escapes. Superman then learns of Luthor&#39;s ally [[Solaris (comics)|Solaris]], who has tampered with the sun. Superman engages Solaris until a Sun-Eater that Superman had cared for in the Fortress and subsequently released returns to weaken it. After Solaris destroys the Sun-Eater, Superman defeats Solaris, leaving its body intact because he has learned from the Superman Squad that Solaris will become an ally in the future. Clark returns to the Daily Planet to submit his article but falls dead. As the staff tries to save him, Luthor arrives and attacks Metropolis.\n\nBelieving he is on his home planet of Krypton, Superman joins his Kryptonian father [[Jor-El]], who reveals that Superman&#39;s body is converting itself to a solar radio-consciousness. He offers him a choice; remain or come back to life. Clark wakes up, and confronts Luthor, firing a gravity gun at him. The gravity gun warps time for Luthor, speeding up the exhaustion of his powers. As his powers fade, Luthor briefly sees the world as Superman sees it, and weeps before Superman knocks him out. Superman and Lois embrace and he proclaims his love for her once and for all. He takes off, flies into the Sun and repairs it, saving the day for one last time. One year later, Lois tells Jimmy that she still believes Superman will return. Inside the sun, Superman, now a solar being, maintains machinery to keep the sun alive. The story concludes with Quintum revealing that if something happens, they will be ready, standing before a door with Superman&#39;s characteristic shield, but with its usual \&quot;S\&quot; replaced with the number \&quot;2\&quot;.\n\nKal-El himself would one day emerge from his seclusion: he was seen once from countless thousands of years in the future, having evolved into a sort of [[DC One Million|golden god]], meeting with his past self shortly after the death of Jonathan Kent and his masquerade as the Unknown Superman, and shortly before his own \&quot;death\&quot;. The future Superman presented his dying past self with an indestructible golden flower from New Krypton, \&quot;For him, from all of us. In remembrance of all that we are. And all that we will be\&quot;. The flower was planted at Jonathan Kent&#39;s grave.\n\n==Reception==\nThe first issue was released in November 2005 and was a sales success, ranking second in the top 300 comics for that period, with &#39;&#39;Infinite Crisis&#39;&#39; #2 being the top seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=December 19, 2005 | url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/7956.html | title=Top 300 Comics Actual \u2013 November 2005 | publisher=ICv2.com | accessdate=April 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second issue also ranked second in the top 300 comics for the January 2006 period, with pre-order sales of 124,328; &#39;&#39;Infinite Crisis&#39;&#39; #4 being the top seller that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/8247.html | title=Top 300 Comics Actual \u2013 January 2006 | publisher=ICv2.com | accessdate=April 24, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080430211705/http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/8247.html| archivedate= 30 April 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series completed its run upon publication of its final issue in October 2008.\n\nJeremy Estes, an early reviewer from [[PopMatters]], notes the difficulty in revamping the character Superman in his review of the first issue of the series. However, the &#39;&#39;All-Star&#39;&#39; continuity allowed the writer Grant Morrison much more writing freedom. Frank Quitely&#39;s art is praised as \&quot;fresh and modern\&quot;, while still \&quot;evoking the classic hero known around the world\&quot;.
