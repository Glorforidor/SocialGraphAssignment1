                <span class="s2">&quot;extract&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Batman Forever is a 1995 American superhero film directed by Joel Schumacher and produced by Tim Burton, based on the DC Comics character Batman. A stand-alone sequel to the 1992 film Batman Returns and the third installment of Warner Bros.&#39; initial Batman film series, it stars Val Kilmer replacing Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne and Batman, alongside Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman, Chris O&#39;Donnell, Michael Gough, and Pat Hingle. The plot focuses on Batman trying to stop Two-Face and the Riddler in their villainous scheme to extract confidential information from all the minds in Gotham City and use it to learn Batman&#39;s identity and bring the city under their control. In the process, he gains allegiance from a young, orphaned circus acrobat named Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick Robin, and meets and develops feelings for psychologist Dr. Chase Meridian, which brings him to the point to decide if he will lead a normal life or if he is destined to fight crime as Batman forever.\nSchumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton&#39;s films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic books of the Dick Sprang era, as well as the 1960s television series. After Keaton chose not to reprise his role, William Baldwin and Ethan Hawke were considered as a replacement before Val Kilmer joined the cast.\nThe film was released on June 16, 1995. Batman Forever grossed over $336 million worldwide and became the sixth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1995. The film received mixed reviews, with criticism directed towards the CGI, Kilmer&#39;s performance, costume designs and tonal departure from previous films, but praising the visuals and performances of Carrey and Jones. The film was followed by Batman &amp; Robin in 1997, with Schumacher returning as the director, Chris O&#39;Donnell returning as Robin, and George Clooney replacing Kilmer as Batman.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Gotham City, the vigilante Batman defuses a hostage situation orchestrated by a criminal known as Two-Face\u2014formerly district attorney Harvey Dent, who was disfigured with acid by mobster Sal Maroni, which Batman failed to prevent\u2014but Two-Face escapes. Edward Nygma, an eccentric researcher at Wayne Enterprises, approaches his employer, Bruce Wayne\u2014secretly Batman\u2014with an invention that can beam television signals into a person&#39;s brain. Bruce rejects the device, concerned the technology could manipulate minds. After killing his supervisor and staging the death as a suicide, Nygma resigns and plots revenge against Bruce, obsessively sending him riddles.\nBruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychologist obsessed with Batman, and invites her to the circus. Two-Face hijacks the event and threatens to detonate a bomb unless Batman surrenders himself. Acrobat Dick Grayson, the youngest member of the Flying Graysons, manages to throw the bomb into the river, but Two-Face kills his family. Bruce persuades the orphaned Dick to live at Wayne Manor as his ward, and Dick discovers Bruce is Batman. Taking the Batmobile for a joyride, Batman saves Dick from thugs; determined to avenge his family, Dick demands to join Batman in crime-fighting and kill Two-Face, but Bruce refuses.\nNygma, inspired by Two-Face&#39;s raid at the circus, adopts a criminal persona, the Riddler, and forms an alliance with Two-Face, promising to uncover Batman&#39;s identity. They commit a series of robberies to finance Nygma&#39;s new company and mass-produce his brainwave device, the \u201cBox\u201d, which secretly steals information from users\u2019 minds. Nygma hosts a party where he goads Bruce into using the Box, before Two-Face unexpectedly arrives. As Batman, Bruce pursues Two-Face and is nearly killed, but is rescued by Dick.\nBatman visits Chase, who explains that she has fallen in love with Bruce. He invites her to the manor and reveals his secret identity, while Dick runs away after taking parts from one of Bruce&#39;s Batsuits. The Riddler and Two-Face, having discovered Bruce&#39;s secret through the Box, arrive and blow up the Batcave, shooting Bruce and kidnapping Chase. As Bruce recovers, he and his butler, Alfred, use the riddles to deduce that Nygma is the Riddler. Bruce dons a new Batsuit and Dick joins him as Batman&#39;s partner, Robin.\nBatman and Robin reach Riddler and Two-Face&#39;s lair on Claw Island, where they are separated. Robin encounters Two-Face and nearly kills him, but spares his life and is captured. Batman confronts the Riddler, who reveals Chase and Robin trapped in containment tubes above a deadly drop, giving Batman the chance to save only one hostage. Instead, Batman destroys the Riddler&#39;s brainwave receiver with a Batarang, overwhelming the Riddler&#39;s mind and allowing Batman to rescue Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with the flip of a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death.\nImprisoned in Arkham Asylum, the Riddler claims to know Batman&#39;s secret identity and is visited by Chase, but it is revealed that the delusional Nygma now believes he is Batman. Chase tells Bruce that his secret is safe before parting ways, and Bruce resumes his crusade as Batman with Robin as his partner.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nVal Kilmer as Bruce Wayne / Batman: After coming across the journal of his father, Wayne starts questioning his act of vengeance. He struggles with his dual identity as a crime fighter, becoming romantically involved with Dr. Chase Meridian.\nTommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent / Two-Face: Formerly the good district attorney of Gotham City.

After Batman Returns was deemed too dark and inappropriate for children, with McDonald&#39;s even shutting down their Happy Meal tie-in, Warner Bros. decided that this was the primary cause of the film&#39;s financial results and asked Burton to step down in favor of another director; Sam Raimi and John McTiernan were considered, Joel Schumacher was selected by Burton. Husband-and-wife screenwriting couple Lee and Janet Scott-Batchler were brought on to write the script, and agreed with Burton that \&quot;the key element to Batman is his duality. And it&#39;s not just that Batman is Bruce Wayne\&quot;. Their original script introduced a psychotic Riddler with a pet rat accompanying him. The story elements and much of the dialogue still remained in the finished film, though Schumacher felt it could be \&quot;lighte[ne]d down\&quot;. Keaton initially approved the selection of Schumacher as director and planned on reprising his role as Batman from the first two films. Schumacher claims he originally had in mind an adaptation of Frank Miller&#39;s Batman: Year One and Keaton claimed that he was enthusiastic about the idea. Warner Bros. rejected the idea as they wanted a sequel, not a prequel, though Schumacher was able to include very brief events in Bruce Wayne&#39;s childhood with some events of the comic The Dark Knight Returns. Akiva Goldsman, who worked with Schumacher on The Client, was brought in to rewrite the script, deleting the initial idea of bringing in the Scarecrow as a villain with Riddler, and the return of Catwoman. Burton, who now was more interested in directing Ed Wood, later reflected he was taken aback by some of the focus group meetings for Batman Forever, a title he hated. Producer Peter MacGregor-Scott represented the studio&#39;s aim in making a film for the MTV Generation with full merchandising appeal.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nProduction went on fast track with Rene Russo cast as Chase Meridian but Keaton decided not to reprise Batman because he did not like the direction the series was headed in and rejected the script. Keaton also wanted to pursue \&quot;more interesting roles\&quot;, turning down $15 million. A decision was made to go with a younger actor for Bruce Wayne, and an offer was made to Ethan Hawke, who turned it down but eventually regretted the decision. Schumacher had seen Val Kilmer in Tombstone, but was also interested in Keanu Reeves, Alec and William Baldwin, Dean Cain, Tom Hanks, Kurt Russell, Daniel Day-Lewis, Ralph Fiennes, Johnny Depp and Mel Gibson. Cain was scrapped as he was well known for starring in the TV series Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Kilmer, who as a child visited the studios where the 1960s series was recorded and shortly before had visited a bat cave in Africa, was contacted by his agent for the role. Kilmer signed on without reading the script or knowing who the director was.With Kilmer&#39;s casting, Warner Bros. dropped Russo, considering her too old to be paired with Kilmer. Sandra Bullock, Robin Wright, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Linda Hamilton were all considered for the role, which was eventually recast with Nicole Kidman. Billy Dee Williams took the role of Harvey Dent in Batman on the possibility of portraying Two-Face in a sequel, but Schumacher cast Tommy Lee Jones in the role, although Al Pacino, Clint Eastwood, Martin Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Nicolas Cage and Robert De Niro were considered, after working with him on The Client. Jones was reluctant to accept the role, but did so at his son&#39;s insistence. Robin Williams was in discussions to be the Riddler at one point but eventually turned down the role, resentful he was used in 1989 as bait for Jack Nicholson to play Joker, and also because of his contractual issues with Jumanji. In a 2003 interview, Schumacher said Michael Jackson lobbied hard for the role, but was turned down before Jim Carrey was cast. Other actors considered were John Malkovich, Brad Dourif (considered before by Burton to portray Scarecrow), Kelsey Grammer, Micky Dolenz, Matthew Broderick, Phil Hartman, Steve Martin, Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider. Mark Hamill was going to get the role, but had to turn it down due to contract issues. Robin appeared in the shooting script for Batman Returns but was deleted due to the use of too many characters. Marlon Wayans had been cast in the role, and signed for a potential sequel, but when Schumacher took over, he decided to open up casting to other actors. Leonardo DiCaprio was considered, but decided not to pursue the role after a meeting with Schumacher. Matt Damon, Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, Mark Wahlberg, Michael Worth, Toby Stephens, Ewan McGregor, Jude Law, Alan Cumming, Christian Bale (who starred as Batman/Bruce Wayne in The Dark Knight trilogy), and Scott Speedman were considered also. Chris O&#39;Donnell was cast and Mitch Gaylord served as his stunt double, and also portrayed Mitch Grayson, Dick&#39;s older brother, created for the film. Schumacher attempted to create a cameo role for Bono as his MacPhisto character, but both came to agree it was not suitable for the film.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming started in September 1994. Schumacher hired Barbara Ling for production design, claiming that the film needed a \&quot;force\&quot; and good design. Ling could \&quot;advance on it\&quot;. Schumacher wanted a design in no way connected to the previous films, and instead inspired by the images from the Batman comic books seen in the 1940s/early 1950s and New York City architecture in the 1930s, with a combination of modern Tokyo. He also wanted a \&quot;city with personality,\&quot; with more statues, as well as various amounts of neon.\nSchumacher had problems with Kilmer, whom he described as \&quot;childish and impossible,\&quot; reporting that he fought with various crewmen, and refused to speak to Schumacher for two weeks after the director told him to stop being rude. Schumacher also mentioned Tommy Lee Jones as a source of trouble: \&quot;Jim Carrey was a gentleman, and Tommy Lee was threatened by him. I&#39;m tired of defending overpaid, overprivileged actors. I pray I don&#39;t work with them again.\&quot; Carrey later acknowledged Jones was not friendly to him, telling him once off-set during the production, \&quot;I hate you. I really don&#39;t like you ... I cannot sanction your buffoonery.\&quot;\n\n\n=== Design and effects ===\nRick Baker designed the prosthetic makeup. John Dykstra, Andrew Adamson, and Jim Rygiel served as visual effects supervisors, with Pacific Data Images also contributing to visual effects work. PDI provided a computer-generated Batman for complicated stunts. For the costume design, producer Peter MacGregor-Scott claimed that 146 workers were at one point working together. Batman&#39;s costume was redesigned along the lines of a more \&quot;MTV organic, and edgier feel\&quot; to the suit. Sound editing and mixing was supervised by Bruce Stambler and John Levesque, which included trips to caves to record bat sounds. A new Batmobile was designed for Batman Forever, with two cars being constructed, one for stunt purposes and one for close-ups. Swiss surrealist painter H. R. Giger provided his version for the Batmobile but it was considered too sinister for the film.\n\n\n=== Deleted scenes ===\nBatman Forever went through a few major edits before its release. Originally darker than the final product, the film&#39;s original length was closer to 2 hours and 40 minutes, according to Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the film&#39;s 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous Batman films were given special-edition DVD releases on the same day as the Batman Begins DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, although some of the following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.There was an undercurrent theme involving Bruce having repressed memories of an aspect of his parents&#39; death that he hadn&#39;t faced. His memories involved finding his father&#39;s diary on the night of his parents&#39; wake and reading that Bruce insisted that his parents must go to the theater, so he could watch one of the shows\u2014meaning he became Batman out of guilt that he was responsible for their deaths.\nMany scenes were filmed but deleted; others had footage removed. These included:\n\nThe escape of Two-Face from Arkham Asylum. Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois had another scene filmed here in the role of Doctor Burton, but his role was reduced in the final film. He discovers Two-Face&#39;s escape, encountering his psychologist hanged in Two-Face&#39;s cell with \&quot;The Bat Must Die\&quot; written in blood on the wall. This was supposed to be the film&#39;s opening scene, but producers decided this was far too dark for a family audience. This scene appears in the comic adaptation and the novelization. Segments of the scene also appears on the U2 music video of \&quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me.\&quot;\nWhen Two-Face addresses the crowd from the helicopter in the opening action scene, the speech was truncated and several lines that appeared in the Theatrical Trailer were removed, including the line \&quot;If the Bat wants to play, we&#39;ll play!\&quot;\nIn the bank heist at the beginning of the film, after Two-Face&#39;s men shoots the elevator, Batman appeared and asks the men and Two-Face, \&quot;Going Down?\&quot; His line was cut and only appeared in the film&#39;s trailer.\nThere was a sequence that contained an extended fight scene between Two-Face and Batman, where they struggle for control of the helicopter. Two-Face accuses Batman of being \&quot;a killer too\&quot; (a continuity reference to the previous Burton films), then manages to escape by parachute after Batman realizes he has locked the steering wheel into position. This sequence is included in rough form on the special-edition DVD.\nA scene right before Nygma arrives at Wayne Manor. It featured Bruce Wayne watching a local Gotham talk show with Chase Meridian as a guest, talking about Batman.\nOne scene right before Riddler and Two-face team up featured a little conversation with Dick and Bruce in the gym of the manor. This would explain why Dick suddenly has martial arts training. This scene appears in a rough edit on the special-edition DVD.\nThe scene where the Riddler fails to punch a security guard out. The guard is then brutally beaten by the Riddler using his cane. In the theatrical trailer, this guard is punched by Two-Face.\nOne sequence came directly after the casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He shows up at the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), where a roomful of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile&#39;s tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the special-edition DVD.\nThe construction of NygmaTech was after Batman solves the third riddle and was more in-depth. There were scenes shot that appear in publicity stills of Nygma with a hard hat helping with the construction of his headquarters on Claw Island.\nSugar and Spice, played by Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar, try out the Riddler&#39;s device during the montage when it goes on sale. They are seated with the Riddler and Two-Face on the couch where Chase is handcuffed later in the film. This scene appears in the comic book adaptation, but not in the final film.\nThere was originally a scene after the montage of Alfred and Bruce examining the NygmaTech \&quot;Box.\&quot;\nAn extended scene established Bruce in the Batcave shortly after having discussed with Dick then that this would have saved his life after the battle with Two-Face in the subway system under construction. In this scene he is appreciated as the GNN news (Bruce watching in the Batcomputer) attacking Batman and Two-Face after the battle in the Subway and after that Bruce talking to Alfred turns into the dilemma of continuing to be Batman and try a normal life with Chase. Like the deleted Helicopter fight sequence, this scene also makes reference to Batman being \&quot;a killer\&quot;, and in the original production screenplay, this scene was to contain footage from Batman Returns, specifically the rooftop fight scene with Catwoman. This explains why in the theatrical version Bruce turns off all the systems in the Batcave telling Dick he gives up being Batman. This scene appears in a rough form on the special-edition DVD.\nAnother scene in the Wayne Manor raid sequence was longer, featuring Bruce and Chase fighting Two-Face and his thugs.\nThe scene involving Chase Meridian on the couch originally included a longer ending where the Riddler injects her with a green sleeping agent so he can easily place her in the small tube with the trap door.\nAnother deleted scene involved Bruce waking up after being shot in the head by Two-Face, temporarily forgetting his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the Batmobile was, and Alfred says, \&quot;Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave.\&quot; The platform then rotates downward to another level where the sonar-modification equipment is kept, from the special Batsuit to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the giant bat that inspired him to become Batman. Inside he finds his father&#39;s red diary which he had dropped when he first fell into the Batcave after his parents death. He reads the entry about him insisting his parents take him to the theater to see a show the same night they were killed. He realizes he had misread it, and his father had written &#39;even though Bruce insists, we wanted to see Zorro so his show will have to wait until next week&#39;. Bruce realizes his parents death was not his fault after all. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms to match the wing anatomy of the bat and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman admitted the scene was very theatrical on the special-edition DVD and felt it would have made a difference to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by Rick Baker, who was in charge of the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special-edition DVD.\nThe fight scene between Two-Face and Robin on Claw Island was originally longer.\nThe original ending was similar in style to the previous Batman films, which had involved a scene with Alfred in the limousine, the camera tracking upward through the Gotham cityscape, followed by a rooftop shot involving a silhouetted hero (Batman in the original, Catwoman in Batman Returns) facing the Bat Signal. When Alfred drives Doctor Chase Meridian back to Gotham, she asks him: \&quot;Does it ever end, Alfred?\&quot; Alfred replies: \&quot;No, Doctor Meridian, not in this lifetime...\&quot; The Bat-Signal shines on the night sky and Batman is standing on a pillar looking ahead. Robin then comes into shot and joins his new partner. They both leap off the pillar, towards the camera. A rough edit of the first half of the scene appears on the special-edition DVD, but not in its entirety.\n\n\n=== Schumacher Cut ===\nAfter Joel Schumacher died in June 2020, media outlets starting reporting the possible existence of a \&quot;Schumacher Cut\&quot;, with the first rumors being thrown in by American journalist Marc Bernardin. This version was believed to be darker and contain less camp than the theatrical cut. Some of the differences include Bruce facing off against a human-sized bat, the darker, more serious tone, less of an emphasis on Dick Grayson, and a focus on Bruce&#39;s psychological issues with Chase. In total, the cut uses about 40 minutes of footage. Warner Bros. confirmed the cut exists after an interview with Variety, although they have no plans to release it and are unsure about whether what, if any, footage remains. Some of the aforementioned deleted scenes make up a portion of this footage. \n\n\n== Music ==\n\nElliot Goldenthal was hired by Schumacher to compose the film score before the screenplay was written. In discussions with Schumacher, the director wanted Goldenthal to avoid taking inspiration from Danny Elfman, and requested an original composition. The film&#39;s promotional teaser trailer used the main title theme from Elfman&#39;s score of 1989&#39;s Batman.The soundtrack was commercially successful, selling almost as many copies as Prince&#39;s soundtrack to the 1989 Batman film. Only five of the songs on the soundtrack are actually featured in the movie. Hit singles from the soundtrack include \&quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\&quot; by U2 and \&quot;Kiss from a Rose\&quot; by Seal, both of which were nominated for MTV Movie Awards. \&quot;Kiss from a Rose\&quot; (whose video was also directed by Joel Schumacher) reached No. 1 in the U.S. charts as well. The soundtrack itself, featuring additional songs by The Flaming Lips, Brandy (both songs also included in the film), Method Man, Nick Cave, Michael Hutchence (of INXS), PJ Harvey, and Massive Attack, was an attempt to (in producer Peter MacGregor-Scott&#39;s words) make the film more \&quot;pop\&quot;.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nBatman Forever opened in 2,842 theaters in the United States on June 16, 1995, making $52.8 million in its opening weekend, breaking Jurassic Park&#39;s record for highest opening-weekend gross of all time (it was surpassed two years later by The Lost World: Jurassic Park&#39;s $72.1 million). The film went on to gross $184 million in North America, and $152.5 million in other countries, totaling $336.53 million. The film earned more money than its predecessor Batman Returns, and is the highest-grossing film from 1995.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 39% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site&#39;s critical consensus reads, \&quot;Loud, excessively busy, and often boring, Batman Forever nonetheless has the charisma of Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones to offer mild relief.\&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \&quot;mixed or average reviews\&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \&quot;A\u2013\&quot; on an A+ to F scale.Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said \&quot;Batman Forever still gets in its licks. There&#39;s no fun machine this summer that packs more surprises.\&quot; Travers criticized the film&#39;s excessive commercialism and felt that \&quot;the script misses the pain Tim Burton caught in a man tormented by the long-ago murder of his parents\&quot; seeing the Bruce Wayne of Kilmer as \&quot;inexpressive\&quot;. James Berardinelli of ReelViews enjoyed the film. \&quot;It&#39;s lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, and a whole lot more colorful than before.\&quot; Scott Beatty felt \&quot;Tommy Lee Jones played Harvey Dent as a Joker knock-off rather than a multi-layered rogue.\&quot; Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times both gave the film mixed reviews, but with the former giving it a thumbs up and the latter a thumbs down. In his written review, Ebert wrote: \&quot;Is the movie better entertainment? Well, it&#39;s great bubblegum for the eyes. Younger children will be able to process it more easily; some kids were led bawling from Batman Returns where the PG-13 rating was a joke.\&quot; Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle had a mixed reaction, concluding \&quot;a shot of Kilmer&#39;s rubber buns at one point is guaranteed to bring squeals from the audience.\&quot; Brian Lowry of Variety believed \&quot;One does have to question the logic behind adding nipples to the hard-rubber batsuit. Whose idea was that supposed to be anyway, Alfred&#39;s? Some of the computer-generated Gotham cityscapes appear too obviously fake. Elliot Goldenthal&#39;s score, while serviceable, also isn&#39;t as stirring as Danny Elfman&#39;s work in the first two films.\&quot;Some observers thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline. Regarding the costume design, Schumacher stated, \&quot;I had no idea that putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from Ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct.\&quot; O&#39;Donnell felt \&quot;it wasn&#39;t so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn&#39;t think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual.\&quot;\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nAt the 68th Academy Awards, Batman Forever was nominated for Cinematography (lost to Braveheart), Sound (Donald O. Mitchell, Frank A. Monta\u00f1o, Michael Herbick and Petur Hliddal; lost to Apollo 13) and Sound Effects Editing (John Leveque and Bruce Stambler) (also lost to Braveheart). \&quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\&quot; by U2 was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song (lost to \&quot;Colors of the Wind\&quot; from Pocahontas), but was also nominated for the Worst Original Song Golden Raspberry Award (lost to \&quot;Walk Into the Wind\&quot; from Showgirls).

However, it won in just one category\u2014Best Song from a Movie for Seal&#39;s \&quot;Kiss from a Rose\&quot;.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nBatman Forever was released on DVD on February 10, 2009; on Blu-ray on April 20, 2010; and on Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 4, 2019.\n\n\n== Other media and merchandising ==\nIn addition to a large line of toys, video games and action figures from Kenner, the McDonald&#39;s food chain released several collectibles and mugs to coincide with the release of the film.
