He fights against Hawkman for many years, as well as the Justice League of America. He is also a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains.Matter Master later resurfaces in St. Roch, kidnapping the richest people in order to draw Hawkman into a confrontation. The battle lasts only a few seconds, ending when Hawkman uses his axe to sever Matter Master's right arm. Mandrill later returns in league with a team of other villains who had been victims of mind-wipes by the JLA.
