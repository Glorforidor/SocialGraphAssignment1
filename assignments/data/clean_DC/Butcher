It was followed by two mini-series in 1991 and 1999, and was revived as an ongoing title in 2007. The focus of the series has varied over time, but it most commonly features team-ups of characters from across the DC Universe.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\n\n\n=== Volume 1 ===\nThe first volume of the series ran for 200 issues from August/September 1955 to July 1983. Originally, The Brave and the Bold was an anthology series featuring adventure tales from past ages with characters such as the Silent Knight, the Viking Prince, the Golden Gladiator, and Robin Hood. With issue #25, the series was reinvented as a try-out title for new characters and concepts, starting with the Suicide Squad created by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Ross Andru. Gardner Fox and Joe Kubert created a new version of Hawkman in issue #34 (February\u2013March 1961) with the character receiving his own title three years later.Editor Julius Schwartz hired Gardner Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky to create the Justice League of America.  The team debuted in The Brave and the Bold #28 (February\u2013March 1960), and after two further appearances in the title, received its own series.Issues #45 through #49 (Dec. 1962/Jan. 1963 through Aug./Sept. 1963) were devoted to \&quot;Strange Sports Stories,\&quot; combining sport and science-fiction in tales such as \&quot;Challenge of the Headless Baseball Team\&quot; and \&quot;The Man Who Drove Through Time.\&quot; (Ten year later, in 1973, Strange Sports Stories was resurrected as a DC Comics title in its own right, but it lasted only six issues.)The series was changed yet again with issue #50 as a team-up title between established characters. Starting with issue #59 The Brave and the Bold became, more specifically, a Batman team-up book with the Caped Crusader as the book&#39;s main focus. This was due to the popularity of the Batman television series. After issue #74, The Brave and the Bold was exclusively a Batman team-up title until it ended with issue #200.\nThe teaming of Robin, Kid Flash, and Aqualad in issue #54 (June\u2013July 1964) by writer Bob Haney and artist Bruno Premiani led to the creation of the Teen Titans. The three heroes subsequently appeared under the name \&quot;Teen Titans\&quot; in issue #60 (June\u2013July 1965) by Haney and artist Nick Cardy and were joined by Wonder Woman&#39;s younger sister Wonder Girl in her first appearance.The Metamorpho character was created by Haney and artist Ramona Fradon in The Brave and the Bold #57 (December 1964\u2013January 1965).The title was the first to feature Neal Adams&#39; version of Batman,  generating fan interest that led to Adams&#39; style defining the modern Batman image to this day. In addition, Adams updated Green Arrow&#39;s visual appearance by designing a new costume for the character in issue #85 (August\u2013September 1969). The primary artist for the second half of the run was Jim Aparo, starting with #98 (October\u2013November 1971). Haney frequently disregarded continuity by scripting stories which contradicted DC&#39;s canon or by writing major heroes in an out-of-character fashion. Issue #100 (Feb.\u2013March 1972) featured Batman and \&quot;4 Famous Co-Stars\&quot; (Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Black Canary, and Robin) in a story by Haney and Aparo. Issues #112 (April\u2013May 1974) to #117 (Feb.\u2013March 1975) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format.The character Nemesis, also known as Thomas Tresser, debuted in an eight-page backup story in issue #166 (September 1980) written by Cary Burkett and drawn by Dan Spiegle. The Tresser character was created by Burkett in 1979, and named for an actor with whom Burkett was rooming in New Hampshire.Alan Brennert wrote four issues of The Brave and the Bold featuring Batman teaming with the Creeper, Hawk and Dove, the Robin of Earth-Two, and the Catwoman.The title&#39;s final issue featured a team-up of the Batmen of Earth-One and Earth-Two and included a preview of Batman and the Outsiders, the title that replaced The Brave and the Bold on DC&#39;s schedule and became Aparo&#39;s next regular assignment.\n\n\n=== Full list of issues ===\n\n\n=== Volume 2 ===\nIn December 1991\u2013June 1992, The Brave and the Bold returned as a six-issue miniseries featuring Green Arrow, the Question, and the Butcher. The miniseries was written by Mike Grell and Mike Baron.\n\n\n=== Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold ===\nA six-issue miniseries was published from October 1999\u2013March 2000 starring the Flash and Green Lantern titled Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold. This miniseries was written by Mark Waid and Tom Peyer with art by Barry Kitson and Tom Grindberg. A trade paperback of this mini-series was published in 2001 (ISBN 1-56389-708-3).\nThe title was used again in 2001 for The Brave and the Bold Annual #1 (1969), a one-shot special that reprinted selected Silver Age team-ups. The book was designed in the 1960s-style \&quot;80-Page Giant\&quot; format as if it were an actual annual issue of the original run of the title, which did not have an annual in 1969.\n\n\n=== Volume 3 ===\nDC resurrected the Brave and the Bold title as another ongoing series in April 2007. Deciding that it would be a random team-up series, and not a Batman team-up series, the first writer was Mark Waid, who remained on the title for its first 16 issues. The first arc, \&quot;The Lords of Luck\&quot;, involved Batman in a team-up with Green Lantern Hal Jordan. The story depicted the characters joining forces with various other characters in tracking down the book of Destiny, with appearances by Supergirl, Lobo, Blue Beetle, the Legion of Super Heroes, Adam Strange, and the Challengers of the Unknown. The second arc picked up threads from the first, but mainly focused on self-contained stories.\nAfter Waid&#39;s departure, Marv Wolfman took over for a two-part storyline, involving Supergirl and Raven battling the son of Triumph, while David Hine and Doug Braithwaite did a four-issue arc on the series featuring Hal Jordan and the Phantom Stranger. Following this, Dan Jurgens wrote issue #23, featuring Booster Gold and Magog. Like Wolfman&#39;s run, this era was prominent for its team-ups between DC heroes and the characters of Milestone Media. Writer Matt Wayne and artist Howard Porter collaborated on a team-up between Static and Black Lightning, and Adam Beechen and Roger Robinson wrote another featuring Hardware and Blue Beetle. The final Milestone issue was a team-up between Xombi and the Spectre, by John Rozum and Scott Hampton.\nIn September 2009, the title was taken over by J. Michael Straczynski and artist Jesus Saiz with issue #27, which featured a team-up between Batman and Dial H For Hero. Similar to the Milestone issues, it was intended for Straczynski&#39;s run on the series to showcase the Red Circle Comics characters licensed from Archie Comics. This idea was ultimately scrapped. Following the first issue, Straczynski wrote team-ups between: Barry Allen and Blackhawk; the Joker and the Atom; Hal Jordan and Doctor Fate; Batman and Brother Power; Aquaman and Etrigan; and Barbara Gordon, Wonder Woman, and Zatanna, which served as a companion piece to Alan Moore&#39;s Batman: The Killing Joke graphic novel.\n\n\n=== Batman and Wonder Woman ===\nIn 2018, DC released a limited series starring Batman and Wonder Woman\n\n\n=== The Doomed and the Dammed ===\nIn October 2020, DC will release an 80-Page Giant called The Doomed and the Dammed.\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\nBatman: The Brave and the Bold\u2014The Bronze Age Omnibus\nVol. 1 collects The Brave and the Bold #74-106. 904 pages, January 2017, ISBN 978-1401267186\nVol. 2 collects The Brave and the Bold #110-156. 776 pages, September 2018, ISBN 978-1401281670\nVol. 3 collects The Brave and the Bold #157-200. 904 pages, September 2021, ISBN 978-1401292829\nThe Viking Prince by Joe Kubert collects The Brave and the Bold #1-5 and 7-24, 296 pages, July 2010, ISBN 978-1-4012-2777-7\nShowcase Presents: Justice League of America Volume 1 includes The Brave and the Bold #28\u201330, 544 pages, December 2005, ISBN 1-4012-0761-8\nSuicide Squad: The Silver Age collects The Brave and the Bold #25\u201327 and #37\u201339, 336 pages, July 2016, ISBN 1-4012-6343-7\nShowcase Presents: Hawkman\nVolume 1 includes The Brave and the Bold #34\u201336, #42\u201344, and 51, 560 pages, March 2007, ISBN 1-4012-1280-8\nVolume 2 includes The Brave and the Bold #70, 560 pages, August 2008, ISBN 978-1-4012-1817-1\nShowcase Presents: Green Arrow Volume 1 includes The Brave and the Bold #50, #71, #85, 528 pages, January 2006, ISBN 1-4012-0785-5\nThe Brave and the Bold Team-Up Archives Volume 1 collects The Brave and the Bold #50\u201356, #59, 224 pages, June 2005, ISBN 1-4012-0405-8\nShowcase Presents: Aquaman\nVolume 2  includes The Brave and the Bold #51, 528 pages, January 2008, ISBN 1-4012-1712-5\nVolume 3  includes The Brave and the Bold #73, 448 pages, February 2009, ISBN 1-4012-2181-5\nShowcase Presents: Haunted Tank Volume 1 includes The Brave and the Bold #52, 560 pages, May 2006, ISBN 1-4012-0789-8\nShowcase Presents: The Teen Titans\nVolume 1 includes The Brave and the Bold #54 and #60, 528 pages, April 2006, ISBN 1-4012-0788-X\nVolume 2 includes The Brave and the Bold #83 and #94, 512 pages, October 2007, ISBN 1-4012-1252-2\nShowcase Presents: Metal Men\nVolume 1 includes The Brave and the Bold #55, 528 pages, September 2007, ISBN 1-4012-1559-9\nVolume 2 includes The Brave and the Bold #66, 528 pages, September 2008, ISBN 1-4012-1976-4\nShowcase Presents: Metamorpho Volume 1 collects The Brave and the Bold #57\u201358, #66, and #68, 560 pages, October 2005, ISBN 1-4012-0762-6\nShowcase Presents: The Brave and the Bold \u2013 The Batman Team-Ups\nVolume 1 collects The Brave and the Bold #59, #64, #67, #69\u201371, #74\u201387, 528 pages, January 2007, ISBN 1-4012-1209-3\nVolume 2 collects The Brave and the Bold #88\u2013108, 528 pages, December 2007, ISBN 1-4012-1675-7\nVolume 3 collects The Brave and the Bold #109\u2013134, 520 pages, December 2008, ISBN 1-4012-1985-3\nBlack Canary Archives Volume 1 includes The Brave and the Bold #61\u201362, 224 pages, December 2000, ISBN 1-56389-734-2\nShowcase Presents: The Spectre Volume 1 includes The Brave and the Bold #72, 75, 116, 180, and 199, 616 pages, April 2012, ISBN 1-4012-3417-8\nLegends of the Dark Knight: Jim Aparo\nVolume 1 collects The Brave and the Bold #98, 100\u2013102, and 104\u2013122, 512 pages, April 2012, ISBN 978-1-4012-3375-4\nVolume 2 collects The Brave and the Bold #123-145 and 147\u2013151, 528 pages, October 2013, ISBN 978-1401242961\nVolume 3 collects The Brave and the Bold #152, 154\u2013178, 180\u2013182, 552 pages, September 2017, ISBN 978-1401271619\nBatman: The Strange Deaths of Batman includes The Brave and the Bold #115, 160 pages, January 2009, ISBN 978-1-4012-2174-4\nTales of the Batman: Don Newton includes The Brave and the Bold #153, 156 and 165, 360 pages, December 2011, ISBN 978-1-4012-3294-8\nTales of the Batman: Gerry Conway Volume 1 includes The Brave and the Bold #158, 161, 171\u2013174;
