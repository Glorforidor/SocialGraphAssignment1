Initially, the duo created new versions of &#39;&#39;[[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|The Sandman]]&#39;&#39;, and [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] (both of whom bore strong resemblance to their Captain America work), before deciding that \&quot;kid gangs seemed to be the way to go\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Ronin\&quot;/&gt; Teenage sidekicks ([[Batman]]&#39;s [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Captain America]]&#39;s [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]], etc.) were fast becoming a comics staple, intended to provide young characters with whom youthful readers could identify.&lt;ref&gt;Doubt has been cast of the veracity of this - ostensibly &#39;&#39;editorial&#39;&#39; - opinion (that child readers desired or required a child character with whom to identify). Notable comics commentators including [[Jules Feiffer]] have noted:\n:\&quot;The super grownups were the ones I identified with. There was still time to prepare. But Robin the Boy Wonder was my own age. One need only look at him to see he could fight better, swing from a rope better, play ball better, eat better and live better - for while I lived in the East Bronx, Robin lived in a mansion...\&quot;, [[Jules Feiffer|Feiffer, Jules]] &#39;&#39;The Great Comic Book Heroes&#39;&#39; (Crown, 1964) as quoted in [[James Van Hise|Van Hise, James]], &#39;&#39;Batmania&#39;&#39; ([[Pioneer Books]], 1989), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Simon &amp; Kirby&#39;s own &#39;&#39;Sentinels of Liberty&#39;&#39; (later the &#39;&#39;[[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]]&#39;&#39;) had already succeeded in this mold, and had an influence on their subsequent creation.\n\n[[Image:Detective Comics Issue 65 - debut Boy Commandos.jpg|left|thumb|180px|&#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; #65 (July 1942). Art by [[Jack Kirby]], [[Jerry Robinson]] and [[Joe Simon]].]]\nHaving already created the \&quot;[[Sentinels of Liberty]]\&quot; for Timely, they now created for DC the [[Newsboy Legion]] (\&quot;a [[Dead End Kids]]-style group led by a police officer in a Captain America-like blue-and-yellow costume, toting a shield\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Ronin\&quot;/&gt;). Although America had not yet entered the [[World War II|war]], headlines and news stories highlighted the role of British [[commando]]s, so Simon and Kirby fused the kid gang with the commando, and created &#39;&#39;&#39;The Boy Commandos&#39;&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe international group included the French Andre Chavard, the English Alfie Twidgett, the Dutch Jan Haasan and an American only known as \&quot;Brooklyn\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=Boy Commandos |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/boycoman.htm |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDebuting in the pages of &#39;&#39;[[Detective Comics]]&#39;&#39;&lt;ref&gt;Although that title had previously stuck largely to characters who were, as the title implied, &#39;&#39;detectives&#39;&#39; of some kind, the onset of war (and America&#39;s subsequent involvement in it) both inspired and was requested of comics companies to create patriotic heroes, such as Simon and Kirby&#39;s &#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; a year earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; #64 (the issue #65&#39;s cover &lt;small&gt;(left)&lt;/small&gt; shows [[Batman]] presenting the gang but they appeared first in the issue before) cover-dated June 1942, the team became extremely popular, also appearing in &#39;&#39;[[World&#39;s Finest Comics]]&#39;&#39; (#8-41, 1942-1949) and were then soon spun off into their own title,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 41 |quote = The inaugural issue of &#39;&#39;Boy Commandos&#39;&#39; represented Joe Simon and Jack Kirby&#39;s first original title since they started at DC (though the characters had debuted earlier that year in &#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; #64.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; launching with a &#39;Winter 1942&#39; date.

Among those hired was a young [[Gil Kane]], who recalls being:\n:\&quot;hired to do as many &#39;&#39;Boy Commandos&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Newsboy Legion&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;Sandman&#39;&#39; stories as I could... they gave me scripts and they would do the splashes and they would have it inked\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Ronin\&quot;/&gt;\n[[File:Boy Commandos 1.jpg|thumb|right|&#39;&#39;Boy Commandos&#39;&#39; #1 (December 1942).

An elite commando squad of orphaned children, led by grown-up &#39;&#39;&#39;Captain Rip Carter&#39;&#39;&#39;, they fought on all fronts of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt; \n\nIn September 1944, the Newsboy Legion teamed up with the Boy Commandos to stop armed and armored traitors based out of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Newsboy Legion Boy Commandos Special&#39;&#39; (Oct. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe team&#39;s adventures continued well past the war, even though there were many roster changes. Jan left first, having found relatives in his homeland to stay with. Alfie was replaced by a Texan named &#39;&#39;Tex&#39;&#39;. Percy Clearweather, a glasses-wearing genius, replaced Andr\u00e9.\n\nIt was revealed years later that Brooklyn was [[Dan Turpin]], that Andr\u00e9 Chavard had become the head of the French Intelligence &#39;&#39;[[List of government agencies in DC Comics#D\u00e9partement Gamma|D\u00e9partement Gamma]]&#39;&#39;, and that Alfie Twidgett was now the head of the firm &#39;&#39; Statistical Occurrences Ltd.&#39;&#39; (SOL), with his daughter Twiggie.\n\nIn addition to the aligning of Metropolis Special Crimes Unit&#39;s Detective [[Dan Turpin]] with \&quot;Brooklyn\&quot;, the team have seen print in a couple of titles since the late 1940s.\n\nIn the 1970s, during Kirby&#39;s involvement at DC, several of their stories were reprinted in various books, particularly those written and drawn by Kirby himself (e.g. &#39;&#39;[[Mister Miracle]]&#39;&#39; #6 in February 1972. A reprint &#39;&#39;Boy Commandos&#39;&#39; title was published in Sep/Oct 1973 under editor [[E.

Using his daughter \&quot;Twiggie\&quot; as a mediator, Alfie hires Murray Takamoto, an ex-[[S.T.A.R. Labs]] administrator (and college roommate of [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Ted Kord]]) who&#39;d worked on a [[Strategic Defense Initiative|\&quot;Star Wars\&quot; satellite]] program, which S.O.L. had received a contract concerning its protection.  Joining Alfie in this venture are his old teammates Andre, now head of the fictional Department Gamma of the [[Service de Documentation Ext\u00e9rieure et de Contre-Espionnage|French Secret Service]], Jan, now a professor working for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100109141121/http://www.hcss.nl/en/home Hague Centre for Strategic Studies], and their former mentor \&quot;Rip\&quot; Carter, now a general.  It was implied that they would eventually come into conflict, along with the Blue Beetle, with corrupt European industrialist Klaus Cornelius, who had already used his influence to disband Europe&#39;s lead super-hero agency, the [[Global Guardians]], and was working to resurrect the Boy Commandos&#39; old enemy [[Agent Axis]].  However, the series ended before the storyline could reach fruition, and no further developments have been mentioned since then, although Cornelius did make a brief cameo during [[Kurt Busiek]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Power Company]]&#39;&#39; miniseries.\n\nThey made an appearance in the most recent incarnation of &#39;&#39;[[The Brave and the Bold#Current volume|The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39; (issue #9, February 2008), in which they teamed up with fellow World War II heroes, the [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawks]].\n\n==Collection==\nDC published the first of 2 hardback collections of Simon and Kirby&#39;s work on the series:\n* &#39;&#39;The Boy Commandos&#39;&#39; Vol. 1, 2010, ISBN (reprints &#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; #64-73, &#39;&#39;World&#39;s Finest Comics&#39;&#39; #8-9 and &#39;&#39;Boy Commandos&#39;&#39; #1-2).\n* &#39;&#39;The Boy Commandos&#39;&#39; Vol. 2, 2015, ISBN (reprints &#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; #74-83, &#39;&#39;World&#39;s Finest Comics&#39;&#39; #10-13 and &#39;&#39;Boy Commandos&#39;&#39; #3-5).\n\n==See also==\n*[[CHERUB]]\n*[[Henderson&#39;s Boys]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/boycoman.htm Boy Commandos] at [[Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia]].
