The first version of the Suicide Squad debuted in &#39;&#39;[[The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39; #25 (September [[1959 in comics|1959]]) and the second and modern version, created by [[John Ostrander]], debuted in &#39;&#39;[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]&#39;&#39; #3 (January [[1987 in comics|1987]]).\n\nThe modern incarnation of the Suicide Squad is &#39;&#39;&#39;Task Force X&#39;&#39;&#39;\u2014a team of incarcerated [[supervillain]]s who undertake high-risk [[black ops]] secret missions in exchange for either [[parole]], [[work release]], and/or reduced prison sentences. Regardless of abilities and talent, every member of the squad is expendable and it is expected that not many will return. As expendable assets, all members are fitted with an explosive device in their neck to assure obedience. The Suicide Squad&#39;s name alludes to the dangerous nature of their missions. The team is based out of &lt;!-- don&#39;t delink --&gt;Belle Reve Penitentiary under the directorship of [[Amanda Waller]].\n\nVarious incarnations of the Suicide Squad have existed throughout the years as depicted in several self-titled comic book series, from its origins in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], to its modern-day Post-&#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]&#39;&#39; reimagining, to the current version that was introduced in 2020 . The current incarnation of the team appears in the sixth volume of the &#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; comic series, and the recurring members include [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], [[Killer Croc]], [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Deadshot]] and [[Harley Quinn]].\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n==Publication history==\nFeatured in &#39;&#39;The Brave and the Bold,&#39;&#39; the original Suicide Squad team included [[Rick Flag Jr.]], his girlfriend Karen Grace, Dr. Hugh Evans and Jess Bright.

Several such teams existed, but their history in comics is only scarcely recorded before [[Rick Flag|Rick Flag, Sr.]] becomes the leader of the team (and even then, only a few adventures of this Squad are shown). After the war ends, the team (together with the Argent group) is put under the umbrella organization of Task Force X. After his father&#39;s death, Rick Flag Jr. goes on to lead the group that is featured in &#39;&#39;The Brave and the Bold&#39;&#39; (vol. 1). A deadly encounter with a [[Yeti]] during a mission in [[Cambodia]] ends with Evans and Bright dead and sends Flag back to the U.S. with a wounded Karin Grace. After a stint with the [[Forgotten Heroes]], Flag is drafted into the Squad that Waller assembles in &#39;&#39;Legends&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;SO#14\&quot; /&gt;\n\n\&quot;A Princess&#39; Story\&quot; from &#39;&#39;Secret Origins&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #28 sheds light on Nightshade&#39;s origin, revealing that her mother hailed from the Land of the Nightshades. An ill-fated trip to this world ends with Nightshade&#39;s mother dead and her brother abducted, and Nightshade spends the following years honing her shadowy powers and building a reputation as a crimefighter. She falls in with [[King Faraday]] at the [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#C.B.I.|C.B.I.]]; Faraday eventually introduces her to Amanda Waller, who agrees to help her rescue her brother in exchange for Nightshade&#39;s participation in the Squad.&lt;ref name=\&quot;SO#28\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Origins&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #28&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Other World War II Suicide Squads===\nThe World War II Squad of &#39;&#39;Secret Origins&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #14 was a means of tying the Silver Age Suicide Squad to the war-era Suicide Squad (also called the Suicide Squadron) created by Robert Kanigher for his \&quot;[[The War that Time Forgot]]\&quot; tales in the pages of &#39;&#39;[[Star Spangled War Stories]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;WarStories\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Star Spangled War Stories&#39;&#39; #110\u2013111, 116\u2013121, 125, and 127\u2013128&lt;/ref&gt; This Suicide Squadron is described as a \&quot;top-secret [[United States Army Rangers|Ranger]] outfit\&quot; whose members were trained to tackle missions from which ordinary volunteers were not expected to return alive. It is unclear whether this team is part of the modern Suicide Squad canon or if the Squad introduced in &#39;&#39;Secret Origins&#39;&#39; was intended as a replacement for them in DC continuity.\n\nAnother classic version of the Squad (Rick Flag Jr., Karin Grace, Jess Bright, and Dr. Hugh Evans) appears in the non-canon 2004 miniseries &#39;&#39;[[DC: The New Frontier]]&#39;&#39; by [[Darwyn Cooke]]. The group is briefly shown undertaking the sorts of dangerous missions the Squad is known for, and Flag eventually drafts [[Hal Jordan]] onto the team to assist in preparing a [[Human spaceflight|manned space flight]] to [[Mars]]. The experimental rocket&#39;s test runs quickly goes south and the group (sans Jordan) dies in the explosion.&lt;ref name=\&quot;NewFrontier#1-4\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;DC: The New Frontier&#39;&#39; #1\u20134&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[DC Comics Bombshells]]&#39;&#39; continuity, the World War II-era Suicide Squad is led by Francine Charles and consists of Killer Croc, Enchantress, Rose Wilson, and Barbara Gordon (who in this setting is a vampire). In the final issue of the comic, it is revealed that after the end of the war, this Suicide Squad became a \&quot;[[Justice League Dark|Dark Justice League]]\&quot; defending the world against magical threats.\n\n==&#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; (vol. 1)==\n==={{anchor|Background (Suicide Squad vol. 1)}}Background===\nThe first volume of &#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39;, written by modern Squad creator [[John Ostrander]], launched in May [[1987 in comics|1987]], shortly after the team was introduced in the \&quot;[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]\&quot; crossover storyline. It lasted for 66 monthly issues, along with one annual and one special (&#39;&#39;Doom Patrol and Suicide Squad Special&#39;&#39; #1), both published in 1988.\n\nThis series details the covert operations of the modern, Post-&#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]&#39;&#39; Squad, created (in-universe) and directed by [[Amanda Waller]].

As a result of these developments, the Suicide Squad is exposed to the public, contrary to Flag&#39;s intentions. Flag flees the scene, while Deadshot is shot by the arriving police officers. Unfortunately for Deadshot, who has a death wish, he does not die from the injuries.\n\nResulting from the exposure, Amanda Waller is replaced by an actor named Jack Kale so that she can continue to run the Squad.

With the Suicide Squad on the verge of being disbanded by her superiors, Waller gathers [[Ravan (comics)|Ravan]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], and [[Deadshot]] in an assassination mission of the LOA. The deal for the villains is simple: the three will be set free after helping Waller kill the LOA.

She receives a presidential pardon, courtesy of [[Sarge Steel]], as well as money in the bank and her old privileges concerning the use of imprisoned villains.\n\nThis is done so that Waller can reassemble her Squad and prevent a confrontation between American and Soviet forces in the war-torn country of [[Vlatava (comics)|Vlatava]]. As the Suicide Squad succeeds and finishes their mission, they go in a new direction, free from the government as freelance operatives per the terms negotiated by Waller. Under the leadership of Waller, who now also goes into the field as an operative, they are a mercenary squad open to the highest bidder.\n\n====\&quot;Serpent of Chaos\&quot;====\nThis storyline ran through &#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) #45\u201347. Amanda Waller and the Squad covertly sneak into Jerusalem seeking to capture or kill [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]]. However, the squad&#39;s arrival is detected by the [[Hayoth]], and their Mossad liaison Colonel Hacohen takes Waller and Vixen into custody in order to show them that the Hayoth has already captured Kobra. Amanda figures out that Kobra allowed the Hayoth to capture him but is unsure of why. Judith follows Vixen to a meeting with the Bronze Tiger and Ravan, critically wounds Vixen, and is nearly killed by the Bronze Tiger. Meanwhile, the Atom discovers Kobra&#39;s true plan all along was to corrupt [[Dybbuk (comics)|Dybbuk]] the Hayoth&#39;s artificial intelligence team member. Kobra \&quot;corrupted\&quot; Dybbuk through a series of philosophical conversations about the nature of good and evil; he then attempts to use Dybbuk to start World War III. The day is saved by Ramban, the team&#39;s kabbalistic magician, who has a lengthy conversation with Dybbuk about the true nature of good and evil, choice, and morality. Meanwhile, Ravan and Kobra have their final battle which results in Ravan&#39;s supposed death via poisoning.\n\n====\&quot;Mystery of the Atom\&quot;====\n[[Batman]] is working to solve the murder of Ray Palmer, [[The Atom]]. He hears that Waller possibly knew about the explosion that killed him. Superman is told by a CBI agent that the Suicide Squad would be attempting to rescue [[Qurac]]&#39;s former President Marlo. Adam Cray confronts Deadshot about killing his father, Senator Cray.&lt;ref&gt;Suicide Squad #59, November, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Golem, of the [[Hayoth]] enters the facility holding Marlo on Blood Island. The Hayoth mistakenly believe they would be allowed to take President Marlo into custody. This misunderstanding caused the Hayoth to become embroiled in a four-way conflict with the [[Justice League]] ([[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Aquaman]]), who were there searching for Ray Palmer (the Atom), as well as the Suicide Squad, and the Onslaught. After a series of skirmishes, Superman ends the free-for-all with a shockwave caused by clapping both his hands together. The League confronts Ray Palmer and he tells them about Micro Force and their murder of Adam Cray, the man who had been impersonating him as a member of the Suicide Squad.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) #59\u201362&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====\&quot;Rumble in the Jungle\&quot;====\nThe series concludes in issues #63\u201366, in which the Suicide Squad travels to Diabloverde to depose a seemingly invulnerable and invincible dictator calling himself Guedhe. This despot has his own personal bodyguards, a group of villains calling themselves the Suicide Squad. Insulted by the rival team usurping the Suicide Squad name, Waller accepts the mission to liberate Diabloverde at the price of one peso, paid by an exiled resident, Maria.\n\nDuring that mission, they face off against and defeat the other Suicide Squad. Each Squad member travels through the mystic jungle to Guedhe&#39;s fortress and along the way, faces their personal demons, except for Deadshot. Amanda Waller tricks the despot, actually Maria&#39;s husband, into a form of suicide. The despot believes himself to be immortal, when in actuality, he was a formidable psychic whose consciousness kept animating his remains. Waller convinced him that her touch brought death and thus, he died. Afterward, Waller disbands the Suicide Squad and the series ends.\n\n===Membership: Amanda Waller&#39;s Squad===\n{{Main|List of Suicide Squad members#Suicide Squad (vol. 1) (1987\u20131992)}}\n\nNotable team members from &#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) include:\n\n{{Div col begin}}\n\n* [[Amanda Waller]]\n* [[Rick Flag Jr.]]\n* [[Bronze Tiger]]\n* [[Captain Boomerang]] (George \&quot;Digger\&quot; Harkness)\n* [[Count Vertigo]]\n* [[Deadshot]]\n* [[Joker (character)|Joker]]\n* [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] (Arthur Light)\n* [[Lashina|Duchess]] (Lashina)\n* [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]]\n* [[Punch and Jewelee|Jewelee]]\n* [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]] (Tom Tresser)\n* [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]]\n* [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] (Barbara Gordon)\n* [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]\n* [[Punch and Jewelee|Punch]]\n* [[Ravan (comics)|Ravan]]\n* [[Shade, the Changing Man]]\n* [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]] II (Cliff Carmichael)\n* [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Interim stories==\n\n==={{anchor|Background (Interim stories 1)}}Background===\nThough [[John Ostrander]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) series was canceled in 1992 with issue #66, the concept lived on in various DC storylines throughout the years.

In the episode \&quot;Task Force X\&quot;. Field commander [[Rick Flag Jr.]] recruits [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Deadshot]], [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]], and [[Clock King]] (who fulfills [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]&#39;s radio support role here) for a mission to appropriate the Annihilator automaton from the [[Justice League Watchtower]] on behalf of Project Cadmus.  The team attacks the Watchtower during its weakest point when there is a minimal number of super humans on duty.  They defeat Atom Smasher, Vigilante and Shining Knight with ease only running into problems when they encounter Martian Manhunter and Captain Atom. The team succeeds, but Plastique is critically wounded in the process. According to the series&#39; producers, this episode resulted from the realization that the Project Cadmus organization needed a solid victory to cement itself as a credible threat.\n* Task Force X appears in the &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Leverage.\&quot; While Amanda Waller runs the Suicide Squad which operates out of Belle Reve, its members consist of Flagg, Black Manta, Captain Boomerang, and Monsieur Mallah.

At the end of the episode, Waller shoots [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], who attempted to quit working for her. The end of the episode also reveals that [[Tess Mercer]] is a Checkmate agent. The Suicide Squad itself is featured in &#39;&#39;Smallville&#39;s&#39;&#39; 10th and final season; members who appear include Rick Flag, Deadshot (Floyd Lawton), Plastique (Jessica Parker Kennedy), and [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] (Emil LaSalle).

[[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] and [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]] work as part of the team, but are not implanted with explosives. Harley Quinn makes a cameo appearance, but is not called for duty. Scheffer is apparently killed by Waller as a result of him abandoning the mission. Diggle releases the team from custody in the season two finale \&quot;Unthinkable\&quot; to help him stop Waller from bombing [[Starling City]] to stop [[Slade Wilson (Arrowverse)|Slade Wilson]]&#39;s army. In \&quot;Draw Back Your Bow\&quot; [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]] hands over [[Carrie Cutter (Arrowverse)|Carrie Cutter / Cupid]] to Waller for the Suicide Squad to put her skills to use, having taken pity on her. In \&quot;The Brave and the Bold\&quot; it is revealed that [[Digger Harkness (Arrowverse)|Digger Harkness / Captain Boomerang]] was once a member of the Suicide Squad but his last mission became a failure and Michaels ordered the mission and him to be terminated, which proved to be unsuccessful. The team appears in the episode \&quot;Suicidal Tendencies\&quot;, when Lawton and Cutter accompany Diggle and Michaels to rescue [[Joseph Cray|Senator Joseph Cray]] from a hostage situation. The storyline depicts Lawton sacrificing himself to save the other three when it is revealed that Cray set up the attack to stage his own rescue, with the goal of using the reputation he would gain to mount a presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/157074_arrow_is_plotting_another_suicide_squad_episode_and_your_favorites_are_back/|title=EXCLUSIVE: &#39;Arrow&#39; Is Plotting Another Suicide Squad Episode \u2013 and Your Favorites Are Back!|publisher=ET Online|last=Ng|first=Philiana|date=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Waller&#39;s death at the hands of [[Shadowspire (Arrowverse)|Shadowspire]], Lyla Michaels becomes a new head of A.R.G.U.S. and begins to reform it; one of her acts is the disbandment of the Suicide Squad.

The Squad itself is cut from the story for brevity; only Flag and [[Hal Jordan]] remain.\n* The Suicide Squad appears in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]&#39;&#39; as the main focus of the film. The line up consists of [[Deadshot]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[King Shark]], [[Killer Frost]], [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Black Spider]] and [[KGBeast]] while [[Amanda Waller]] monitors their activities and controls their every move with bombs surgically implanted in all of their spines that will explode if they try to escape. KGBeast was killed as an example of Amanda Waller&#39;s claim when he thought she was bluffing. It is eventually revealed that [[Riddler]] was once also a part of the Squad. Riddler&#39;s knowledge of how to defuse Waller&#39;s bombs caused him to become a target of Waller, who sends the Squad after him. Throughout the course of the film, Black Spider and King Shark are killed via the bombs before they can be defused, Harley Quinn is eventually locked back up in Arkham (as seen in &#39;&#39;Batman: Arkham Asylum&#39;&#39;), Captain Boomerang is left on the Arkham grounds and re-captured by the GCPD and Deadshot escapes and attempts a hit on Waller, while Killer Frost&#39;s fate remains unknown.\n* The team appears in &#39;&#39;[[Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay]]&#39;&#39;. As in &#39;&#39;Batman: Assault on Arkham&#39;&#39;, [[Amanda Waller]] monitors their activities and controls their every move with bombs surgically implanted in all of their spines that will explode if they try to rebel or escape. The characters to be featured on the team are Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, [[Bronze Tiger]], [[Killer Frost]], and [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]]. [[Black Manta]], [[Count Vertigo]], [[Punch and Jewelee]] appear as members of the Squad in the opening of the film until Punch was killed by Count Vertigo and Jewelee during a mission to retrieve a flash drive containing leaked information from [[Tobias Whale]]. This causes Waller to detonate the bomb that is in Count Vertigo while Jewelee is killed by Deadshot. Three years later, Task Force X is reassembled with Captain Boomerang, Bronze Tiger, Killer Frost, Harley Quinn, and Copperhead as part of a mission to recover the stolen \&quot;Get Out of Hell Free\&quot; card. By the end of the movie, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang and Harley Quinn are the surviving members. Copperhead is killed when Amanda Waller detonated the bomb in his spine, Killer Frost was caught in the explosion by Copperhead&#39;s bomb and Bronze Tiger is brutally slashed by [[Professor Zoom]] and was sent to heaven when Deadshot placed the \&quot;Get out of Hell Free\&quot; card in his hands.\n* The team is mentioned in &#39;&#39;[[The Lego Batman Movie]]&#39;&#39;.\n* The Suicide Squad appears in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Dark: Apokolips War]]&#39;&#39;. Following [[Amanda Waller]]&#39;s death, the group is now led by [[Harley Quinn]] and consists of [[Captain Boomerang]], [[King Shark]], [[Black Manta]], [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], and [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]].\n\n===Video games===\n====&#39;&#39;Lego Batman&#39;&#39;====\n* A downloadable content pack in &#39;&#39;[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]&#39;&#39; features the New 52 versions of the Suicide Squad as characters. Named \&quot;The Squad\&quot; considering the implications of the word \&quot;Suicide\&quot; to the game&#39;s target audience, the pack&#39;s minifigures includes Amanda Waller, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, El Diablo, King Shark, Deathstroke, and Katana. In the DLC map, the Squad are ordered by Amanda Waller to find the person who infiltrated Belle Reve. By the end of the mission, it was discovered that Killer Moth had infiltrated Belle Reve as part of a plan to expose the existence of the Squad and was defeated by the Squad.\n* The Suicide Squad appears in &#39;&#39;[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]&#39;&#39;. In the game&#39;s storyline, [[Catwoman]] plans sends [[Killer Frost]] and the Rookie to [[Belle Reve (DC Comics)|Belle Reve]] to see if [[Harley Quinn]]&#39;s Task Force X acquaintances know her whereabouts. With [[Deadshot]] and [[Captain Boomerang]] in tow, the newly formed group heads to the Gotham Botanical Gardens to retrieve Harley. Upon arrival, Captain Boomerang cuts some vines, sending [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] into a rage. A battle ensues, until Catwoman intervenes and they reveal their intentions to Harley, who is quickly taken away by Deathstorm and [[Grid (comics)|Grid]], though she drops the [[Mother Box|artifact]] the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] found during the [[Wayne Enterprises|Wayne Tech]] break-in. The group rushes to rescue Harley, and she escapes with Ivy, Deadshot, and the Rookie while Killer Frost and Catwoman hold off the [[Crime Syndicate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CC-notice|cc=bysa3|url=https://lego.fandom.com/wiki/LEGO_DC_Super-Villains|author(s)=}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====&#39;&#39;Batman: Arkham&#39;&#39;====\n* In the post-credits of &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]&#39;&#39;, Amanda Waller recruits [[Deathstroke]] into the Suicide Squad, hinting at a possible Squad appearance in future &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham]]&#39;&#39; games, or the aforementioned Suicide Squad game.&lt;ref name=\&quot;BatmanArkham\&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/todays-new-batman-games-tease-a-very-cool-possible-seq-1452114405|title=Today&#39;s New Batman Games Tease A Very Cool Possible Sequel|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|publisher=Kotaku|date=October 25, 2013|accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this same game, if the player looks up the character trophy of [[Harley Quinn]], she can be seen holding a dossier similar to what Waller gives Wilson.\n* Several cut-scenes in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate]]&#39;&#39; implicate Amanda Waller and the Suicide Squad in the game&#39;s prison riot plot. Waller and Rick Flag Jr. are shown recruiting [[Bronze Tiger]] and Deadshot in the post-credits scene.&lt;ref name=\&quot;BatmanArkham\&quot; /&gt;\n* [[Rocksteady Studios]] announced that they were developing a new game centered around the team, titled &#39;&#39;[[Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League]].&#39;&#39; The announcement was accompanied by a teaser image of the game&#39;s logo in the style of a crosshair aimed at [[Superman]]. The game is set to be fully unveiled during the online event [[DC FanDome]] on August 22, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Square|first=Push|date=2020-08-07|title=Rocksteady Confirms Suicide Squad Is Its Next Game|url=https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/08/rocksteady_confirms_suicide_squad_is_its_next_game|access-date=2020-08-07|website=Push Square|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Other games====\n* Since the 14th update of &#39;&#39;[[DC Universe Online]]&#39;&#39; (June 2012) Hero and Villain characters could work together in PVP matches as the Player Character had been recruited into various Task Force X teams. This does not affect gameplay whatsoever apart from a brief message from Amanda Waller. This message is only given if there are not enough Heroes and Villains to occupy different teams.\n* The Official Suicide Squad movie game, on iOS and Android devices, was released in August 2016 as part of the movie promotion campaign.\n* The Suicide Squad is mentioned in &#39;&#39;[[Injustice 2]]&#39;&#39; by Harley Quinn and Deadshot, both of whom remark on the good memories. Enchantress mentioned not being fond of the Squad when she joined.\n* The Suicide Squad, though not mentioned by name, appear in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Enemy Within]]&#39;&#39;. If the Joker becomes a vigilante, it is revealed that Amanda Waller is using former members of the Pact (Harley Quinn, Bane and Catwoman) to work with her, using bomb collars and new technology as a means of control. The group are used against both Batman and Joker, though the former can negotiate for their release after he saves Waller from the latter.\n\n===Web series===\nThe Suicide Squad is first mentioned in the &#39;&#39;[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Being Harley Quinn\&quot; when the titular character mentions that the Squad is always trying to recruit her.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of government agencies in DC Comics]]\n* [[Checkmate (comics)]]\n* [[Janus Directive]]\n* [[Secret Six (comics)]]\n* [[Arman and Shiven: Through the Mirror (comics)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Suicide Squad|state=expanded}}\n{{The New 52}}\n{{DC Rebirth}}\n{{Secret Six}}\n{{Justice League characters}}\n{{Batman characters}}\n\n[[Category:Suicide Squad| ]]\n[[Category:Comics by John Ostrander]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1959]]\n[[Category:DC Comics adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Fictional military organizations]]\n[[Category:Lists of DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Supervillains with their own comic book titles]]\n[[Category:Batman characters]]&quot;</span>
