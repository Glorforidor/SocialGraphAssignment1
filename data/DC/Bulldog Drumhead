As [[Gerard Jones]] writes of Donenfeld&#39;s investment:\n[[Image:All-American Comics 16.jpg|thumb|&#39;&#39;[[All-American Comics]]&#39;&#39; #16 (July 1940), cover art by [[Sheldon Moldoff]].]]\n{{quote|text=Harry had agreed on one condition: that [Gaines] take [Detective Comics partner] [[Jack Liebowitz]] on as his partner. ... Jack would be tempted to leave and form a competing company if there was nothing to hold him. And it may well have been a way for Harry to keep Gaines under control; since Jack was still drawing a salary and significant bonuses from Detective Comics and [self-distributorship] [[Independent News]], he wouldn&#39;t let Gaines take off on his own or act against the interests of the other companies. ... Gaines became the principal and Jack Liebowitz the minority owner of All-American [Publications].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Jones\&quot;/&gt;{{rp|164}}}}\n\nWhile All-American, at 225 Lafayette Street in Manhattan, was physically separated from DC&#39;s office space uptown at 480 Lexington Avenue, it used the informal \&quot;DC\&quot; logo on most of its covers for distribution and marketing reasons.

As Jones describes,\n\n{{quote|Gaines saw the end of the superhero fad coming and wanted to get into something more durable, like children&#39;s books and magazines. ... In 1944, he decided he&#39;d had enough. He let Jack Liebowitz buy him out with a loan from Harry.... Liebowitz promptly orchestra the merger of All American Comics and Detective Comics into [[National Comics Publications|National Comics]], of which he was the junior partner, vice president, and publisher. Next he took charge of organizing National Comics, Independent News, and their affiliated firms into a single corporate entity, [[National Comics Publications|National Periodical Publications]]\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Jones\&quot;/&gt;{{rp|223}} }}\n\nBefore the merger, Gaines first rebranded All-American with its own logo, beginning with books cover-dated February 1945: &#39;&#39;[[All-Flash]]&#39;&#39; #17, &#39;&#39;[[Sensation Comics]]&#39;&#39; #38, &#39;&#39;Flash Comics&#39;&#39; #62, &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; #14, &#39;&#39;Funny Stuff&#39;&#39; #3, and &#39;&#39;[[Mutt &amp; Jeff]]&#39;&#39; &lt;ref name=\&quot;Mutt\&quot; group=\&quot;note\&quot;&gt;The comic book, unlike the comic strip, spelled its title with an ampersand.

Like many comics of the time, &#39;&#39;All-American&#39;&#39; debuted with a mix of [[newspaper]] [[comic strips]], reprinted in color, and a smattering of original, comic-strip-like features. Among the strips were three hits of the era: &#39;&#39;[[Mutt and Jeff]]&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref name=\&quot;Mutt\&quot; group=\&quot;note\&quot;/&gt; by [[Al Smith (cartoonist)|Al Smith]] ghosting for strip creator [[Bud Fisher]]; &#39;&#39;[[Skippy (comic strip)|Skippy]]&#39;&#39;, by [[Percy Crosby]]; and &#39;&#39;[[Toonerville Folks]]&#39;&#39; by [[Fontaine Fox]]. New content included &#39;&#39;[[Scribbly the Boy Cartoonist|Scribbly]]&#39;&#39;, a semiautobiographical Mayer feature about a boy cartoonist. &#39;&#39;All-American Comics&#39;&#39; lasted 102 issues through October 1948.\n\nAlso debuting that month was &#39;&#39;Movie Comics&#39;&#39; (\&quot;A full movie show for 10 cents\&quot;), featuring simple adaptations of movies using painted movie stills, as well as [[cartoonist]] [[Ed Wheelan]]&#39;s popular &#39;&#39;Minute Movies&#39;&#39; comics.  The first of its six issues through Aug. 1939 adapted no fewer than five films: &#39;&#39;[[Son of Frankenstein]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Gunga Din]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;The Great Man Votes&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Fisherman&#39;s Wharf&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;Scouts to the Rescue&#39;&#39;.\n\nThe next two comics were &#39;&#39;Mutt &amp; Jeff&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref name=\&quot;Mutt\&quot; group=\&quot;note\&quot;/&gt; which ran 103 issues from Summer 1939 - June 1958; and the company&#39;s superhero debut, &#39;&#39;Flash Comics&#39;&#39; #1 (Jan. 1940), which introduced the super-speedster title character, created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Harry Lampert]], as well as the Golden Age Hawkman and future Hawkgirl, by Fox and artist [[Dennis Neville]], and [[Johnny Thunder]], by scripter John Wentworth and artist Stan Aschmeier, among other features.\n\nThe Golden Age Green Lantern, from &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; writer [[Bill Finger]] and artist [[Martin Nodell]], debuted in &#39;&#39;All-American Comics&#39;&#39; #16 (July 1940), followed by the original Atom, created by Bill O&#39;Connor and penciler Ben Flinton, in &#39;&#39;All-American&#39;&#39; #19 (Nov. 1940). Wonder Woman was introduced in a nine-page story in [[All Star Comics 8|&#39;&#39;All Star Comics&#39;&#39; #8]] (Jan. 1942), the product of psychologist [[William Moulton Marston]] (under the [[pseudonym]] [[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]]) and Max Charles Gaines, and drawn by artist [[Harry G.
