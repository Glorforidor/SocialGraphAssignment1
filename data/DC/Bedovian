It is led by the [[supervillain]] [[Sinestro|Thaal Sinestro]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Sinestro Corps first appears in &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern]]&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #10 and was created by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Ethan Van Sciver]].&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fictional history==\n===Before the Corps===\n{{Main|Parallax (comics)|Sinestro|Green Lantern: Rebirth}}\n\nThe Parallax entity is a space parasite that is the embodiment of [[fear]] that was imprisoned within the Central Power Battery on [[Oa]]. As time passed, the entity became known as the yellow impurity, the cause for the power rings&#39; weakness to the color yellow.&lt;ref name=\&quot;rebirth3\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern: Rebirth&#39;&#39; #3 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThaal Sinestro, at the time the universe&#39;s greatest Green Lantern, was sent to Earth by [[Supernova (comics)|Supernova]] in a plot to erase [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] from history. [[Booster Gold]] was assigned to prevent this from happening. To do so, he convinced Sinestro to leave Earth, claiming that he was an admirer from the future, and that his yellow [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] flight ring was a tribute to Sinestro. When asked what Corps he belongs to, Booster ad-libbed, \&quot;The...Sinestro Corps\&quot;, leading Sinestro to twirl his mustache in thought while mumbling, \&quot;Of course...Of course.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;booster2\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Booster Gold&#39;&#39; #2 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter Sinestro went rogue, he was banished by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] to [[Qward]] in the antimatter universe. When he returned, he wielded a [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] which used yellow energy. After various encounters with Earth&#39;s [[Green Lantern]], [[Hal Jordan]], he was imprisoned within the Central Power Battery. There he was able to use his ring, which uses [[fear]], as opposed to [[will (philosophy)|willpower]], as a power source, to awaken Parallax from hibernation. From there, Parallax and Sinestro were able to influence the fall of Hal Jordan and instigate the fall of the Green Lantern Corps, leaving one last Green Lantern: [[Kyle Rayner]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;gl50\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #50 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;rebirth4\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern: Rebirth&#39;&#39; #4 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Recruitment drive===\n[[Image:Sinestro corps gather.jpg|225px|thumb|The Sinestro Corps gathers on Qward.]]\nAfter the [[Green Lantern Corps]] was restarted with the return of [[Hal Jordan]],&lt;ref name=\&quot;rebirth6\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern: Rebirth&#39;&#39; #6 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; the Sinestro Corps began actively recruiting members, offering yellow power rings and a role in the Corps to those who can \&quot;instill great fear\&quot;. Members of the Corps are immediately taken to Qward to \&quot;...be subjected to psychological and physical reconditioning\&quot;. The members of the Sinestro Corps work in sectors, like the Green Lantern Corps. Qward also has a huge yellow Central Battery on its surface like the one used on Oa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web\n |url         = http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=79802\n |title       = CATCHING UP WITH GEOFF JOHNS\n |last        = Rogers\n |first       = Vaneta\n |publisher   = [[Newsarama]]\n |date        = 2006-08-08\n |accessdate  = 2007-03-20\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207062700/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=79802\n |archivedate = 2007-02-07\n |df          = \n}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Sinestro Corps uses fear, and opposes the Green Lantern Corps and the Guardians, Sinestro has stated their goal is to bring order to the universe, which he claims the Guardians have failed to do.\n\n[[#Ring bearers|Arkillo]], a large and muscular vicious alien, is enslaving all the Qwardian Weaponers and forcing them to continuously build new yellow rings which are programmed to breach the barrier between the antimatter and matter universes to find and recruit new ring-wielders. Arkillo also serves as the Sinestro Corps&#39; drill sergeant, similar to [[Kilowog]]&#39;s role in the GLC.&lt;ref name=\&quot;gl11\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #11&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMembers recruited include Karu-Sil, raised by animals; Despotellis, a sentient virus capable of attacking Lanterns from the inside; and Bedovian, the sniper of the Corps, capable of taking out a target from three sectors away.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wizard Magazine&#39;&#39; #184 (February 2007), 2007 Preview, Sinestro Corps.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring this time, the Sinestro Corps attempted to recruit [[Batman]], known even to some alien races for his formidable ability to instill fear in others. However, Batman&#39;s willpower combined with his previous brief exposure to a power ring allowed him to reject the yellow ring before it took him to be properly trained and molded into one of Sinestro&#39;s soldiers. The yellow ring then sought a replacement and selected [[Amon Sur]], the disgruntled son of [[Abin Sur]], who was on Earth attempting to steal Hal Jordan&#39;s ring.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #17 (April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The prophecy===\nIt was revealed that after untold millennia, the Weaponers of Qward, Ranx the Sentient City, the Children of the White Lobe, and the Empire of Tears will rise united against the [[Green Lantern Corps]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;glca2\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Tales of the Green Lanterns Corps Annual&#39;&#39; #2 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; This was largely ignored up until upgraded [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]] started to appear throughout the universe. Hal Jordan encountered one on Earth and, with [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], followed their trail to Sector 3601. Hal and Guy found several Green Lanterns, all of whom were assumed to have been killed during the &#39;&#39;[[Emerald Twilight]]&#39;&#39; saga, and the Manhunters&#39; new grandmaster [[Hank Henshaw]], the Cyborg Superman. The Manhunters were defeated and Henshaw&#39;s head was brought to Oa.&lt;ref name=\&quot;gl15\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #15 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Oa has a forbidden chapter on cosmic prophecies, which includes the following:\n\n{{cquote|&#39;&#39;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n[[Hank Henshaw|A face of metal and flesh]] shall speak of the secrets of [[52 (comics)|the 52]].&lt;br&gt;\n[[Parallax (comics)|Fear]] will rise.&lt;br&gt;\n[[Ion (DC Comics)|Willpower]] will gather.&lt;br&gt;\nAnd a war of light will unleash the truth behind the power of the ring.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n|||Book Of Oa|&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #20}}\n\nAfter his interrogation, the Guardians learned that Henshaw is aware of the fifty-two parallel universes and that if New Earth was destroyed, the new Multiverse would collapse and the Antimatter universe would take its place. Two of the Guardians, [[Ganthet]] and [[Sayd]], warn the other Guardians not to ignore the prophecy because it could destroy the Green Lantern Corps.&lt;ref name=\&quot;glsc\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special&#39;&#39; #1 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The Sinestro Corps War===\n{{Main|Sinestro Corps War}}\nFollowing his defeat in &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]&#39;&#39;, the events of &#39;&#39;Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special&#39;&#39; #1 [[Sinestro]] retreats to the planet [[Qward]] in the antimatter universe. There he amasses an army, the Sinestro Corps, that he selects based upon their ability to \&quot;inspire great fear\&quot;. Each member is armed with a yellow power ring, mirroring the green ones of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. Amongst Sinestro&#39;s allies are [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] and the resurrected [[Anti-Monitor]]. The Sinestro Corps then launches an all-out assault against the Green Lantern Corps and the universe itself. During the assault on Oa, the Sinestro Corps manages to inflict heavy casualties and free [[Superboy-Prime|Superman-Prime]] and the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] from their imprisonment. [[Kyle Rayner]] is captured and transported to Qward, where Sinestro manages to separate Rayner from the [[symbiosis|symbiote]] [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion]] allowing Parallax to possess him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoff Johns]] (w), [[Ethan Van Sciver]] (a), Moose Baumann (col), Rob Leigh (let). \&quot;Sinestro Corps, Prologue: The Second Rebirth\&quot;. &#39;&#39;Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special&#39;&#39; #1 (Aug 2007), [[DC Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hal Jordan]], [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] return to Earth to warn the [[Justice League]] of the Anti-Monitor&#39;s return.\n\nAs the Sinestro Corps spreads out to ambush Green Lanterns across the universe, &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #23 sees the [[Guardians of the Universe|Guardians]] deciding to rewrite their sacred text, the Book of Oa. They add 10 new laws, the first of which authorizes the use of lethal force against the Sinestro Corps. As the Green Lanterns gather on Oa in preparation for a Sinestro Corps assault, the Sinestro Corps teleport themselves and their Central Power Battery instead to a new [[Warworld]], their objective revealed to be Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoff Johns]] (w), [[Ivan Reis]] (p), Oclair Albert (i), Moose Baumann (col). \&quot;Broken Laws\&quot;. &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #23, [[DC Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt; Events in &#39;&#39;Green Lantern Corps&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #16 show Hal informing the Green Lantern Corps of Sinestro&#39;s plans.&lt;ref name=\&quot;glc16\&quot;&gt;[[Dave Gibbons]] (w), [[Patrick Gleason (artist)|Patrick Gleason]] (p), Prentiss Rollins (i), Guy Major (col). \&quot;The Battle of Ranx\&quot;. &#39;&#39;Green Lantern Corps&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #16, [[DC Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #24 continues the story, with Green Lanterns and Sinestro Corps members battling across Earth. Hal manages to free Kyle from Parallax before the entity is imprisoned in their power batteries by Ganthet and Sayd.&lt;ref name=\&quot;gl24\&quot;&gt;[[Geoff Johns]] (w), [[Ivan Reis]] (p), Oclair Albert &amp; Julio Ferreira (i). \&quot;Home Invasion\&quot;. &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #24 (Dec 2007), [[DC Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt; After John and Guy arrive, the former Guardians reveal to them the prophecy of the \&quot;Blackest Night\&quot;, seen in &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #25. It foretells of five more Corps arising, each based on a different color and emotion. After the five corps are established, a \&quot;War of Light\&quot; will ensue, in which all the corps are destroyed, leading to the \&quot;Blackest Night\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;gl25\&quot;&gt;[[Geoff Johns]] (w), [[Ivan Reis]] &amp; [[Ethan Van Sciver]] (p), Oclair Albert, Julio Feirreira, &amp; [[Ivan Reis]] (i), Moose Baumann &amp; Rod Reis (col). \&quot;The Sinestro Corps War part 11\&quot;. &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #25, [[DC Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Guardians arrive on Earth and appoint Sodam Yat to be the new Ion. After a lengthy struggle in [[New York City]], the Sinestro Corps are defeated by the overwhelming numbers against them. One of the Guardians sacrifices himself to send Superman-Prime to an alternate universe, while Hal and Kyle subdue and arrest Sinestro in Coast City. In the aftermath of the battle, seen in &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #25, the Guardians decide to bring the second of the new laws into effect. After realizing that the \&quot;Blackest Night\&quot; prophecy will come to pass, Ganthet and Sayd depart after creating a [[power ring (DC Comics)#Blue|blue power ring]] with the intention of creating their own Corps, based on the spreading of [[Hope]] to the rest of the universe. The Anti-Monitor, having been blown across the vacuum of space at the battle&#39;s climax, finds itself on a dark planet. There it is transformed by an unknown force into a [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|Black Power Battery]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;gl25\&quot; /&gt;\n\n===Blackest Night===\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\nFollowing the Sinestro Corps War, the [[Green Lantern Corps]] tracked down the abandoned Sinestro rings and prevented them from finding new bearers. Among these is Amon Sur&#39;s ring, which attempts to recruit the self-proclaimed \&quot;Master of Fear\&quot;, [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;gl27\&quot;&gt;[[Geoff Johns]] (w), [[Mike McKone]] (p), [[Andy Lanning]], Marco Alquiza, and [[Mark Farmer]] (i), Jo smith (col). \&quot;The Alpha Lanterns Part II\&quot;. &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #27, [[DC Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving members of the Sinestro Corps continue to try to bring fear to the Green Lanterns, in part by murdering the family members of Green Lanterns.&lt;ref name=\&quot;glc28\&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile, [[Mongul#Son of Mongul|Mongul]] (who had since obtained a yellow ring in the aftermath of the war) begins his quest to take command of the Sinestro Corps in their namesake&#39;s absence. After obtaining an additional five rings by killing corpsmen who refused to follow him, Mongul takes over the planet [[Daxam]] and then a large contingent of the Sinestro Corps, after besting Arkillo in one-on-one combat, he becomes the new leader of the Sinestro Corps. In \&quot;Rage of the Red Lanterns\&quot; #1, a group of rogue Sinestro Corps members still loyal to Sinestro release him from Green Lantern custody as he is being transferred for execution. Their rescue attempt is temporarily spoiled by an attack from [[Atrocitus]] and his newly formed [[Red Lantern Corps]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;fcrrl\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns&#39;&#39; #1 (December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSinestro is abducted by Atrocitus&#39; forces and brought to the Red Lantern base planet: Ysmault. Planning to use Sinestro&#39;s blood for their own means, Sinestro&#39;s faction of the Sinestro Corps eventually arrive and liberate him from the Red Lanterns. After their escape, Sinestro and his faction of the Sinestro Corps return to Qward, revealing that there is a backup Central Power Battery. Sinestro orders his men to free the Sinestro Corps members imprisoned on Zamaron by the [[Star Sapphire (comics)#Star Sapphires|Star Sapphires]] and meet him on the darkside of Daxam&#39;s moon. After Sinestro attends to \&quot;family business\&quot;, they will retake the Sinestro Corps from Mongul.&lt;ref name=\&quot;gl38\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #38 (February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to those members imprisoned on Zamaron, Sinestro Corps members are also being held prisoner on Oa. Their power rings are held in containment along with other rings (abandoned due to casualty in war) that were prevented from finding new bearers. When Red Lantern [[Red Lantern Corps#Prominent members|Vice]] is freed from confinement in his sciencell, he attacks the Green Lantern jailer.&lt;ref name=\&quot;glc34\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern Corps&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #34 (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Though the imprisoned members of the Sinestro Corps initially cheer him on, they find that he is just as likely of attacking them in his rage. During the jail break, [[Scar (comics)|Scar]] frees the yellow power rings and they find their bearers in the sciencells. Upon being reunited with her ring, [[Lyssa Drak]] claims to once again be able to feel the Book of Parallax.

Ethan van Sciver has also stated that there will be a &#39;Frankenstein&#39;-inspired member who is two aliens cut in half and sewn together (with each one bearing a power ring, so that they are two bodies acting as one), and \&quot;Strange Little Robots\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Van Schiver Newsarama\&quot;/&gt; The \&quot;&#39;Frankenstein&#39;-inspired member\&quot; made a small appearance in the &#39;&#39;Sinestro Corps Special&#39;&#39;, appearing behind Sinestro.

Two resembled a [[Xenomorph (Alien)|Xenomorph]] and a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]].

Born when one of the earliest life forms first felt terror, it is insect-like in appearance. Parallax was the first of the seven entities to be captured by a still unknown person and currently is held captive in Ryut. The Sinestro Corps insignia is based on drawings created by life forms who looked into the mouth of Parallax, and lived to tell the tale.\n\n==Book of Parallax==\nThis book apparently holds in its pages all the history of the greatest Sinestro Corpsmen histories. For unknown reasons the book was chained to Lyssa Drak with yellow energy from Sinestro himself. This was possibly for the need to have a historian for his Corps and a way for Sinestro to revisit his Corps&#39; success. Lyssa Drak is quite loyal to Sinestro and highly devoted to updating the Book and keeping it safe. A power ring is needed to translate the Book&#39;s text into words familiar to the ring wielder. Before a candidate of the corps enters a fear lodge, their power rings are drained by the Book of Parallax. Recently, Lyssa Drak has become the embodiment of the book.\n\n==Weapons and equipment==\n{{Main|Power ring (DC Comics) #Yellow|l1=Power ring}}\n[[File:Sinestro Corps power ring.jpg|150px|right|thumb|A Yellow Power Ring]]\nMembers of the Sinestro Corps use yellow power rings built on Qward. Though functionally similar to a Green Lantern&#39;s power ring, yellow power rings are fueled by fear instead of willpower. Members are selected for their skill at intimidation and terror. The ring amplifies the aggressive tendencies of the wearer. The yellow rings are charged by yellow power batteries, which are in turn linked to a yellow Central Power Battery based on Korugar. Aside from the recharging limitations common among the various Corps, their only known weakness is that their power can be drained by a [[Blue Lantern Corps|Blue Lantern&#39;s]] power ring.&lt;ref name=\&quot;gl38\&quot; /&gt;\n\n==Other versions==\n* The Sinestro Corps is featured in the &#39;&#39;[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]&#39;&#39; digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]].\n* The Lightsmiths: In the universe prior to the current one, groups managed to tap into the wellspring of power created by the Emotional Spectrum. In this universe those who tapped into the yellow light were known as the Lightsmiths of the Yellow Light of Terror.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; #23.1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39;, an alternate universe version of Sinestro as a hero is presented on the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Injustice Syndicate]] earth. He possess a slight variation of his Sinestro Corps uniform.\n* The Sinestro Corps appear in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Action]]&#39;&#39;. Known members are Sinestro and Despotellis. In \&quot;The Ringer,\&quot; Sinestro was battling Hal Jordan while Despotellis was guarding the Sinestro Corps Battery in Sinestro&#39;s ring even when Superman, Wonder Woman, and Atom joined the fight. When Atom defeated Despotellis by changing his chemical structure, this shorted out Sinestro&#39;s ring, allowing Green Lantern to defeat Sinestro.\n\n===Film===\n* In the animated movie &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern: First Flight]]&#39;&#39;, when Sinestro is given possession of the yellow power battery and ring, his Green Lantern uniform transforms into a uniform exactly the same as his Sinestro Corps uniform in the comics, complete with the same symbol. Aside from the uniform, however, there are subtle indications that Sinestro had the same plans for an organized military force.\n* The Sinestro Corps appear in &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern: Emerald Knights]]&#39;&#39; as part of a prophecy that Atrocitus tells Abin Sur of. Besides Sinestro, several prominent members are featured: Arkillo, Lyssa Drak, Kryb, Maash, Karu-Sil, Romat-Ru, Slussh and Tri-eye.\n* The second trailer for the 2011 film &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]&#39;&#39; contains a short segment featuring the symbol of the Sinestro Corps. The closing scene of the film also features Sinestro putting on a yellow ring, whereupon his uniform changes to that of the Sinestro Corps.\n\n===Video games===\n* The members of the Sinestro Corps make a cameo appearance during Hal Jordan&#39;s ending depicted in &#39;&#39;[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]&#39;&#39;. They are shown battling the Green Lantern Corps for control of the Pyramid of Argus.\n* The Sinestro Corps appear in &#39;&#39;[[DC Universe Online]]&#39;&#39;. The rings of the Sinestro Corp have been experiencing malfunctions and they blame the Green Lanterns. Arkillo appears as a bounty for Heroes.\n* In the video game &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters]]&#39;&#39;, while the Sinestro Corps do not feature directly, the Manhunters acquire similar powers to the Sinestro Corps when they attempt to harness the power of the yellow energy kept contained by the Guardians to use as a weapon against the Green Lantern Corps.\n* The Sinestro Corps version of Batman is a playable skin in the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows version of &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham City]]&#39;&#39;. The skin can be unlocked by using a code contained in the Blu-ray of the &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; film (code only available for PS3), by purchasing the Arkham City Skins Pack which features all available skins (which is available for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.&lt;ref&gt;http://arkhamcity.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=4642&lt;/ref&gt; ), or by purchasing the \&quot;Game of The Year\&quot; edition of &#39;&#39;Arkham City&#39;&#39;. The costume is also available in Batman: Arkham City Armored Edition for the [[Nintendo Wii U]].\n* In the parallel universe of &#39;&#39;[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]&#39;&#39;, Hal Jordan has joined the Sinestro Corps in his role as enforcer for [[Superman]]&#39;s Regime, with Sinestro as another agent of the Regime. Hal\u2019s transformation into \&quot;Yellow Lantern\&quot; was a result of Sinestro playing him and framing Guy Gardner for John Stewart\u2019s death, whom Sinestro murdered behind Hal\u2019s back. When Superman is nearly killed by a kryptonite bullet fired by Black Canary, a yellow power ring finds him which he uses to remove the bullet. He then seemingly kills Canary while becoming a member of the Sinestro Corps. [[Nightwing]], who in this reality is [[Damian Wayne]], becomes a member of the Sinestro Corps in his Single Player ending.\n** The sequel game &#39;&#39;[[Injustice 2]]&#39;&#39; reveals that [[Doctor Fate]] actually saved Canary from Sinestro\u2019s attack, and that she faked her death by sending her to another universe where she died instead of their universe\u2019s [[Green Arrow]], until she and her son are brought back to their universe alongside the alternate Green Arrow, after Regime\u2019s defeat. In the prequel comics for the game, it is shown that, some time during his rehabilitation, Hal Jordan learned the truth behind John Stewart\u2019s death and, eneraged that he was manipulated by Sinestro into murdering Guy Gardner, attracts the Red Lantern Corps, who attempt to have him join their ranks. In Hal\u2019s ending, Sinestro escapes from his cell where he supposedly died during the Red Lanterns&#39; and Starro\u2019s attacks, forcing Hal to become a Yellow Lantern once again and go undercover to apprehend him, though he expresses his concerns that the ring\u2019s fear spectrum might take over his mind.\n* The Sinestro Corps appear in &#39;&#39;[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]&#39;&#39;. Sinestro and Arkillo are featured as playable characters, while Batman&#39;s Sinestro Corps uniform appears as a downloadable alternate skin for the character.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{comicbookdb|type=team|id=597|title=Sinestro Corps}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071027070834/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003000991.cfm &#39;&#39;Wizard&#39;&#39; Article on the members of the Sinestro Corps]\n*[http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Aprl07/previews/apr25th.html &#39;&#39;Newsarama&#39;&#39; Sinestro Corp Preview]\n\n{{Green Lantern}}\n{{Justice League characters}}\n\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillain teams]]\n[[Category:DC Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Green Lantern characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Geoff Johns]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ethan Van Sciver]]&quot;</span>
