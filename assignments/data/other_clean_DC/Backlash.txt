The DC Universe's version of the Aryan Nation is a white supremacist terrorist organization that created a designer virus which would attack and destroy "non-white" DNA in humans. They were secretly led by U.S. Senator Sanders Hotchkins. When several noted chemists began disappearing, they drew the FBI's attention. The FBI contacted Hannibal Martin, the Justice League Task Force's liaison, and the Martian Manhunter assembled a covert team to infiltrate the terrorists. While undercover, Hourman was forced to use his powers and drew the attention of the Aryan Nation's superhuman enforcers who call themselves the Aryan Brigade. Thanks to Blind Faith's mental powers, the Aryan Brigade was able to uncover and surprise the Task Force. They captured all but Hourman who returned to free them. In the meantime, the Nation had readied its virus for delivery into the atmosphere. J'onn followed the rocket and forced it to detonate in space. All members of the organization were subsequently arrested.Following this, the Aryan Brigade's members were recruited by the Overmaster to be part of his new Cadre.

=== Television ===
A male version of Heat Monger named Lucious Coolidge appears in The Flash season three episode "Cause and Effect" portrayed by Richard Zeman. Lucious Coolidge, nicknamed Heat Monger, is a criminal and arsonist in Central City and an enemy of the Flash and Kid Flash. Coolidge became known as Central City's most notorious arsonist ever since Mick Rory "went off the grid". At some point, he was defeated by the Flash and arrested by the Central City Police Department. At Coolidge's trial, he glared at Cisco Ramon and Julian Albert when they made fun of his codename. Cecille Horton was the prosecution in his case. Barry went up to testify, but unknown to Judge Hankerson and Coolidge, Barry had lost all of his memories. As such, he botched the testimony and Judge Hankerson allowed Coolidge to walk. Upon his release, Coolidge was back to his old tricks, setting fire to a large office building. However, he was defeated by Barry (who had recently regained his memories) and Kid Flash. Heat Monger was arrested again.


=== Film ===
