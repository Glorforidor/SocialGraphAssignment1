The team is mostly composed of the children and heirs of the [[Justice Society of America]], making them the Society&#39;s analogue to the [[Teen Titans]], which was originally composed of sidekicks of [[Justice League]] members. Created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Jerry Ordway]], and Mike Machlan, they first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[All-Star Squadron]]&#39;&#39; #25 (September [[1983 in comics|1983]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 203 |quote = The children of the original Justice Society of America made their smash debut in this issue by writer Roy Thomas and penciler Jerry Ordway... &#39;&#39;All-Star Squadron&#39;&#39; #25 marked the first appearances of future cult-favorite heroes Jade, Obsidian, Fury,&lt;!--Hippolyta \&quot;Lyta\&quot; Trevor made her first appearance in &#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #300 (Feb. 1983), &#39;&#39;All-Star Squadron&#39;&#39; #25 was her first appearance using the name \&quot;Fury\&quot;--&gt; Brainwave Jr., the Silver Scarab, Northwind, and Nuklon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an eponymous comics series starring the group,&lt;ref&gt;Manning \&quot;1980s\&quot; in Dolan, p. 207: \&quot;Written by DC&#39;s Golden Age guru Roy Thomas and drawn by Jerry Ordway, &#39;&#39;Infinity, Inc.&#39;&#39; was released in DC&#39;s new deluxe format on bright Baxter paper.\&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; which ran from March [[1984 in comics|1984]] through June [[1988 in comics|1988]].\n\n==Publication history==\n[[Roy Thomas]] and his wife, [[Dann Thomas]], wrote the series throughout its run. Artists on the series included [[Jerry Ordway]], [[Don Newton]], [[Todd McFarlane]], [[Michael Bair]] and Vince Argondezzi.\n\nThe group was organized by [[Sylvester Pemberton]], the original [[Star-Spangled Kid]], in &#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; #1, when a number of JSA prot\u00e9g\u00e9s were denied admission to the JSA and instead formed their own group.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Infinity, Inc. were known as Infinitors.\n\nThe series ended in 1988 with the death of the Star-Spangled Kid (by then known as [[Skyman]]), and, presumably, the group disbanded shortly thereafter. Several members of Infinity, Inc. have gone on to supporting roles in other comics series. [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]] filled a pivotal role in &#39;&#39;[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]&#39;&#39; and is the mother of [[Daniel Hall (comics)|Daniel Hall]]. [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Hourman]], [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], Nuklon (as [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]]), [[Hector Hall|Silver Scarab]] (as [[Doctor Fate]]), and [[Power Girl]] eventually joined the 21st century incarnation of the JSA.\n\nOriginally, the series took place on the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel world]] of [[Earth-Two]], but in [[1986 in comics|1986]] it was merged with the rest of DC continuity following &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39;. From then on, they shared their spot as Los Angeles&#39; superteam with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], and were involved in a crossover with the [[Teen Titans|New Teen Titans]].\n\n==Fictional team biography==\n{{Cleanup-tense|section|date=December 2008}}\n\n===&#39;&#39;Infinity, Inc.&#39;&#39; (vol. 1, 1984\u20131988)===\n\n====Formation====\nHector Hall, Lyta Trevor, Norda Cantrell, and Albert Rothstein decide to adopt identities of their own and apply for membership in the [[Justice Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/infinity.htm |title=Infinity, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four of them adopt the codenames of [[Hector Hall|Silver Scarab]], [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]], [[Northwind (comics)|Northwind]], and [[Albert Rothstein|Nuklon]] respectively. They are turned down but, not willing to give up, they apply again with [[Jade (comics)|Jennie-Lynn Hayden]] and [[Obsidian (comics)|Todd Rice]]; these two suspect they are [[Alan Scott]]&#39;s children (revealed as true in &#39;&#39;Infinity Inc. Annual&#39;&#39; #1). Taking pity on the youngsters, [[Star-Spangled Kid]] decides to leave the JSA to create a new group, and they are joined by [[Power Girl]], the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]], and [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave, Jr.]]. They call themselves \&quot;Infinity, Inc.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; #1 (March 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe team first faces the Justice Society of America, turned evil by the Stream of Ruthlessness, thanks to the [[Ultra-Humanite]]. They defeat the JSA and the Ultra-Humanite and save the world.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; #2\u201311 (May 1984 \u2013 February 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference (to garner media attention for the new team), the team publicly divulge their secret identities, revealing those of their parents in the process, and Hector also announces his engagement to Lyta. The Star-Spangled Kid is able to form a partnership with the city of [[Los Angeles]] to commission his team as for-hire protectors and purchases Stellar Studios to revitalize its production of movies.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; #12 (March 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Helix====\nFury is kidnapped in an extortion attempt by the villains known as Helix, all products of invitro genetic manipulation by the mad scientist Doctor Love. The original members are Arak the Wind-walker, Baby Boom, Kritter, [[Mister Bones]], Penny Dreadful, and Tao Jones. They are defeated by the Infinitors, but manage to escape.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; #16\u201318 (July \u2013 September 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLater, the second [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]], [[Yolanda Montez]], learns that she is a cousin of new Helix member Carcharo and that they are products of the same genetic experiments as Helix. The two teams battle to a stalemate; Mister Bones is arrested, but the others escape.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; #25\u201329 (April \u2013 August 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Crisis on Infinite Earths====\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}\nThe teams are involved within the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] event, which ultimately results in three new superheroes \u2014 [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez]] as Wildcat, [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler]] as Hourman, and [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel]] as Dr. Midnight \u2014 who all join Infinity, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; #31 (October 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; The Crisis had severe changes for three members of the team. The Justice Society, who are written out of the DC universe proper by editorial decision and are exiled into a dimension where they constantly fight against the tide of [[Ragnarok]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Last Days of the Justice Society&#39;&#39; (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====The Silver Scarab saga====\nEven with all of his friends at Infinity, Inc., Hector Hall leaves the group after a fall-out with Lyta, following shortly after the team learns that the Justice Society is seemingly gone. The other members go around notifying the wives and other related characters of the Society of the JSA&#39;s disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; #30 (September 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; A certain Professor James Rock has also contacted Hector, but the real James Rock is supposed to be long dead. Travelling to Hall Mansion, Northwind means to confront Hector, only to find him already under Hath-Set&#39;s manipulations (Hath-Set has been reincarnated as a female Dr. Hastor and used the alias of Professor James Rock).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; #37 (April 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHector goes on to kidnap Fury, and he and Hath-Set uncover the Eye of Ra, a powerful and ancient weapon. Northwind returns and leads Infinity, Inc. into a final confrontation with the Silver Scarab at Hall Mansion, which, when burned down, reveals a topless pyramid inside. While Northwind confronts the Silver Scarab in a duel, Nuklon saves Fury.\n\nThe Eye of Ra denies the Silver Scarab control and flies away. The Silver Scarab is not pure enough in the eyes of Seketh the Egyptian god of Death, for the pureness of Hector&#39;s heart still lives on in his unborn child with Lyta. Therefore, he is not fully cleansed of his goodness and the Silver Scarab is thrown away by the Eye&#39;s power, the armor of [[Nth Metal]] an empty shell. Northwind is able to close the Eye of Ra, while Hath-Set escapes. Infinity, Inc. mourn the loss of Hector, and Northwind and Fury leave the team after his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; #42\u201344 (September \u2013 November 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA very pregnant Lyta goes home to spend time with her parents. When Nuklon goes to visit her (and profess his love for her), she tells him she isn&#39;t over Hector yet and that she only has friendly feelings for him. Disappointed, he discovers that there is a prowler sneaking around the property peeking in on Lyta. Nuklon captures him and discovers him to be Hector Hall, the new Sandman. Hector reveals that his spirit wound up in the dream dimension after the scarab ejected it from his body. The former Sandman Garrett Sanford had died after years of service and his assistants Brute and Glob conscripted Hector to replace him. They put Hector into Garrett&#39;s body and gave him a new life. He can only come out of the dream stream for one hour a day, but it&#39;s enough for him and Lyta to rekindle their relationship.\n\n====Death in the Family====\nDuring the wedding of Hector and Lyta Trevor-Hall, [[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]] (Marcie Cooper) uses deception to have Bones and Skyman meet at [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy&#39;s]] room.\n\nShe then deceives Solomon Grundy into grabbing Bones&#39; arm and using him to kill Skyman with his [[cyanide]] touch. Upset, Bones leaves and Infinity, Inc. finds him with Helix. Dr. Love had gained control of Helix and orders them to kill Bones. Helix turns on Love, killing him instead. Helix then leaves in disgust, telling Bones he is no longer one of them. The Infinitors, though, granted Bones full membership in the team. Afterwards, the Infinitors decide to continue on in Skyman&#39;s memory, but apparently decided to disband some time after anyway.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; #51\u201353 (June \u2013 August 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Infinite Crisis===\nA post-&#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; version of the original Infinity, Inc. appeared in &#39;&#39;Justice Society of America Annual&#39;&#39; #1 in 2008, and is known as the &#39;&#39;Justice Society Infinity&#39;&#39; after it merged with its world&#39;s Justice Society of America. The Earth-2 versions of Silver Scarab, Fury, [[Jade (comics)|Jade]], and Northwind are members, but their Superman is missing, their Flash is retired and their [[Green Lantern]] (Alan Scott) is dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=137685|title=&#39;&#39;Justice Society of America Annual&#39;&#39; #1}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===JSA: Black Reign===\nThe closest that Infinity, Inc. has come to reforming is when Brainwave (under Mr. Mind&#39;s thrall), Atom Smasher, and Northwind, along with [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]] and [[Eclipso]] (who at the time was being controlled by the cousin of the second Wildcat), were [[Black Adam]]&#39;s army in Khandaq. Black Adam mentions in an internal monologue that he had also thought of recruiting Power Girl for the group, further strengthening the Infinity, Inc. ties.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;JSA&#39;&#39; #56\u201358 (March \u2013 April 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Hawkman&#39;&#39; vol. 4, #23\u201325 (March \u2013 April 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===52===\n{{See also|52 (comics)}}\n[[File:\&quot;52\&quot; (no. 21, front cover).jpg|Cover art for &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39; #21, featuring Luthor&#39;s Infinity, Inc. Art by J.G. Jones.|200px|thumb]]\n\nIn the aftermath of &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39;, [[Lex Luthor]], clearing his name, resurfaced as a legitimate businessman offering a [[Metahuman|metagene]]-based therapy, called the \&quot;Everyman Project\&quot; to regular people which enabled them to develop superpowers. The therapy spawned six perfect specimens, to whom Luthor gave the identities purchased from the Pemberton Estate. Calling his new dream-team \&quot;Infinity Inc.\&quot;, he created Starlight ([[Natasha Irons#Starlight|Natasha Irons]], the team&#39;s leader), a new [[Nuklon]], a male [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]], a new [[Skyman]], the shapeshifting [[Everyman (DC Comics)|Everyman]], and the rebellious speedster Trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week 21 (September 27, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nUnbeknownst to the team, Luthor is able to \&quot;shut off\&quot; any of the team&#39;s powers at any time as he does to Trajectory during a battle, causing her death. Trajectory has since been replaced by [[Supergirl (Matrix)#The new Matrix|Matrix]], a pin-up model who has displayed superhuman strength and invisibility, similar to the original Matrix.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week 25 (October 25, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA new member, a new version of [[Jade (comics)#Nicki Jones|Jade]] with plant-based powers, debuted with the team on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. This led to the team being attacked by an angry [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], the brother of the original Jade, who had recently died. Alan Scott intervenes and breaks up the fight. Infinity, Inc. then claims that the older heroes will soon be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week 29 (November 22, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis version of Infinity, Inc. makes frequent appearances in the local media, acting both as a commercial stunt for the \&quot;Everyman Project\&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dccomics.com/sites/52/?action=headlines&amp;i=6762 | title=Lola&#39;s Lair: Starlight has &#39;Star Quality&#39; | work=Daily Planet 52 Week Special | publisher=DC Comics.com | first=Lola | last=Barnett | date=November 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a control system against rogue metahumans spawned from the Project itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dccomics.com/sites/52/?action=headlines&amp;i=6890 | title=&#39;Everyman&#39; Subject Turns to Crime | first=Josef | last=Schuman | work=Daily Planet 52 Week Special | publisher=DC Comics.com | date=November 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nNatasha begins to collect evidence against Luthor and the Everyman Project for [[Steel (John Henry Irons)]] and enlists Skyman to help her. Skyman is later killed by Everyman, who then assumes his identity, and reveals Natasha&#39;s duplicity to Luthor.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week 39 (January 31, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Luthor captures Natasha as bait to lure out Steel and reveals that he has used the exo-gene therapy on himself and now possesses the same powers as [[Superman]]. Recruiting the [[Teen Titans]], John Henry storms LexCorp to rescue Natasha.\n\nThe Titans take on Nuklon and others while Irons faces Everyman and Luthor. Luthor severely injures Irons and impales him with his own hammer before Natasha is able to destroy Lex&#39;s exo-gene with an electromagnetic pulse from Steel&#39;s hammer, allowing him to be easily knocked out. Afterwards, the remaining members of Infinity, Inc., along with Luthor&#39;s bodyguard Mercy, are taken into custody while Natasha and John Henry reunite.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week 40 (February 7, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn &#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; Week 50, day six, Nuklon, Jade, Matrix, and Fury are seen among the heroes during [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]. Alan Scott asks them to help in the final push against [[Black Adam]], only for them to refuse and flee the battlefield.\n\n=== &#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; (vol. 2, 2007 \u2013 2008) ===\n{{Infobox comic book title|\n| title=Infinity Inc.

Art by Max Fiumara.|thumb|left]]\n\nDan DiDio revealed at a DC Nation panel in Los Angeles that a new Infinity, Inc. ongoing series would debut in September [[2007 in comics|2007]] with John Henry Irons as the main character. The book was written by [[Peter Milligan]] with art by Max Fiumara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web\n |title=DC NATION PANEL FROM WW:LA\n |publisher=[[Newsarama]]\n |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105423\n |date=2007-03-16\n |accessdate=2007-03-18\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320015505/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105423\n |archivedate=2007-03-20\n |df= \n}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe first issues focuses on Natasha Irons (formerly Starlight), Erik Strom (formerly Fury), and Gerome McKenna (formerly Nuklon), a year after the end of the Everyman Project.  Natasha is living with her uncle John Henry Irons and is in [[psychotherapy]] along with Erik, who refers to it as \&quot;our national religion\&quot; and Gerome. Another longtime patient, teenager Dale Smith, attacks his therapist and realizes his powers as a [[Energy vampire|psychic vampire]]. Smith takes the name \&quot;Kid Empty\&quot;. Apparently, a side effect of the exogene therapy is that once the exogene itself is suppressed, the energies unleashed by the therapy remains, re-enabling the metagene in a different fashion.  As a result, Natasha finds herself turning to a mist-like substance, McKenna gains the ability to duplicate himself, and Strom gains a powerhouse, overconfident, female alter-ego. The group gain new members in [[Mercy Graves]] and Lucia, an Everyman subject who can psychically inflict pain on others. In #8, the team gains official costumes and codenames, and go on their first mission.\n\nIn issue #10, Mercy admits she is not ready to be on a team, and leaves.  Issue #11 begins a two issue arc that ties into the [[Dark Side Club]].\n\n[[Desaad]], under the false identity of \&quot;Doctor Bud Fogel\&quot;, secretly manipulates McKenna (now using the codename of \&quot;Double Trouble\&quot;) by nurturing a third personality created from McKenna&#39;s base and repressed instincts, and promising it the opportunity to take full control.\n\nWhen the splintered McKenna personality is able to wrest control over the main body (as shown when McKenna&#39;s main personality is transported in Desaad&#39;s labs, while his duplicate attempts to force himself on Lucia), the Infinitors try to stop him.\n\nHowever, the plan is revealed to be a trap. The duplicate fatally wounds McKenna in the hopes of possessing his body, but disappears with McKenna&#39;s weakening. The other subjects are trapped in a machine designed to take away the powers of the remaining Everymen without activating their metagene. Desaad admits he was forced to this course of action because the Everymen, even after turning into metahumans, are undetectable from Darkseid&#39;s minions, and they could be a wild card during the planned &#39;&#39;[[Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39;.\n\nAs a side effect of the machine, the Infinitors vanish. Steel, who arrives too late, swears he will resume his search for Natasha.\n\nThey have recently reappeared briefly in the third issue of the &#39;&#39;Terror Titans&#39;&#39; mini-series imprisoned by Desaad. Towards the end of the miniseries, an undercover [[Miss Martian]] tips Irons off about their imprisonment in the Terror Titans&#39; headquarters, leading to their release.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Membership ==\n\n=== &#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; ===\n\n==== Founding members ====\n{{main|List of Infinity Inc. members}}\n\n==== Proposed members ====\n[[File:IIHarlequin.png|150px|thumb|right|Gay male Harlequin from the original Infinity, Inc. pitch.]]\nIn the original pitch for the Infinity, Inc. series, creators [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Jerry Ordway]] had planned on using a young [[homosexual|gay]] male as a new Harlequin.\n\nIn an interview with &#39;&#39;Alter Ego&#39;&#39;, Ordway explains: &#39;&#39;\&quot;Northwind is shown\u2014but at his side (see P. 33) is a new, young, male Harlequin, who Jerry&#39;s notes suggest might become \&quot;comics&#39; first gay character. Or we could just assume it.\&quot; Not a bad idea, and maybe we should have played it that way; but we were already going to have two Green Lantern-derived heroes in Infinity, Inc.\&quot;&#39;&#39;\n\n[[File:LaGarro.jpg|thumb|left|La Garro appearing alongside the founding Infinitors in a promotion for &#39;&#39;Infinity, Inc.&#39;&#39; from &#39;&#39;All-Star Squadron&#39;&#39; #28.]]\nIn promotional material appearing in &#39;&#39;All-Star Squadron&#39;&#39; #28, a [[Catwoman]]-like figure, riding what is referred to as a cat-cycle, appears alongside the Infinity, Inc. group. A caption refers to her as \&quot;La Garro\&quot;. She, however, never appears in any of the team&#39;s adventures, or its comics under this name. She was later developed into the future Infinitor, the second [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)]].\n\n[[Sandy Hawkins]] aka Sandy the Golden Boy, sidekick to the [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)]], is also referred to as a member, but does not end up being a member of the team. Roy Thomas briefly toyed with the idea of giving the character super-powers based on Sandy&#39;s time as a sand-monster but this was dropped because Thomas and others felt he could have ended up as the DC equivalent to Marvel&#39;s Sandman. This had the potential to further confuse a situation that had been a minor irritant between DC and Marvel from time to time. It was ultimately decided that with the cast as large as it had become Sandy was one of the characters that could be dropped.\n\n=== &#39;&#39;Crisis on Infinite Earths&#39;&#39; ===\nAfter the events of the Crisis, the [[Golden Age (comics)|Golden Age]] Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman no longer existed. This affected three Infinitors directly:\n\n* [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]] remained in Infinity Inc., but was [[retcon]]ned into being the birth daughter of &#39;the Golden Age Fury&#39; (a character created for the purpose of the retcon) and being raised by the 1940s heroine [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]].\n* [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|The Huntress]] was killed in &#39;&#39;Crisis on Infinite Earths&#39;&#39; #12 and was retconned out of existence. Post-Crisis, a new Huntress appeared with no direct connection to the Batman. Her new origin was considered too different for her to have been an Infinitor, and she is no longer considered to have been a member.\n* [[Power Girl]]&#39;s origin was [[retcon]]ned so that she was now the granddaughter of the [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] mage [[Arion (comics)|Arion]] and was sent into the future. She is still considered to have been an Infinitor, and  her initial origin as a Kryptonian from the alternate reality of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]] and the cousin of the [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Superman]] has been restored.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;JSA: Classified&#39;&#39; #1\u20134&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Later members ===\n{{main|List of Infinity Inc. members}}\n\n=== Allies ===\n* [[Pat Dugan]], formerly the hero Stripesy, acted as team&#39;s mechanic.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) #28&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], acted as Jade&#39;s protector.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) #36&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Jonni Thunder]], a female private detective.\n\n=== &#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; ===\n{{main|List of Infinity Inc. members}}\n\n== In other media ==\nInfinity, Inc. was first mentioned in &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]: [[Young Justice: Outsiders|Outsiders]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Unknown Factors\&quot;. The team made their first appearance in the episode \&quot;Antisocial Pathologies\&quot; and is composed of [[Trajectory (comics)|Trajectory]], an unnamed black female and an unnamed white male. Near the end of the season, it&#39;s revealed that they were created by Lex Luthor to discredit the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] and secretly assist [[Secret Society of Super Villains|the Light]].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=title|id=2128|title=&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; (1984)}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=title|id=15162|title=&#39;&#39;Infinity Inc.&#39;&#39; (2007)}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://toonopedia.com/infinity.htm Infinity, Inc.] at [[Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia]].
