{"batchcomplete":"","query":{"pages":{"699700":{"pageid":699700,"ns":0,"title":"Ghost Rider","extract":"Ghost Rider is the name of many antiheroes and superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.  Marvel had previously used the name for a Western character whose name was later changed to Phantom Rider.\nThe first supernatural Ghost Rider is stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze, who, in order to save the life of his father, agreed to give his soul to \"Satan\" (later revealed to be an arch-demon named Mephisto). At night and when around evil, Blaze finds his flesh consumed by hellfire, causing his head to become a flaming skull. He rides a fiery motorcycle and wields blasts of hellfire from his body, usually from his skeletal hands. He eventually learns he has been bonded with the demon Zarathos. Blaze was featured in the Ghost Rider series from 1972 to 1983.\nThe subsequent Ghost Rider series (1990\u20131998) featured Danny Ketch as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by ninja gangsters, Ketch came in contact with a motorcycle that had somehow been mystically enchanted to contain the essence of a Spirit of Vengeance. Blaze reappeared in this 1990s series as a supporting character, and it was later revealed that Danny and his sister were Johnny Blaze's long-lost siblings. In 2000s comics, Blaze briefly again became the Ghost Rider, succeeding Ketch. In 2013, Robbie Reyes became Ghost Rider as part of the Marvel NOW! initiative.\nIn May 2011, Ghost Rider placed 90th on IGN's \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\" list. Nicolas Cage starred as the Johnny Blaze iteration of the character in the 2007 film Ghost Rider and its 2012 sequel, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Gabriel Luna played Robbie Reyes in the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n\n\n=== Johnny Blaze ===\n\nFollowing the western comics character who originally used the name, the first superhero Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze, debuted in Marvel Spotlight issue #5 (August 1972), created by Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas,  writer Gary Friedrich and artist Mike Ploog. He received his own series in 1973, with penciller Jim Mooney handling most of the first nine issues. Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller Don Perlin began a considerably long stint with issue #26, eventually joined by writer Michael Fleisher through issue #58. The series ran through issue #81 (June 1983). Blaze returned as Ghost Rider in a 2001 six-issue miniseries written by Devin Grayson; a second miniseries written by Garth Ennis in 2005, and an ongoing monthly series that began publication in July 2006. Johnny Blaze was the son of Naomi Blaze and Barton Blaze, Naomi being the previous Ghost Rider.\n\n\n=== Noble KaleHe would become the first Ghost Rider. Noble lived in the eighteenth century and grew up with his abusive father Pastor Kale and his younger brother Dante. ===\nNoble fell in love with a black girl named Magdelena. But, because of the color of her skin and his father\u2019s strong religious views, the couple kept their love a secret from the world. They were forced to tell Pastor Kale when Magdelena bore Noble\u2019s child.  Noble and Magdelena were then married.\nShortly after the marriage, Magdelena discovered Pastor Kale\u2019s dark secret; he was a servant of the dark lord Mephisto. In order to cover up Magdelena\u2019s findings, Pastor Kale accused her of witchcraft and had her burned at the stake. Knowing that his son, Noble, would object, he had him drugged, tortured and beaten in the church cellar.\nJust before Magdelena died, she used a curse to summon demons that avenge wronged women.  The demons were called \"Furies\" and they started killing the townspeople.  Fearing death, Pastor Kale struck a deal with Mephisto. In return for his safety, Mephisto got Noble\u2019s soul.  Mephisto realized that Noble was attached to a piece of the Medallion of power, and he activated the piece to transform Noble into the original \"Spirit of Vengeance.\"  When Ghost Rider had destroyed the Furies, Pastor offered him human flesh - Noble's son. Noble, in the guise of Ghost Rider, was unwilling to eat his own child, and he killed himself.\nWhen Mephisto later appeared to claim Noble's soul, Mephisto's brother, the archangel Uriel, appeared and demanded that the soul of Noble Kale be spared. No agreement could be reached, and therefore a compromise was made whereby Noble's soul could not be claimed by either realm; but instead, his soul would remain in the void until rebonded with certain members of his family.Noble Kale was also established as an ancestor of Jennifer Kale.\n\n\n=== Danny Ketch ===\n\nThe next Ghost Rider, a young man named Daniel \"Danny\" Ketch (Johnny Blaze's long lost little brother), debuted in Ghost Rider vol. 2, #1 (May 1990). This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, although his costume was now a black leather biker jacket with spiked shoulder-pads, grey leather pants, and a mystic chain he wore across his chest, which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon. His new motorcycle resembled a futuristic machine and the front of it could lower to serve as a battering ram. Like the original Ghost Rider's bike, the wheels were composed of mystic hellfire. Unlike the relationship between the previous Ghost Rider and the demon with which he was bonded, Ketch and his demon\u2014who in vol. 2, #91 (December 1997) is revealed to be Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment\u2014are cooperative with each other. At the close of the series with vol. 2, #93 (Feb. 1998), Ketch apparently died. The following year, however, Peter Parker: Spider-Man #93 (July 1999) revealed Ketch was still alive. Nearly a decade later, Marvel published the long-completed final issue as Ghost Rider Finale (Jan. 2007), which reprints the last issue and the previously unpublished #94.\n\n\n=== Alejandra Jones ===\nDuring the 2011 storyline \"Fear Itself\", a Nicaraguan woman named Alejandra Jones becomes Ghost Rider through a ritual performed by a man named Adam. Though she demonstrates many previously unknown powers of the Ghost Rider entity, she is deprived of its full power when Johnny Blaze takes back most of this power.\n\n\n=== Robbie Reyes ===\n\nIn 2013, a new character took on the Ghost Rider mantle: a Mexican-American resident of East Los Angeles named Roberto \"Robbie\" Reyes, who drives a black classic muscle car reminiscent of a modified 1969 Dodge Charger rather than a motorcycle. Robbie Reyes was created by writer/artist Felipe Smith and designed by Smith and artist Tradd Moore.\n\n\n=== Cosmic Ghost Rider ===\n\nIn the alternate reality of Earth-TRN666, where Thanos conquered all the Universe, Frank Castle's early life was seemingly similar to that of the Frank Castle of the Earth-616 Universe. However, when Thanos came to Earth, the Punisher was one of the last casualties during the last stand of the heroes and his soul was subsequently sent to Hell. Willing to give anything in order to punish Thanos for slaughtering his planet, the Punisher signed a demonic deal with Mephisto and became the Ghost Rider. When he returned to Earth, however, Thanos was already gone and everything on the planet was dead. Roaming endlessly and undying with no one to kill or love, the Ghost Rider spent the next countless years alone. He eventually began to lose his mind when even Mephisto fell silent to his calls. When a badly injured Galactus arrived on Earth seeking help against Thanos, unaware that the population of Earth had already been killed by him, the Ghost Rider offered the dead planet to him in exchange for the chance of punishing the Mad Titan as his herald which the Great Devourer accepted. Bestowed with the Power Cosmic, Ghost Rider became Cosmic Ghost Rider.\n\n\n=== Ghost / The Rider ===\nDue to the Celestial Progenitor presence influencing human evolution, in 1,000,000 B.C., certain humans became much more intelligent than others as well as able to speak a new language. However, they had to hide that gift from their brethren for fear of being ostracized. One day, a boy that was gifted with the ability to speak is approached by a mysterious stranger that also possessed that gift, only to witness the stranger transform into a beast and devour his entire tribe. The stranger allowed the boy to live and names him \"Ghost\" before telling him to challenge him when he is worthy. The boy was forced to survive on his own, though he does befriend a woolly mammoth. After almost dying in the harsh environment, he is approached by Mephisto in the form of a snake, who tells him to say its name. Ghost does that and is bonded with a Spirit of Vengeance; after which he imbued his newly acquired hellfire into the mammoth. Other humans had never seen someone ride an animal before and began referring to Ghost as \"The Rider\". The Rider continued his search and five years later, eventually caught up with the man who devoured his tribe. The man transformed once more, revealing himself to be the first Wendigo. During the fight, the Rider took the bones of the dead that Wendigo had killed and used them to form a weapon; the earliest version of Ghost Rider's signature chain. The Rider fought Wendigo until finally it and the Rider's woolly mammoth tumbled over a cliff. Afterwards, Ghost was approached by Odin and Lady Phoenix to join the prehistoric version of the Avengers.Upon imbuing his hellfire into another woolly mammoth, Ghost Rider assisted the prehistoric Avengers (consisting of Agamotto, Odin, Lady Phoenix, and prehistoric versions of Black Panther, Iron Fist, and Star Brand) in fighting an out of control Celestial called the Fallen; which resulted in his woolly mammoth getting killed in action. Ghost Rider swore revenge and assisted his teammates in defeating the Fallen and sealing it away underground in what would become South Africa. Ghost Rider later assisted the prehistoric Avengers in fighting the First Host.\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nThe Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a skeletal superhuman wreathed in ethereal flame and given supernatural powers. The motorcycle he rides can travel faster than any conventional vehicle and can perform seemingly impossible feats such as riding up a vertical surface, across water, and leaping across great distances that normal motorcycles cannot. The Ghost Riders are virtually indestructible and notoriously hard to injure by any conventional means, as bullets and knives usually pass through them without causing pain (knives are shown to melt while in their body). It is possible that they are genuinely immortal, as it is said that God created them and only God can destroy them. Despite being composed of bone and hellfire, the Ghost Riders possess formidable superhuman strength, enough to easily pick up a truck and hurl it across a road. It has been stated that Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider can press around 25 tons (50,000 lbs) (or more as seen in World War Hulk). Each Ghost Rider entity also had abilities specific to him or her.\n\nJohnny Blaze\nOriginally when Blaze transformed into Ghost Rider, his body changed but not the clothes he was wearing. In his new incarnation, this is different and his clothes take on a different appearance with a spiked leather jacket and chains. As Ghost Rider, he can cause his motorcycle to transform and surround itself with hellfire or he can create a new cycle from pure hellfire. He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon. His hellfire \"burns the soul\" without leaving physical injuries on the victim and its effects have been seen as similar to the \"Penance Stare.\" In his new incarnation, Blaze is now possibly the most powerful hero on Earth. During \"World War Hulk\", it was stated by Doctor Strange that Ghost Rider might be equally as powerful as the \"Green Scar\" persona of Hulk and could possibly defeat him. During this series, Doctor Strange also states that Ghost Rider protects only the innocent, which none of the Illuminati are. In recent comics, Blaze's Ghost Rider has been given the \"Penance Stare\" and mystical chain, both of which were specific to the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider. Blaze also uses a shotgun and discovered that he can discharge hellfire from the weapon when he first encountered Ketch. Now, he also has new abilities including hellfire breath, the ability to produce chains from either his throat or chest, and the ability to travel between incorporeal realms.Danny Ketch\nWhen Ketch transformed into Ghost Rider, his clothes changed with him, taking on the appearance of a spiked leather jacket with chains with a dollar, gray leather pants, and spiked gloves and boots. Likewise, his motorcycle underwent a radical transformation, changing from a conventional one into a high-tech motorcycle (this transformation was not strictly limited to the motorcycle he was found in the cemetery with as he was once seen able to transform another cycle in \"Ghost Rider/Wolverine/Punisher: Hearts of Darkness\"). Along with flaming wheels that allow the bike to nearly fly across surfaces, the bike included a shield-like battering ram on the front. As the Ghost Rider, Ketch used a mystical chain which responded to his mental commands. It could grow in length, alter direction while in the air, stiffen into a staff or spear, and separate into several links which can strike like shrapnel and then return to their original form. Daniel's most famous power was the Penance Stare. By locking eyes with a target and mentally focusing, the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider was able to make the target experience all the pain they had ever inflicted on anyone else. However, some beings have shown resistance to this ability, such as Venom and Carnage as their alien symbiote \"costumes\" do not technically have eyes; and Madcap, who is so masochistic, he claims to enjoy the experience. In the 1994 Fantastic Four animated series, this ability was shown to be powerful enough to bring down the mighty Galactus, as Ghost Rider forced Galactus to feel the pain of all those who had died as a result of his feeding on their planets; as Ghost Rider put it, \"A billion souls\". This display of power, though, appeared to simply be a rewrite for the animated series, as the original storyline in Fantastic Four issue 243 has Doctor Strange casting a spell that causes all of the souls of those Galactus had killed by his feedings to be visited upon him at once. Originally, this incarnation of the Ghost Rider could only be summoned if Danny was present when \"innocent blood was spilled\" (an innocent simply being threatened was not enough), at which time Danny had to touch the gas cap of his motorcycle for the transformation process to occur. Later, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider without touching the gas cap but still needed to wait for innocent blood to be spilled. Later still, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider by willpower alone.Robbie Reyes\nThe ghost of Eli Morrow that inhabits Robbie's body is not, according to Johnny Blaze, a true Spirit of Vengeance. Regardless, he gives Robbie several abilities similar to that of other Ghost Riders, including the power to manifest and control chains ending in thin knives or sickles. The black muscle car that Morrow's ghost initially inhabits is linked to Robbie's Ghost Rider form, allowing him to instantly teleport to and/or merge with the car. The car can also be driven remotely, and Robbie's Ghost Rider form can pass harmlessly through it, allowing it to drive into foes. The car's trunk, when opened, acts as a portal, allowing the Ghost Rider to transport anything, including people, to any location. Though it is initially unknown if Robbie's Ghost Rider form possesses the divine powers of his predecessors, he eventually displays the ability to use the Penance Stare during a battle with Star Brand. Eli is able to take full control of Robbie's body when the teen gives in to his negative emotions, signified by a pallid skin tone and both of his eyes turning orange. His Ghost Rider form also displays the ability to change into a more powerful and demonic form when Robbie is sufficiently angered. At the end of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s fourth season, to prevent the Darkhold from being used again, he slung his flaming chains in the same manner as a Sling Ring, allowing him to travel the Multiverse and take the book with him for safekeeping.\n\n\n== Other Spirits of Vengeance ==\n\n\n=== Vengeance ===\nMichael Badilino, an ex-member of the New York City Police Department, is one-third of an \"Organic Medallion of Power\"; the other two are Ketch and Blaze (the Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail). He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, although he also possesses the Penance Stare and his motorcycle seemed to share characteristics with the Noble Kale version. His appearance is distinguished by a deep purple skull, large fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and backswept curved horns on the top of his skull.\nIn his superhuman form, Badilino was called Vengeance, and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance would also take on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by that name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire, the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider.\nVengeance reappears in the last four issues of Ghost Rider vol. 2, involved in Blackheart's plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aids the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, destroying Blackheart and ruling Hell during Ketch's absences.\n\n\n=== The Last Stand of the Spirits of Vengeance ===\nSeven riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat.  Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission: to collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts. Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself, for which he needs the powers of the riders to tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on the heavens.\n\n\n=== Trail of Tears ===\nA version of Ghost Rider appeared in the miniseries Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears #1\u20136 (April\u2013Sept. 2007) by writer Garth Ennis and artist Clayton Crain. Set during the American Civil War, it finds Confederate officer Travis Parham avenging the murders of his friend, an ex-slave named Caleb and Caleb's family.

Angered, Mephisto sought revenge against Ghost Rider, and now constantly tries to win his creation back. Mephisto appears under the name Mephistopheles in the 2007 film Ghost Rider.\nOrb\nCrash Simpson's (mentor to Johnny Blaze) partner in his traveling motorcycle stunt show, Drake Shannon lost most of his face in a challenge against Crash for the business. Given an eyeball-like helmet by They Who Wield Power that was able to hypnotize others, he would return to try and reclaim the stunt show but was foiled by Ghost Rider.

Ultimate Ghost Rider's origin is explained in Ultimate Comics: Avengers volume 2, #4. One day while on a cross-country trip across the United States, twenty-something couple Johnny Blaze and Roxanne Simpson come across a bar where they befriend a biker gang, who plies them with beer. The gang's friendly demeanor is a ruse, as they kill the intoxicated Blaze as part of a Satanic ritual. During the ritual, they barter their souls with Satan in exchange for wealth and power. Satan grants their request but maintains the upper hand. The deceased Blaze also makes a deal that Satan will get his soul in exchange for the assured safety of Roxanne. For twenty years Blaze trains to become the Ghost Rider, burning away his Christian baptism, and is sent into the world to get his revenge. He tracks down and kills the members of the motorcycle gang\u2014now rich and in positions of power\u2014individually. In response to these deaths, the White House issues an Executive Order kill the Ghost Rider. The Avengers are recruited for the mission with no knowledge of the Ghost Rider except that he is 7 ft tall and has the strength of Thor. When the Avengers are unsuccessful in stopping the Ghost Rider from killing his next target, the truth behind the Ghost Rider's selection of targets is learned, and the Vice President of the United States, Michael Blackthorne is revealed to be the former leader of the motorcycle gang, who sold his soul to become a Ghost Rider, AKA Vengeance, into which Blackthorne now transforms. During their confrontation, the Ghost Rider drags Vengeance into a church which turns them both back into human form, allowing the Punisher to finish off Blackthorne. After pleading his case, Blaze is allowed to leave. He is later seen in a park with Satan watching Roxanne, who was brought back to life with no memory of what happened. Satan agrees to let her live her life if Blaze continues to be his Ghost Rider, to which Blaze agrees.\n\n\n=== Ghost Rider 2099 ===\n\nZero Cochrane, who in the Marvel 2099 alternate timeline is a cybernetic take on the Spirit of Vengeance, is not a supernatural being, but a cybernetic being with a digitized copy of Cochrane's mind.

However after the Disney bought Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion dollars, Sony decided to return the TV rights to Spider-Man to Marvel, cancelling any planned seasons and episodes for The Spectacular-Spider-Man.  \n\n\n==== Marvel Cinematic Universe ====\n\nIn July 2016, it was announced that Ghost Rider would make his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in the fourth season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Marketing had teased at the introduction of the Spirit of Vengeance, and the studio confirmed via San Diego Comic-Con, that the Ghost Rider would feature heavily in the series. The Robbie Reyes incarnation of the Ghost Rider, portrayed by actor Gabriel Luna, features as a recurring character in season four; influencing the season's marketing subtitle, Ghost Rider; which later became known as the first of three 'Pods' of the season; a new feature for the television series. Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider is referenced throughout the season, and has a cameo in the episode \"The Good Samaritan\". Blaze rescues Reyes and his brother from a car accident caused by gang members and revives the former from the dead by giving Reyes the supernatural abilities of the Spirit of Vengeance. As Robbie only saw Johnny in his Ghost Rider form, he believes that he sold his soul to \"The Devil\". While Blaze is not named explicitly in the episode, series star Clark Gregg confirmed the character's identity via his Twitter account. Mack becomes host to the Ghost Rider for a time after Reyes becomes trapped between dimensions and the Spirit of Vengeance temporarily separated from him. In the season finale, Phil Coulson briefly becomes the Ghost Rider as part of a trap to defeat the season's primary antagonist, AIDA / Ophelia / Madame Hydra.\nIn October 2016, Luna discussed that there are plans for Reyes to feature in his own television series, following his introduction in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.. In later interviews, the actor stated he hopes Norman Reedus would portray Johnny Blaze in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. On May 1, 2019, it was announced that a television series based on Robbie Reyes's incarnation of Ghost Rider would premiere on Hulu in 2020, with Luna reprising his role. Hulu decided not to move forward with the series in September 2019.\n\n\n==== Animation ====\nIn the X-Men: The Animated Series first-season finale, Professor X scans Gambit's memories and sees Ghost Rider, apparently approaching Gambit.\nThe Danny Ketch version of Ghost Rider appeared in the Fantastic Four episode \"When Calls Galactus\" voiced by Richard Grieco.
