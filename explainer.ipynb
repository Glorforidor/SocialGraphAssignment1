    "Security people - as the world of IT becomes more widespread and increasingly complex, many security vulnerabilities arise which could potentially have an enormous impact on a company or worse case a whole country. There are a few guardians who dedicate their life to secure the IT infrastructure so we all can sleep peacefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to explore how many security people there are and find out if they generally know each other. \n",
    "Find out if they can be split into two communities of offensive vs defensive security. \n",
    "Within these communities, we could try to use some Natural Language Processing to detect which community speaks most loudly and potentially see if there is a sentimentally difference.\n",

    "Many security people uses Twitter as the communication platform to share their discoveries, insights and thoughts about security vulnerabilites and how to fix those.\n",
    "Therefore, we will use the Twitter API to extract data about these people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extraction was conducted into 4 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Broad extraction of security people.\n",
    "2. Extraction user friendships.\n",
    "3. Extraction user information such as description and location.\n",
    "4. Extraction user timeline.\n",
