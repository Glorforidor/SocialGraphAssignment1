They were originally the second incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Magneto&#39;s Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Mutants]], but have become completely independent of the other incarnations of that group. They were originally gathered by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=397-398}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fictional team history==\nThe [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] was the founder of the original [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Magneto&#39;s Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. Over the years, the original Brotherhood had disbanded, so Magneto decided to create a new Brotherhood. He recruited five young mutants and trained them to become the new Brotherhood. The five mutants were sent to capture [[Mr. One &amp; Mr. Two|Mister One]], a mutant who was small enough to enter and operate a miniature spacecraft Magneto had discovered. Their plans were foiled by [[Captain America]] and Magneto left the team.&lt;ref&gt;Captain America Annual Vol 1 # 4, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTheir next employer, the [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], renamed the team Mutant Force, a name they would commonly be associated with.&lt;ref&gt;Defenders vol 1 # 78, December 1979&lt;/ref&gt; As Mutant Force the team repeatedly came into conflict with the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. During this period they were employed by both the US government and the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]. [[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peeper]], the usual leader, was absent for their first mission with the Secret Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Defenders Vol 1 # 125&lt;/ref&gt; As Secret Empire operatives, they were led by [[Mad Dog (Marvel Comics)|Mad Dog]].\n\nThe [[Red Skull]] offered the team funding and renamed them the Resistants. As the Resistants, the team fought against the [[Registration acts (comics)#Mutant Registration Act|Mutant Registration Act]]. During this time, [[Slither (comics)|Slither]] wasn&#39;t part of the team, but many mutants joined the team including [[Mist Mistress]] and [[Mentallo]] (now calling himself &#39;&#39;Think Tank&#39;&#39;). As the Resistants, the team would fight against several superheroes, including their original enemy Captain America.&lt;ref&gt;Captain America Vol 1 # 343, July 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually most members would leave. Slither rejoined and the team retook the name Mutant Force.&lt;ref&gt;New Warriors Vol 2 # 6&lt;/ref&gt; The team disbanded shortly afterwards, most members going their own way.\n\nAfter the events of \&quot;[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]\&quot;, some members of the Mutant Force have been depowered while others maintained their mutant abilities.\n\n==Members==\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Burner (comics)|Burner/Crucible]]&#39;&#39;&#39; (Byron Calley): Has the ability to create heat and fire from his hands.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Lifter (comics)|Lifter/Meteorite]]&#39;&#39;&#39; (Ned Lathrop): Can manipulate gravity, increasing his density, durability and strength and negate gravity on other objects, making them fly.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Mist Mistress]]&#39;&#39;&#39;: Can create and control various types of mists like knock-out gas, acidic mists and toxic mists. Depowered. \n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peeper/Occult]]&#39;&#39;&#39; (Peter Quinn): Has increased visual abilities and can fire beams of energy from his eyes. Killed by [[Predator X (comics)|Predator X]].\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Quill (comics)|Quill]]&#39;&#39;&#39;: Body was covered with sharp quills that he could fire at opponents. Depowered.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Rust (comics)|Rust]]&#39;&#39;&#39;: Could fire blasts from his hands that corroded metal. Presumed killed by [[U.S. Agent (comics)|Captain America (Walker)]].\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Randall Darby|Shocker/Paralyzer]]&#39;&#39;&#39; (Randall Darby): Could fire electric blasts from his hands. His hands and feet were cyborg crab-like claws. After the team disbanded, he left for [[Genosha]] to join Magneto. Depowered.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Slither&#39;&#39;&#39; (Aaron Salomon): Has a snake-like body, allowing him to constrict opponents with great force. He also has minor superhuman strength. Slither left when the team became the Resistants, but returned when they became Mutant Force again. Slither was briefly a member of the [[Serpent Society]] on occasion and the Fangs.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Mentallo|Think Tank]]&#39;&#39;&#39; (Marvin Flumm): Better known as the telepath Mentallo. He was only a member of the Resistants for a short time. Currently the Minister of Public Affairs of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]].\n\nThere are also many unnamed members.\n\n==In other media==\nThe Mutant Force appeared in the &#39;&#39;[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Sanctuary.\&quot; They are among the mutants that move to [[Asteroid M]]. The Mutant Force members seen there are [[Lifter (comics)|Lifter]], [[Peepers (Marvel Comics)|Peeper]], [[Randall Darby|Shocker]], and Slither.\n\n==Notes==\n* The original members were all created by [[Jack Kirby]]. [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and [[Mentallo|Think Tank]] were created by [[Stan Lee]] and Jack Kirby. [[Mist Mistress]], [[Quill (comics)|Quill]] and Rust were created by [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Kieron Dwyer]], and [[Al Milgrom]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/mutantforceboem.html Mutant Force] at Marvel Appendix\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/resistants.htm Resistance] at Marvel Appendix\n\n{{Defenders}}\n{{New Warriors}}\n{{Jack Kirby}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Resistants (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillain teams]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]&quot;</span>
