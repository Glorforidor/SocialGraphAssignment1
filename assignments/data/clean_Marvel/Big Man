She was soon joined by a new Crime Master and Sandman.She and her Enforcers were defeated by Spider-Man, the Human Torch and the Sons of the Tiger. Over a dispute about eliminating Spider-Man and the Sons, Janice was killed by the Crime Master who turned out to be her fianc\u00e9 and son of the original Crime-Master, Nick Lewis Jr. (both had separately pursued vengeance against Spider-Man without knowledge of each other's identity).\n\n\n=== Frederick Foswell Jr ===\nFrederick Foswell Jr is the son of the original Big Man, and brother of the second Big Man. He took over the role to gain revenge for the death of his father and sister, which, owing to J. Jonah Jameson's then-hostile attitude towards Spider-Man, he blamed on the webslinger. Piloting a giant robot version of the Big Man, he attacked Spider-Man and Jameson, assuming Jameson would help kill Spider-Man. Spider-Man and the remorseful Jameson quickly defeated Foswell Jr.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n\n=== MC2 ===\nHenry Pym Jr. is the son of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne in the MC2 universe.

He is briefly a member of the Revengers, before going straight and joining a government-sponsored team.\n\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nThe Ultimate Marvel equivalent is named Mr. Big, a mobster and the Enforcers' leader. Mr. Big was scheming to overthrow Wilson Fisk, using Spider-Man as a secret weapon. The plan backfired, and when Fisk learned that he was the one responsible for Spidey's assault on Fisk's office, Fisk crushed the mobster's head bare-handed.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe Big Man codename is depicted in The Spectacular Spider-Man animated series as an alias for a mysterious crime lord who operates from behind the scenes.
