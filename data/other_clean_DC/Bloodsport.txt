=== Robert DuBois ===
First appearing in Superman Vol. 2 #4 (April 1987), an African-American man named Robert DuBois has a mental breakdown and becomes obsessed with the Vietnam War after learning that his brother, Michael aka "Micky", had gone to fight in his place after he became scared, which caused Michael to become a quadruple amputee.An agent of Lex Luthor persuades DuBois that Superman is the enemy and supplies DuBois with a teleporter and various weapons including one that fired bullets made from kryptonite.DuBois adopts the name Bloodsport, rampaging through Metropolis, murdering many in the name of him and his brother, and later injures Superman with the kryptonite bullets before collapsing when confronted by his brother. He is taken back to a psychiatric hospital.Bloodsport appears in JLA/Avengers as a villain who ambushes Vision and Aquaman with a group of other villains. He fights Iron Man and is restrained by Green Lantern.
Bloodsport was killed during a fight with Alex Trent, the second Bloodsport.


=== Alex Trent ===

First appearing in The Adventures of Superman #506, Alex Trent is a fanatical racist, a member of the white supremacist group that Perry White and Franklin Stern encountered when they were younger. He adopts the name Bloodsport, ironically used previously by an African American. He also has a similar teleporter grafted into his body, which he can likewise use to summon weapons. He is captured by Superman after Ron Troupe destroys the warehouse from which he was teleporting his weapons.
Some time later, in an effort to provide an outlet for rising tensions at Stryker's Island Prison, a boxing match between the two Bloodsports is organized. Trent is able to activate his teleporter and bring in weaponry. In the resulting confusion, DuBois is killed while trying to escape.  Trent is later burned in his prison cell by the Brotherhood for showing weakness in front of DuBois.
The teleporter technology has since been used by the anti-corporate vigilante Demolitia.


=== Unnamed ===
A new Bloodsport teamed up with Hellgrammite and Riot, but little has been revealed about him thus far.
Bloodsport is seen among the captured villains in Salvation Run.
