Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in Strange Tales #135 (Aug. 1965), it often deals with paranormal and superhuman threats.\nThe acronym originally stood for Supreme Headquarters, International Espionage and Law-Enforcement Division. It was changed in 1991 to Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate. Within the various films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as multiple animated and live-action television series, the backronym stands for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.The organization has heavily appeared in media adaptations as well as films and shows that take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nS.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s introduction in the Strange Tales featuring \&quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\&quot; occurred during a trend for action series about secret international intelligence agencies with catchy acronyms, such as television&#39;s The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which Stan Lee stated in a 2014 interview, was the basis for him to create the organization. Colonel Fury (initially the lead character of Marvel Comics&#39; World War II series Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos) was reimagined as a slightly older character with an eyepatch (which he lacked in his wartime adventures) and appointed head of the organization. Some characters from the Sgt. Fury series reappeared as agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., most notably Timothy \&quot;Dum-Dum\&quot; Dugan, Fury&#39;s bowler hat\u2013wearing aide-de-camp.Its most persistent enemy is Hydra, a criminal organization founded (after some retcon) by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker.\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D. was presented as an extant, full-blown entity in its first appearance, with Tony Stark in charge of the Special Weaponry section and Fury seeing \&quot;some of the most famous joes from every nation\&quot; (then \&quot;half the leaders of the free world\&quot; a page later) at a meeting of the Supreme International Council. Much was revealed over the years to fill in its labyrinthine organizational history. Stan Lee wrote each story, abetted by artist Kirby&#39;s co-plotting or full plotting, through Strange Tales #152 (Jan. 1967), except for two issues, one scripted by Kirby himself (#148) and one by Dennis O&#39;Neil (#149). Following an issue scripted by Roy Thomas (#153), and one co-written by Thomas and new series artist Jim Steranko, came the sole-writer debut of soon-to-become industry legend Steranko\u2014who had begun on the feature as a penciller-inker of Kirby layouts in #151 (Dec. 1966), taken over the every-other-issue \&quot;Nick Fury\&quot; cover art with #153 two months later, and full writing with #155 (April 1967).\nSteranko quickly established the feature as one of comics history&#39;s most groundbreaking, innovative and acclaimed. Ron Goulart wrote,\n\n[E]ven the dullest of readers could sense that something new was happening. \u2026 Which each passing issue Steranko&#39;s efforts became more and more innovative. Entire pages would be devoted to photocollages of drawings [that] ignored panel boundaries and instead worked together on planes of depth. The first pages \u2026 became incredible production numbers similar in design to the San Francisco rock concert poster of the period.\nLarry Hama said Steranko \&quot;combined the figurative dynamism of Jack Kirby with modern design concepts. The graphic influences of Peter Max, Op Art and Andy Warhol were embedded into the design of the pages \u2014 and the pages were designed as a whole, not just as a series of panels. All this, executed in a crisp, hard-edged style, seething with drama and anatomical tension\&quot;.The series won 1967 and 1968 Alley Awards, and was inducted in the latter year to the awards&#39; Hall of Fame. Steranko himself was inducted into the Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2006. The 12-page feature ran through Strange Tales #168 (sharing that \&quot;split book\&quot; with the occult feature \&quot;Doctor Strange\&quot; each issue), after which it was spun off onto its own series of the same title, running 15 issues (June 1968\u2013Nov. 1969), followed by three all-reprint issues beginning a year later (Nov. 1970\u2013March 1971). Steranko wrote and drew issues #1\u20133 and #5, and drew the covers of #1\u20137.\nNew S.H.I.E.L.D. stories would not appear for nearly two decades after the first solo title. A six-issue miniseries, Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. (June\u2013Nov. 1988) was followed by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.  (vol. 2). This second series lasted 47 issues (Sept. 1989\u2013May 1993); its pivotal story arc was \&quot;the Deltite Affair\&quot;, in which many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were replaced with Life Model Decoy androids in a takeover attempt.\nA year after that series ended, the one-shot Fury (May 1994) retconned the events of those previous two series, recasting them as a series of staged events designed to distract Fury from the resurrection plans of Hydra head von Strucker. The following year, writer Howard Chaykin and penciler Corky Lehmkuhl produced the four-issue miniseries Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (April\u2013July 1995). Various publications have additionally focused on Nick Fury&#39;s solo adventures, such as the graphic novels and one-shots Wolverine/Nick Fury: The Scorpio Connection (1989), Wolverine/Nick Fury: Scorpio Rising (Oct. 1994), Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty and Captain America and Nick Fury: Blood Truce (both Feb. 1995), and Captain America and Nick Fury: The Otherworld War (Oct. 2001).\n\n\n=== Titles ===\n\n\n==== Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. ====\n\nNick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a comic book series published by Marvel Comics, that first premiered in Strange Tales and later became several ongoing series.\n\n\n==== Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. ====\n\nNick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. is a comic book miniseries published by Marvel Comics, that first premiered in 1988.\n\n\n==== Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. ====\n\nFury of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a comic book miniseries published by Marvel Comics, that first premiered in 1995.\n\n\n==== Kitty Pryde, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. ====\n\nKitty Pryde, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a comic book series published by Marvel Comics, that first premiered in 1997.\n\n\n==== S.H.I.E.L.D. ====\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D. is a comic book title published by Marvel Comics.

Later, S.H.I.E.L.D. was depicted as under the jurisdiction of the United Nations, with vast technological resources at its disposal, with U.N. General Assembly Resolutions and legislation passed in signatory nations aiding many of their operations. However, S.H.I.E.L.D. has been inconsistently portrayed as under U.S., rather than U.N., control - for instance, in Astonishing X-Men #3, Nick Fury explains S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s inaction during an incident of genocide by stating that it did not occur on American soil.S.H.I.E.L.D. started off as a top secret international organization (Fury was unaware of them when he was in the CIA) with a Supreme International Council made up of top officials and minds from across the world, including Tony Stark. Its first director was Rick Stoner, former head of the CIA, but he was quickly assassinated by Hydra, and the President of the United States recommended Nick Fury take the role. Later on, the ultimate authority of S.H.I.E.L.D. is revealed to be a cabal of 12 mysterious men and women who give Fury his orders and operational structure, leaving Fury to manage the actual implementation of these orders and stratagems.One of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s unique technological innovations, the LMD (Life Model Decoy) \u2014 an extremely lifelike android used to replace people in imminent danger of being killed \u2014 was the basis for two major upheavals. First, the supervillain Scorpio stole the technology and used it to create the second team of villains called the Zodiac. Later, some LMDs known as the Deltites achieved sentience and infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra both, replacing key members until Fury defeated them. This led to the disbanding of the original organization and its replacement by a new task force with the same acronym under the control of the U.N. (\&quot;Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics Directorate\&quot;) The new S.H.I.E.L.D. was meant to be more streamlined so Fury could personally oversee it, but would soon become a large organization again.\nIn the wake of a disastrous unauthorized mission in Latveria, Fury effectively resigned as executive director, with international warrants out for his arrest. His first successor was not one of his closer associates but a relatively unknown newcomer to the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy, Maria Hill. A transcript of a conversation between Hill and the President of the United States revealed she was chosen for the post by United Nations consensus to keep Fury loyalists out of the job and to keep relations with the superhero community to a minimum. The President also expected Hill \u2014 an American \u2014 to be loyal first to the U.S., despite S.H.I.E.L.D. being a U.N.-chartered organization.The passage of the United States&#39; Superhuman Registration Act and the subsequent superhero \&quot;Civil War\&quot; created an additional political and ethical irritant between S.H.I.E.L.D. and the superhuman community, with S.H.I.E.L.D. tasked to lead enforcement and to take on registered superheroes as operatives.Toward the end of the conflict, Hill concluded she had been made director with the intent that she fail at the job, and she proposes to Tony Stark that he assume the post himself, with her as deputy. Stark accepts the appointment as director upon the conclusion of the superhuman Civil War, and undertakes a series of initiatives, including the construction of a new gold-and-red Helicarrier in the motif of his Iron Man armor designs, the introduction of a daycare center in the Helicarrier, and an employee suggestion-box. While accused of treating S.H.I.E.L.D. as a Stark Industries subsidiary, he succeeded in streamlining the organization and raising morale. S.H.I.E.L.D. fought a wave of global superhuman terrorism and was manipulated into two international incidents that almost saw Director Stark arrested, until they revealed the Mandarin to be behind it and stopped him from committing genocide with an Extremis pathogen.\nAt the start of the Secret Invasion by the extraterrestrial shape-shifting race the Skrulls, the Helicarrier is disabled by a Skrull virus and left floating and disabled in the Bermuda Triangle. The Skrulls by this point have already replaced a large number of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, including the high-ranking Timothy \&quot;Dum-Dum\&quot; Dugan. After the invasion is repelled, the President of the United States decides to dissolve S.H.I.E.L.D., and has it, the Fifty State Initiative, and the Avengers replaced by the Thunderbolts Initiative, which is placed under the supervision of Norman Osborn.Osborn uses the opportunity to transform S.H.I.E.L.D. into a new organization called \&quot;H.A.M.M.E.R.\&quot;, formed by loyal agents of the Thunderbolts Initiative as well as former agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra. The Thunderbolts are officially disbanded in the process as well and turned into a black-ops force that answers only to Osborn. Meanwhile, H.A.M.M.E.R. also operates alongside the newest, and only government-sponsored Avengers team, the Dark Avengers.After the Invasion, Fury discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. itself had been under the control of the terrorist organization Hydra ostensibly from its very beginning.After the conclusion of the Secret Warriors ongoing series, S.H.I.E.L.D. was reformed with Fury leaving it under the control of its new director, Daisy Johnson. The new S.H.I.E.L.D. subsequently saved US Army Ranger Marcus Johnson from mercenaries hired by the Leviathan. When he discovered he was the son of Nick Fury, Marcus (whose birth name was Nick Fury Jr.) and his army friend Phil Coulson joined S.H.I.E.L.D. Maria Hill and the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D. later formed their incarnation of the Secret Avengers.During the Avengers: Standoff! storyline, S.H.I.E.L.D. establishes a gated community called Pleasant Hills to serve as a super villain prison. Using technology derived from the Cosmic Cube called Kobik, S.H.I.E.L.D. converts the inmates into the mild-mannered residents of Pleasant Hills.\n\n\n=== Organizational structure and procedure ===\nOver the decades, various writers have depicted S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s organizational structure in several different ways. The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe (first edition) describes an eight-level ranking structure (technician, administrator, field agent, regional officer, special officer, regional director, special director, executive director), although providing almost no detail on other aspects of the Directorate&#39;s internal makeup. Years later, the miniseries Agents of Atlas mentioned a position of \&quot;sub director\&quot;, and seemed to indicate that the administrative department of S.H.I.E.L.D. it itself referred to simply as \&quot;Directorate\&quot;.\nMost of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s agents are normal humans. At one point the organization attempted to set up a team of superhuman agents, composed of Marvel Man (the future Quasar), Texas Twister, Blue Streak and the Vamp but the latter two were secretly agents of the criminal organization The Corporation, and the team broke apart before it had its first official mission. A second team organized years later also lasted only a short while.\nS.H.I.E.L.D. does employ some superhumans, including in its Psi-Division, composed of telepathic agents who deal with like menaces. S.H.I.E.L.D. also obtains help from independent heroes when their special abilities are needed. It has also accepted some superheroes and supervillains as members, but not in a separate unit. (See \&quot;Membership\&quot;)\nIts headquarters is the Helicarrier, a massive flying aircraft carrier kept airborne at all times and, among other things, containing a squadron of jet fighters and housing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). In addition, S.H.I.E.L.D. maintains strong ties to the superhero community, especially Captain America, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four, and often calls upon that community for aid on particular missions.\nIn the 2000s, depictions of S.H.I.E.L.D. imply a hierarchy of security clearance levels used either in place of, or alongside, the previously described rank structure. The security-clearance hierarchy operates on a scale ranging from \&quot;Level One\&quot;, the lowest, to \&quot;Level Ten\&quot;, described by Maria Hill, executive director at the time, as the highest security clearance anyone of any government can have. Hill&#39;s own clearance, cited in the New Avengers ongoing series, was Level Eight.\n\n\n=== Prominent members ===\n\nThroughout its existence, S.H.I.E.L.D. has been most prominently led by Nick Fury, with Maria Hill succeeding him in mid-2000s stories. She voluntarily stepped down in a 2007 story, becoming deputy director to Tony Stark. Other historically prominent members, who have appeared from the earliest stories to the modern day, include Thaddeus \&quot;Dum Dum\&quot; Dugan and Gabriel \&quot;Gabe\&quot; Jones, both veterans of Fury&#39;s World War II Howling Commandos, though their youthful longevity has not, unlike Fury&#39;s, been explained in Marvel continuity; Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine; Clay Quartermain (Agent 9); Jasper Sitwell (Agent 12); and Sharon Carter (Agent 13), all introduced in the 1960s; and Jimmy Woo, introduced in the 1950s comic Yellow Claw and reintroduced in the &#39; 60s.\nPrior to the events of the Civil War, Captain America estimated there to be 3,000 agents on active duty.\n\n\n=== Bases of operation ===\nAlthough the various Helicarriers built over the years have long been considered S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s primary mobile home base, the Directorate also maintains a number of land bases throughout the world, most notably \&quot;S.H.I.E.L.D. Central\&quot; in New York City. While some of these bases are publicly accessible on a limited basis, most are not publicly disclosed for reasons of planetary security. There are several fully equipped S.H.I.E.L.D. fall-out shelters scattered around the world, with twenty-eight of these being known only to Nick Fury. During the events of Civil War, Nick Fury was hiding in an American-based shelter. He also divulged the location of one to Captain America, so the Resistance to the Superhuman Registration Act could use it as a safe house.\n\n\n== Related organizations ==\nThe following organizations are related to S.H.I.E.L.D.:\n\n\n=== A.R.M.O.R. ===\nA.R.M.O.R. (Altered-Reality Monitoring and Operational Response Agency) is a sister agency to S.H.I.E.L.D. that monitors alternate reality incursions into Earth-616. It was introduced in the Marvel Zombies 3 limited series, written by Fred Van Lente. Van Lente stated that A.R.M.O.R. \&quot;has existed with them this whole time, but it&#39;s been so incredibly secret that no one at Marvel knew about it\&quot;. In the comics it is stated that A.R.M.O.R. is so secret that it &#39;makes S.W.O.R.D. look like S.H.I.E.L.D., and S.H.I.E.L.D. look like the Post Office&#39;. During Dark Reign, A.R.M.O.R. operates under the oversight of H.A.M.M.E.R. but Osborn wanted to fully absorb A.R.M.O.R. into H.A.M.M.E.R. They were able to keep out of Osborn&#39;s clutches when their newest agent, Lyra downloaded incriminating evidence against him.\n\n\n=== H.A.M.M.E.R. ===\n\nH.A.M.M.E.R. replaces S.H.I.E.L.D. after it is dissolved when Norman Osborn is appointed the new head following the conclusion of the Skrull attack. It was not established what H.A.M.M.E.R. stands for; in Dark Avengers #1, Osborn told Victoria Hand, the new Deputy Director, that it does stand for something, and when she asked what it stands for, he told her, \&quot;Get to work on it for me. That is one of the many things on your &#39;To Do&#39; list.\&quot; Former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and members of Hydra are hired as agents. H.A.M.M.E.R. promotes Osborn&#39;s personal team of Avengers, a group composed mostly of former Thunderbolts members and former members of the Mighty Avengers. Osborn also eliminates all of Tony Stark&#39;s influence on S.H.I.E.L.D., including the Cape-Killer Armor and the Red and Gold Helicarrier. He also replaces all agents loyal to Nick Fury, Captain America, or Iron Man with agents loyal to himself. Also, in the Captain America: Reborn Prelude, when Sin, who is captured by H.A.M.M.E.R, asks what it stands for, the agent present says that it&#39;s classified and she does not have security clearance.\n\n\n=== S.P.E.A.R. ===\nS.P.E.A.R.\u2014in the pages of Avengers World\u2014is a Chinese intelligence-gathering organization created for homeland security and has a flying headquarters called the Circle. It was created by the Chinese government to be on the same level as S.H.I.E.L.D. following Thanos&#39; invasion of Earth. Falcon first encountered S.P.E.A.R. and their director Xian Zheng at the time when Gorgon planned to launch an attack on China using the giant dragon whose head is where Madripoor grows out of. When the Hand attacked the Circle, they deployed their own superhuman response team called the Ascendants which consists of Devastator III, Monkey King, Sabre III, Vector II, and Weather Witch.\n\n\n=== S.T.R.I.K.E. ===\n\nS.T.R.I.K.E. (Special Tactical Response for International Key Emergencies) was a British agency, unrelated to but run along similar lines to S.H.I.E.L.D. Disbanded after being infiltrated and taken over by a criminal organization, one of its members was the future X-Man Psylocke. It was introduced in Marvel UK&#39;s Captain Britain #17 (Feb. 2, 1977).\n\n\n=== EuroM.I.N.D. and S.H.A.P.E. ===\nEuroM.I.N.D. (European Monitoring Investigation and Enforcement Division) is a European subdivision of S.H.I.E.L.D. that later fell under the control of the S.H.A.P.E. (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe) council. EuroM.I.N.D.&#39;s director is Fran\u00e7ois Borillon. Its agents include the science reconnaissance group Eurolab and the combat specialist Task Force group, who both then merged into one group known as Euroforce.\n\n\n=== S.T.A.K.E. ===\n\nS.T.A.K.E. (Special Threat Assessment for Known Extranormalities) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. subsidiary that specializes in dealing with supernatural occurrences.\n\n\n=== S.W.O.R.D. ===\n\nS.W.O.R.D. (Sentient World Observation and Response Department), works with S.H.I.E.L.D. but specializes in extraterrestrial threats. It is first introduced in Astonishing X-Men (vol. 3) #6 (Dec. 2004), written by Joss Whedon. Dialogue in the stories depicting both organizations has been ambiguous on whether S.W.O.R.D. is a branch of S.H.I.E.L.D. or a sister agency.\nAgent Abigail Brand, the S.W.O.R.D. agent the X-Men encountered, has green hair, a trait typical of agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s archenemy, Hydra. This unusual characteristic did not go unremarked; Wolverine referred to her as \&quot;Hydra-Hair\&quot; in Astonishing X-Men (vol. 3) #6.\nA similar group as S.W.O.R.D., likewise affiliated with the U.N., is Starcore, which has worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. on several projects of joint interest, including establishing and maintaining a crewed facility on Earth&#39;s Moon.\n\n\n=== W.A.N.D. ===\nW.A.N.D. (Wizardry, Alchemy and Necromancy Department) is a division of S.H.I.E.L.D that specializes in matters relating to magic. It is directed by Pandora Peters. First appearing in Thunderbolts Annual Vol.2 (2014), in which the Thunderbolts are recruited to assassinate Doctor Strange, who is eventually revealed as a faerie impostor called King Oberoth M&#39;gozz.\n\n\n=== ORCHIS ===\nOrchis is an organization dedicated to stop the rapid rise of the mutant population and prevent humanity&#39;s impending extinction scenario with their theory that humans only have a limited number of years left before they become an endangered species. Formed by a human coalition of former scientists and espionage agents from the ranks of S.H.I.E.L.D., S.T.R.I.K.E., S.W.O.R.D., A.R.M.O.R., A.I.M., Alpha Flight, H.A.M.M.E.R., HYDRA and even aspects of Damage Control, this organization truly believes itself as the only hope humanity has to keep mutants from ascending to control of the Earth within the next few generations. That belief has allowed Orchis to salvage the remains of Sol&#39;s Hammer and retrofit it into the Orchis Forge, a site for the creation of a Mother Mold. A strike force of X-Men led by Cyclops successfully destroyed the Mother Mold, which was believed to be the site of the creation of Nimrod, with heavy casualties on both sides.\n\n\n== Alternative versions of S.H.I.E.L.D. ==\n\n\n=== Amalgam Comics ===\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate) is the Amalgam Comics equivalent of S.H.I.E.L.D. from Marvel Comics. They first appeared in Bruce Wayne Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. #1, though in Amalgam continuity, they first appeared in the metafictional Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. strip. S.H.I.E.L.D. was first created by Nick Fury and Sgt. Rock after World War II in order to tackle the danger posed by Hydra. Both founders later trained and recruited Bruce Wayne into their ranks, who would become the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nMembersMembers of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the Amalgam universe include:\n\nMoonwing, a superheroic agent\nTony Stark, disabled and bound to a wheelchair\nSgt. Rock, former leader\nNick Fury, former leader\nSue \&quot;Ace\&quot; Storm of the Challengers of the Fantastic\n\n\n=== House of M ===\nIn an alternate reality where mutants rule over humans, S.H.I.E.L.D. was staffed completely with mutants, all serving the House of Magnus on Genosha. Sebastian Shaw is the Executive Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Wolverine is in charge of the House of Magnus&#39; Red Guard (Agents Rogue, Jessica Drew, Kurt Wagner, Mortimer Toynbee, and Raven Darkholme) and the Marauders are S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s black ops unit.\n\n\n=== Mutant X ===\nS.H.I.E.L.D. was mentioned briefly in the Mutant X alternate universe series as a murderous anti-mutant group. S.H.I.E.L.D. stood for Saviours of Humanity by Intervention in the Evolution of Life-form Deviants. Their story is elaborated on later as one of their own gains powers.\n\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nS.H.I.E.L.D. in the Ultimate Marvel parallel universe was first led by General \&quot;Thunderbolt\&quot; Ross. During the Gulf War, the Weapon X Project, headed by Colonel John Wraith, was sanctioned by S.H.I.E.L.D. and resulted in the creation of Wolverine.\nAfter Ross stepped down and retired, Nick Fury was then selected as the organization&#39;s executive director. His first actions were to shut down Weapon X and resurrect the Super Soldier program, commissioning Richard Parker, Dr. Bruce Banner, Franklin Storm, and young intern Hank Pym to try to recreate the formula that made Captain America. This failed and resulted in the creation of the Hulk when Banner injected his serum into himself. It was later revealed that the chemical called Oz, which turned Norman Osborn into the Green Goblin, was also created in hopes of recreating the Super Soldier formula. Spider-Man was also a product of the Oz formula. Also, the creation of the supervillains Sandman and Electro are due to Hammer Industries attempting to recreate the Super Soldier formula for S.H.I.E.L.D. Then S.H.I.E.L.D. created its own superhero team, the Ultimates. Later still, it brought the X-Men and Spider-Man under S.H.I.E.L.D. jurisdiction. In Ultimate X-Men #65 (Jan. 2006), S.H.I.E.L.D. severed ties with the X-Men. After the events of Ultimate Power, S.H.I.E.L.D. is under the directorship of Carol Danvers, as Nick Fury was temporarily stranded in the Supreme Power Universe. After \&quot;Ultimatum\&quot;, Nick Fury becomes head of the Black-Ops division in Ultimate Comics: Avengers. It is also revealed he is plotting to take back his position as director. After a mysterious force frames Danvers for selling super-soldiers to rival nations, it was revealed to be a ploy by Gregory Stark to become Director, until Fury, the Avengers, and Ultimates stop him, resulting in Thor electrocuting Dr. Stark to death. After the Death of Spider-Man, Marvin Flumm was promoted to Director by the U.S. President. After an arc called \&quot;Divided We Stand\&quot;, a crossover involving Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, Ultimate Comics: X-Men, and Ultimate Comics: Ultimates, Monica Chang (one of Nick Fury&#39;s ex-wives and 2nd Black Widow) was promoted by Captain America to Director after Agent Flumm was dismissed. S.H.I.E.L.D. is later disassembled after the events of Cataclysm, for although the Ultimates were able to defeat Galactus, the destruction caused by Galactus&#39;s attack and the loss of Captain America and Thor make it the last straw for the United States Government, who immediately decide to shut S.H.I.E.L.D. down, resulting in villains such as Norman Osborn (Green Goblin) and Victor Van Damme (Doctor Doom), who are revealed to be alive, being released into the custody of other federal agencies.In the Ultimate Marvel universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. is controlled entirely by the United States, but maintains ties with the European Defense Initiative and the British-operated S.T.R.I.K.E.\n\nMembers\nDivisionsPsi\nBlack-Ops\nEye\nCombat-Unit\n\n\n=== S.A.F.E. ===\nS.A.F.E. (Strategic Action For Emergencies)\u2014introduced in Marvel&#39;s line of novels in the mid-1990s\u2014is the United States&#39; answer to S.H.I.E.L.D. It first appeared in Spider-Man &amp; the Incredible Hulk: Rampage (Doom&#39;s Day Book 1), and may not be part of comics canon, although the novels it appears in have been referred to several times in Marvel&#39;s Handbooks. Whereas S.H.I.E.L.D. is a U.N.-chartered organization dealing with international incidents, S.A.F.E. is tasked with similar duties inside America&#39;s borders. It is run by Colonel Sean Morgan. A prominently featured agent is Joshua Ballard, who, among other things, survived an encounter with Doctor Doom and later Baron Zemo.\nIn the novel Secret of the Sinister Six, S.A.F.E. agent Clyde Fury (no relation to Nick Fury) distinguishes between espionage agencies (such as S.H.I.E.L.D.) and strategic action specialists such as S.A.F.E.\n\n\n=== H.A.T.E. ===\n\nH.A.T.E. (Highest Anti Terrorism Effort) is a parody of S.H.I.E.L.D. created for Marvel Comics&#39; 12-issue series Nextwave by comics author Warren Ellis. The leader of H.A.T.E., General Dirk Anger is a parody of Nick Fury.

Jackson, who says he wants to talk to him about the \&quot;Avengers Initiative\&quot;.\nS.H.I.E.L.D. is briefly referenced in The Incredible Hulk when it is shown that S.H.I.E.L.D. was aware of the experiment on which Dr. Bruce Banner was working about making humans immune to gamma radiation.

Occasionally, these translations will show S.H.I.E.L.D. with an altered name.\nIn the case of selected French editions, the name of the agency was depicted as S.E.R.V.O., which sounds like \&quot;brain\&quot; (cerveau) in French. In later editions, S.H.I.E.L.D is maintained, with the acronym translated as Strat\u00e9gie, Habilit\u00e9, Intervention, Ex\u00e9cution et Logistique D\u00e9fensive (Strategy, Empowered, Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Defensive).In Finnish the name that applies to S.H.I.E.L.D. in mainstream Marvel continuity is Y.P.K.V.V. (Ylimm\u00e4isen P\u00e4\u00e4majan Kansainv\u00e4lisen Vakoilun Vastustamisjaos), a direct translation of the original English. In translations of the Ultimate Marvel comics, the name is K.I.L.P.I., with \&quot;kilpi\&quot; being the translation for the word (as opposed to the acronym) \&quot;shield\&quot;.In Greek, the organization name is \u0391.\u03a3.\u03a0.\u0399.\u0394.\u0391. (pronounced ASPIDA, meaning \&quot;shield\&quot; in Greek). The initials stand for Supreme Military and Political Foundation of International Counter-espionage (\u0391\u03bd\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf \u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u038a\u03b4\u03c1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1 \u0394\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2).In Portuguese, the name S.H.I.E.L.D. remains, but it is translated as \&quot;Superintend\u00eancia Humana de Interven\u00e7\u00e3o, Espionagem, Log\u00edstica e Dissuas\u00e3o\&quot;, i. e., Human Superintendence for Intervention, Espionage, Logistics and Dissuasion.In Dutch the name S.C.H.I.L.D. (schild = shield) has been used by the publisher Williams, but was dropped by Junior Press in favor of S.H.I.E.L.D.In Mexico, it was translated by La Prensa and later Novedades, as C.I.D.E.L., Centro Internacional De Espionaje Legal (International Center of Legal Espionage), but later Novedades changed the acronym to C.S.E.I., Cuartel Supremo de Espionaje e Inteligencia (Supreme Headquarters of Espionage and Intelligence).In Spain, initial publisher V\u00e9rtice translated S.H.I.E.L.D. as \&quot;Escudo\&quot; (always without a determinant), but never showed the meaning. Later publisher Planeta DeAgostini used the name S.H.I.E.L.D., but translating the acronym as \&quot;Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional para la Ejecuci\u00f3n y el Cumplimiento de la Ley\&quot; (international organisation for implementation and fulfillment of law). It has been suggested, as a joke, that the acronym does not correspond to the meaning because the acronym itself is undercover. Now, Panini translates the acronym as \&quot;Servicio Homologado de Inteligencia, Espionaje, Log\u00edstica y Defensa\&quot; (Accredited Service of Intelligence, Espionage, Logistics, and Defense) to keep the original acronym; being this the name used in the current movies or series.In Danish, S.H.I.E.L.D. was originally known as S.K.J.O.L.D., \&quot;Skjold\&quot; being the Danish word for a shield, though the meaning of the abbreviation would differ.In Russian, S.H.I.E.L.D. is named \u0429.\u0418.\u0422. (pronounced SCHIT; \&quot;shield\&quot; in Russian) or \u0417.\u0410.\u0429.\u0418.\u0422.\u0410. (ZASCHITA, meaning \&quot;protection\&quot;). This name often describes as Sixth Intervention Logistics Agency (\u0428\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430).In Poland, S.H.I.E.L.D. is known as T.A.R.C.Z.A. (\&quot;shield\&quot; in Polish). This name describes as Secret Agency of Anti-terrorist Cybernetics Applications Development (Tajna Agencja Rozwoju Cybernetycznych Zastosowa\u0144 Antyterrorystycznych).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of government agencies in Marvel Comics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nS.H.I.E.L.D. at Marvel Wiki\nS.H.I.E.L.D. at Marvel Appendix\nMarvel Directory: Nick Fury\nDon Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia: Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;</span>
