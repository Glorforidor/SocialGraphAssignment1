They were created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]]. The Faceless Hunters hail from Klaramar, the word Klar-a-mar breaks down into \&quot;clear of imperfection\&quot;. Klar is the [[German language]] term for \&quot;clear\&quot;, and \&quot;mar\&quot; can mean either blemish or imperfection.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Faceless Hunters made three appearances in DC Comics flagship science fiction anthology title, all written by Gardner Fox - &#39;&#39;Strange Adventures&#39;&#39;, in issues #124 (January 1961) with artists Mike Sekowsky and [[Murphy Anderson]], #142 (July 1962) with art by [[Carmine Infantino]] and Murphy Anderson, and #153 (June 1963), with art by [[Gil Kane]] and [[Sid Greene]]. All three stories also featured on the covers of those issues, with art by Murphy Anderson.\n\nSince then they have made few appearances in the DC Universe: as one of &#39;The Forgotten Villains&#39; in &#39;&#39;[[DC Comics Presents]]&#39;&#39; #77 - 78 (January - February 1985), written by [[Marv Wolfman]] and drawn by [[Curt Swan]] and [[Dave Hunt (artist)|Dave Hunt]], briefly in &#39;&#39;[[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]]&#39;&#39; #25 (February 1999) and &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice]]&#39;&#39; #50 (December 2002), in &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern]]&#39;&#39; vol 5 #12 (July 2006) and #15 - 16 (December 2006 - January 2007), written by [[Geoff Johns]], and most recently in &#39;&#39;[[Superman: World of New Krypton]]&#39;&#39; #9 (November 2009).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Strange Adventures===\n[[File:Strange Adventures 142.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Strange Adventures #142, artist [[Murphy Anderson]]]]\n{{main|Strange Adventures}}\nThe Faceless Hunters first come to public attention in 1961 after one of them, &#39;&#39;&#39;Klee Pan&#39;&#39;&#39;, is intercepted trying to steal major world sculptures such as the [[Mount Rushmore]] heads and the [[Easter Island]] statues. [[Oregon]] [[highway patrol|Highway Patrolmen]] Bob Colby and Jim Boone are assigned to Mount Rushmore, and confront Klee Pan, who explains that he &#39;&#39; &#39;comes from Klaramar - a world revolving within an atom on the planet [[Saturn]]&#39; &#39;&#39; and he is looking for a stone face left on Earth millennia ago which can help prevent Saturn exploding. He reveals that an evil Faceless Hunter, &#39;&#39;&#39;Chun Yull&#39;&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref&gt;note: who has a name problem - he is initially called &#39;&#39;&#39;Chan Yull&#39;&#39;&#39; in &#39;&#39;Strange Adventures&#39;&#39; #124, but Chen Yull throughout the rest of the story, Chun Yull in &#39;&#39;Strange Adventures&#39;&#39; #142, and Chan Yull throughout &#39;&#39;Strange Adventures&#39;&#39; #152, then &#39;&#39;&#39;Chun Yull&#39;&#39;&#39; again in &#39;&#39;DC Presents&#39;&#39; #77 - 78 and thereafter&lt;/ref&gt; has planted an &#39;ultimate energy time-bomb&#39; and threatened to detonate it unless he is made supreme ruler, but died giving no clues as to where the face, which can defuse the bomb, was hidden. Boone deduces that the face is on [[The Moon]], and Klee Pan takes Colby and Boone there and then to Saturn - after cutting the face from the Moon&#39;s surface. When the face is destroyed by a trap set by Chun Yull, the patrolmen help reconstruct it (using an [[astronomy]] book Boone happens to have had in the patrol car), disarm the bomb and save the planet. The Faceless Hunters replace the face on the Moon in gratitude, and Klee Pan gives both men telepathic abilities.&lt;ref name=\&quot;autogenerated1961\&quot;&gt;\&quot;The Face Hunter From Saturn\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Strange Adventures&#39;&#39; #124, (January 1961)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHaving in fact teleported himself to Saturn instead of dying, Chun Yull later revives and vows revenge on the patrolmen who had thwarted him, and on Earth. He captures Colby and Boone and builds a new bomb, then teleports them all to Klaramar, where Klee Pan once again foils Chun Yull and returns Colby and Boone to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;The Return of the Faceless Creature\&quot; &#39;&#39;Strange Adventures&#39;&#39; #142 (July 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Chun Yull telepathically commands Colby and Boone to build a machine which increases his size and transports him to Earth again, which he threatens to destroy unless he is made &#39;Earth Citizen Number One&#39;. After the [[United Nations]] comply, he reveals that he lied - Faceless Hunters are unable to destroy a planet unless they are citizens of it. Meanwhile, Colby and Boone manage to beam themselves to Klaramar and Klee Pan saves Earth and again captures Chun Yull.&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Threat of the Faceless Creature\&quot; &#39;&#39;Strange Adventures&#39;&#39; #153 (June 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===DC Comics Presents===\n{{main|DC Comics Presents}}\nAfter this defeat, Chun Yull is imprisoned within inescapable &#39;Spheres of Light&#39;, from which he is almost instantly freed by [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|The Enchantress]] because she needed his space traveling powers; he then travels the stars for over 20 years looking for a sorcerer she wishes to team up with to rule the Universe.

He is returned to captivity back in the 20th century in [[Rip Hunter|Rip Hunter&#39;s]] Time Machine, after being abandoned with the rest of the Forgotten Villains by Kraklow and defeated by [[Animal Man]].&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Millennium Then\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Resurrection Man&#39;&#39; #25 (June 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen months later he is fighting [[Young Justice]] on the island nation of Zandia.&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Fighting Maad pt 4: Mubar\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Young Justice&#39;&#39; #50 (December 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Revenge of the Green Lanterns===\n{{see also|Green Lantern}}\nJust over three years later, three Faceless Hunters working as bounty hunters, including Chun Yull, are hunting Green Lanterns.&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Revenge of the Green Lanterns, part 3\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol 4 #12 (July 2006) &#39;&#39;note: a one panel cameo appearance only in a super-villain crowd scene&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt; They take control of the minds of a number of the [[Global Guardians]] to capture Green Lantern [[Hal Jordan]]; but are mistakenly attacked by a team of [[Rocket Reds]] assuming Green Lantern is with them - thwarting their plans to wipe his memory.&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Wanted: Hal Jordan, Chapter 2\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #15 (December 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===New Krypton===\n{{see also|Superman: World of New Krypton}}\nThe Faceless Hunters later appeared in &#39;&#39;Superman: World of New Krypton&#39;&#39; #9 (November 2009), under the command of [[Jemm|Jemm, Son of Saturn]] who appears to be the [[de facto]] ruler of all three known Saturnian races, including the albino \&quot;Koolars\&quot;, and the yellow skinned \&quot;Faceless Hunters\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090814-dc-november2009-solicits-superman.html |title=Thanksgiving on New Krypton: A November &#39;09 Superman Preview |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n\nThe Klaramarians are normally of sub-atomic size, although they can control this, and are often much taller than humans, with a corresponding increase in strength. They also have access to extremely advanced alien technology. Both Chun Yull and Klee Pan possess great strength and the ability to absorb the material or energetic properties of anything they touch and project those properties explosively. Chun Yull displayed the unique quality of giving himself unaided flight using his abilities while battling Superman.&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;DC Comics Presents\&quot; vol. 1 #78 (February 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMost Klaramarians also appear to be telepaths. Klee Pan demonstrated the ability to grant a limited gift of telepathy to deserving humans.&lt;ref name=\&quot;autogenerated1961\&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===[[JLA/Avengers]]===\nFaceless Hunter is among the mind-controlled villains defending [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]&#39;s stronghold in #4.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The Faceless Hunter appears in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. In this continuity, the Faceless Hunter is a single individual rather than an entire race. In fact, he was a violent outcast of his otherwise-peaceful people. When [[Starro]] comes to invade his planet, the faceless citizens find themselves immune to the Starro parasites. Faceless Hunter strikes a deal with Starro to destroy his own planet in exchange to work as his herald. He then travels to several planets, preparing them for Starro&#39;s destruction, eventually ending up in Earth. He takes down all the superheroes, and prepares to drain the energy for Starro, but is foiled by [[Batman]], [[Booster Gold]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], and [[B&#39;wana Beast]]. The Hunter then kidnaps B&#39;wana Beast, and uses his power to combine all the Starro parasites and form a giant beast capable of destroying planets and draining away energy. Batman then infiltrates his ship, and defeats Faceless Hunter, but is unable to save B&#39;wana Beast from death.\n* A Faceless Hunter leader named [[Jemm]] appears in &#39;&#39;[[Supergirl (2015 TV series)|Supergirl]]&#39;&#39;, in episode \&quot;Human For a Day\&quot;, portrayed by [[Charles Halford]]. In this continuity, the Faceless Hunters are from [[Saturn]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=facelesshunter DCU Guide: Faceless Hunter]\n* [http://www.adamarnold.net/forgottenheroes/wwvillians.html &#39;Vanishing Point&#39;: Forgotten Villains]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070124191333/http://www.adamarnold.net/forgottenheroes/annotations.html  &#39;Vanishing Point&#39;: Forgotten Heroes]\n\n{{Gardner Fox}}\n{{Young Justice}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1961]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:DC Comics telepaths]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gardner Fox]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Sekowsky]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]&quot;</span>
