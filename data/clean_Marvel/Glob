{"batchcomplete":"","query":{"pages":{"7368425":{"pageid":7368425,"ns":0,"title":"Glob (comics)","extract":"Glob is the name of different fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe first Glob debuted in The Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #121 (November 1969), and was created by Roy Thomas and Herb Trimpe. Roy Thomas has stated that the character was a conscious imitation of the Heap. Thomas intended to call the character the Shape, but editor Stan Lee thought that name sounded too feminine, and insisted on the name \"the Glob\".The second Glob debuted in The Incredible Hulk #339 and was created by Tom Field and Gary Barker.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n\n\n=== Joseph \"Joe\" Timms ===\nJoe Timms was born in Miami, Florida. Timms was a petty criminal and an escaped convict who drowned in a swamp bog following his escape after he heard his wife was dying. Timms was transformed by radioactive waste into a strange, slime-like, shambling monster named the Glob, with superhuman strength but with very little intelligence. He menaced Betty Ross, and battled the Hulk. He was destroyed by an experimental anti-radiation fluid in the swamp waters. Shortly thereafter, he was resurrected by the Leader, who sent him against the Hulk again. The Glob was blown into fragments by an explosion.The Glob's brain later reformed into the Golden Brain. It was used as a weapon by Yagzan and the Cult of Entropy, but was lost by the Entropists in an encounter with the Man-Thing. The Golden Brain psionically molded itself into an amnesiac blond-haired man. The man was later captured and mutated by Yagzan into a clay form version of the Glob.  It battled the Man-Thing and was reduced to clay again, which smothered Yagzan, killing him.However, it was later revealed that the Glob had re-formed and had been enslaved by the Collector. It eventually rebelled against him with the assistance of the Hulk and the Man-Thing.The Glob was then taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where it was recruited in that organization's Paranormal Containment Unit.During the \"Avengers: Standoff!\" storyline, the Glob was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\n\n=== Sumner Samuel Beckwith ===\nSumner Samuel Beckwith was a geneticist working for the Pantheon who injected himself with an experimental duplicate of the Super-Soldier Formula that he created himself (after discovering the journals of Ted Sallis, who had become the Man-Thing because of his own research in recreating the formula), which turned out to be defective. He transformed into a light-green semi-humanoid being seemingly composed of bog matter and became the second Glob. It fled to the Florida Everglades, menaced Rick Jones and battled the Hulk, who mistook it for the original Glob. It was incinerated by the Man-Thing's touch after it felt fear.\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nBoth Globs were monstrous creatures that resembled a semi-solid mass of slime and bog-matter, with superhuman strength, stamina and durability, though both were limited in intelligence and reflexes. The Globs' bodies are difficult to harm, due to their semi-solid build that could absorb physical attacks painlessly.\nJoe Timms became the Glob due to exposure to radioactive waste in a swamp bog. As the Golden Brain, he had the ability to materialize a powerful electrically charged duplicate of the Glob and recreate himself as a physically perfect version of his human form.\nSumner Beckwith became the Glob when he was injected with an experimental duplicate of the Super-Soldier Formula. Unlike his predecessor, he did not seem to possess quite enough strength to seriously menace the Hulk, spending most of their brief battle on the receiving end of the damage. Before his transformation, he had earned a Ph.D. in genetics and was a skilled geneticist.\n\n\n== Other characters named Glob ==\nThere have been three other characters known as Glob in the Marvel Universe. These include:\n\nThe Glob, an imaginary flaming monster from Strange Tales #88.\nThe Glop, who was originally known as the Glob in Journey into Mystery #72.\nGlob Herman, a student at the Xavier Institute.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Glob was ranked #31 on a listing of Marvel Comics' monster characters.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGlob (Joseph Timms) at Marvel Wiki\nGlob (Sumner Beckwith) at Marvel Wiki\nGlob (Joseph Timms) at The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe\nGlob (Sumner Beckwith) at The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
