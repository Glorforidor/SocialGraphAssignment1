It first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39; #283 (April 1961), and was created by [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] and [[George Papp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=16207 |title=GCD :: Issue :: Adventure Comics #283 |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was frequently used in the &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; comics before the continuity was [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] in the 1980s, after &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39;, and has appeared occasionally since.\n\n==Fictional history==\n\n===Pre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39;===\nThe Phantom Zone was a \&quot;pocket universe\&quot; discovered by [[Jor-El]] that existed outside the space-time continuum; it was used on the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] as a humane method of imprisoning criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume Three: Superman |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=1-4012-1389-8 |pages=267-270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, criminals were punished by being sealed into capsules and rocketed into orbit in suspended animation with crystals attached to their foreheads to slowly erase their criminal tendencies; Klax-Ar was one criminal who received this punishment but escaped. Gra-Mo was the last to suffer the punishment, for it was then abolished in favor of the Zone.\n\nThe inmates of the Phantom Zone reside in a ghost-like state of existence from which they can observe, but cannot interact with, the regular universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=309-312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates do not age or require sustenance in the Phantom Zone; furthermore, they are telepathic and mutually insubstantial. As such, they were able to survive the destruction of Krypton and focus their attention on Earth, as most of the surviving [[Kryptonian]]s now reside there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wells |first=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1960-64 |date=2015 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490458 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most have a particular grudge against Superman because his father created the method of their damnation, and was often the prosecutor at their trials. When they manage to escape, they usually engage in random destruction, particularly easy for them since, on Earth, each has the same powers as Superman. Nevertheless, Superman periodically released Phantom Zone prisoners whose original sentences had been completed, and most of these went to live in the bottle city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]].\n\nThe sole inmate of the Phantom Zone who was not placed there as punishment for a crime is [[Mon-El]], a [[Daxamite]] who fell victim to [[lead]] poisoning. Superboy was forced to cast him into the Phantom Zone to keep him alive, where he remained until the time of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] when [[Brainiac 5]] created a medication that allowed him to leave safely.\n\n[[Green Lantern]] [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] once experienced an extended and tortuous stay after an explosion of a Green Lantern Power Battery sent him there, until rescued by Superman and Green Lantern [[Hal Jordan]], who had believed him to be dead all that time.\n\n[[Phantom Girl]] can enter or leave the Phantom Zone as she pleases, and once did so to interrogate the prisoners about Jor-El.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Adventure Comics&#39; 1964\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #323 (Aug. 1964)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Superman]] develops communications equipment for the Phantom Zone, like the Zone-o-Phone, and refinements to the projector. In addition, the city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] uses the Phantom Zone regularly, with parole hearings sometimes chaired by [[Superman]]. However, since the departure of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], that is, outside of [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]], most of the inhabitants were confined to lifers and generally not inclined to making conversation with their jailer. As for Superman himself, as much as he appreciates how the Zone is necessary to contain its Kryptonian inmates and shelter Mon-El, he apparently privately harbors concerns about the justness of its penal use. This is illustrated in the acclaimed story, \&quot;[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]\&quot; by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], where Clark is ensnared in a fantasy illusion created by an alien parasitical plant called a [[Black Mercy]]. As his subconscious resists the illusion of a peaceful life on Krypton, among the first signs of its degeneration is the sight of his cousin, [[Kara Zor-El]], hospitalized after being attacked by an anti-Phantom Zone militant who left literature protesting that the Phantom Zone is a method of torture.\n\nIn the [[Steve Gerber]] miniseries &#39;&#39;The Phantom Zone&#39;&#39; #1-4 (January\u2013April 1982), it is revealed that the Zone not only has a breach through which other inmates had escaped, but that they were never heard from again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imprisoned Superman and Quex-Ul use this method and travel through several dimensional \&quot;layers\&quot; seeking the exit into the physical universe. They finally encounter a Kryptonian wizard named Thul-Kar, who tells them that he believed Jor-El&#39;s prophecy of Krypton&#39;s doom and entered the Phantom Zone through magic. Using the same breach, he discovered the truth about the Phantom Zone: all its levels are manifestations of the consciousness of a sentient universe called Aethyr. The Zone itself is an interface between the Earth-One dimension and Aethyr&#39;s mind, the outer layer representing its ability for abstract thought; the Zone is basically Aethyr&#39;s capacity to imagine other possibilities of existence. Only by entering Aethyr&#39;s core realm can they escape back to Earth, which is dangerous since any being who tries risks either being destroyed or merging with Aethyr&#39;s essence.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Phantom Zone #3 March 1982\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Phantom Zone&#39;&#39; #3 (March 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; While Quex-Ul is killed by Aethyr, Superman manages to make his way out of the Phantom Zone and return to Earth.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Phantom Zone&#39; 1982\&quot;/&gt;\n\n[[Mister Mxyzptlk]] is later possessed by Aethyr. During Superman&#39;s fight with the possessed Mxyzpltk-Aethyr, he empties the Phantom Zone of its inhabitants but is absorbed into Aethyr itself. As the Phantom Zone villains head to Earth to conquer it, Thul-Kar and Nam-Ek are also absorbed into Aethyr. Superman awakes and sees that the Phantom Zone villains are wreaking havoc on Earth, causing destruction to the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. and demanding Superman come out and fight them. Superman battles the Phantom Zone villains in Washington. While fighting Faora Hu-Ul, he witnesses her disappearing as she is absorbed into Aethyr. Mister Mxyzpltk reveals that his strong personality has taken over Aethyr and he absorbs all the rest of the Phantom Zone inhabitants into himself. Mxyzpltk-Aethyr leaves, intending to next take over the Fifth Dimension, and Superman is left to put out the fires in Washington and then rid Metropolis of Kryptonite.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;DC Comics Presents&#39;&#39; #97&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39;===\n[[File:Phantom Zone Criminals.png|thumb|upright|Phantom Zone criminals pictured from left to right: [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]], [[General Zod]], and [[Non (comics)|Non]].&lt;br&gt;Art by Gary Frank and Jonathan Sibal.]]\nIn the Post-&#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]&#39;&#39; [[DC Universe]], the Phantom Zone first appears after [[Superman]] returns from space with a [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] artifact called the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]. This device, created by his Kryptonian ancestor Kem-L, attempts to recreate Krypton on Earth, building the [[Fortress of Solitude]]; the extradimensional space in which the Eradicator finds the Kryptonian materials necessary is called the Phantom Zone.&lt;ref name=\&quot;adventures460\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic\n | writer = [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]]\n | penciller = Jurgens, Dan\n | inker = [[Andy Kubert|Kubert, Andy]]\n | story = Be It Ever So Deadly\n | title = [[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]\n | issue = #460\n | date = November 1989\n | publisher = DC Comics\n | location = New York\n }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;adventures461\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic\n | writer = [[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]]\n | penciller = Jurgens, Dan\n | inker = [[George P\u00e9rez|Perez, George]]\n | story = Home\n | title = [[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]\n | issue = #461\n | date = December 1989\n | publisher = DC Comics\n | location = New York\n }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Phantom Zone Projector is part of [[Superman]]&#39;s current [[Fortress of Solitude|Fortress]]. It has been used to access the Bottle City of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] and to trap villains such as the [[White Martian]]s.\n\nThe Phantom Zone has been independently discovered by various characters where it is called the \&quot;Buffer Zone\&quot; by the [[Phantom Girl|Bgztlians]], the \&quot;Still Zone\&quot; by the White Martians, the \&quot;Stasis Zone\&quot; by [[Loophole (comics)|Loophole]], the \&quot;Ghost Zone\&quot; by [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]], and the \&quot;Honeycomb\&quot; by the [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]] I. In Post-&#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]&#39;&#39;/Post-&#39;&#39;[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]&#39;&#39; continuity, it was Loophole&#39;s \&quot;Stasis Zone\&quot; technology that exiled [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]], known in the new continuity as Valor/M&#39;Onel, into the Phantom Zone for 1,000 years.\n\n[[Superman]] fashions the Phantom Zone technology into an arrow projectile which upon striking a victim will project them into the Phantom Zone. Roy Harper, the original [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]], steals this arrow from [[Superman]] when the original [[Teen Titans]] are invited for a visit many years ago. Roy, however, never uses the arrow and passes it on to his replacement, [[Mia Dearden]], who uses the arrow during the events of &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; on [[Superboy-Prime]]. Unfortunately, he is too strong for even the Phantom Zone arrow, and manages to break out.\n\nAt one point, the White Martians imprison [[Batman]] in the Phantom Zone and take his identity as Bruce Wayne.\n\nBatman devises a measure made after Superman recovers from his [[The Death of Superman|first battle]] with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], that, when the Justice League or any other superhero groups encounter a Doomsday Level Threat, a group of heroes, authority, and military forces will contain it within a proximity after clearing all civilians within it. If Superman and the rest fall, the Doomsday Protocol will commence by sending it to the Phantom Zone.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #825&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39;, [[General Zod]], along with [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] and [[Non (comics)|Non]], appear in search of the [[Chris Kent (comics)|son of Zod and Ursa]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #845&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&#39;&#39;[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]&#39;&#39; #16 shows a form of life native to the Phantom Zone. These Phantoms are enraged over the use of their universe to house criminals and seek revenge on the one responsible.\n\nDuring the \&quot;New Krypton\&quot; storyline, the Krytonians in Kandor have started to take matters into their own hands and started rounding up some of Superman&#39;s enemies to throw them into the Phantom Zone. First, they attack the Science Police where they make off with the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]]. The second target is [[Silver Banshee]] who the Kandorians chase across the skies. At [[Arkham Asylum]], the Kryptonians knock out [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Tim Drake|Robin]] where they make off with the Toyman while another group knocks out [[Black Lightning]] in order to claim the [[Toyman]]. [[Bizarro]] is even attacked by Thara&#39;s group while flying. While Superman, Supergirl, and Zora are disgusted at what some of the Kandorians did and demands the ones responsible to turn themselves over to the authorities, Alura would not cooperate and gives the orders to throw the villains that they rounded up into the Phantom Zone.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Superman 682\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #682&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were thrown into the Phantom Zone were later freed by Superman.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #684&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the miniseries &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39; the Phantom Zone is ingested by [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mr. Mind]] while he is mutating into a giant insect form. Once full-grown, Mind regurgitates it in an attempt to destroy [[Booster Gold]] and [[Rip Hunter]], but the attack is deflected by [[Supernova (comics)|Supernova]], who returns the Phantom Zone to its proper dimensional plane. Supernova is able to control the Zone as his supersuit&#39;s powers are based upon Phantom Zone projector technology stolen by Rip Hunter.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39; #874, the Phantom Zone vanished.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #874&lt;/ref&gt; &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39; #886 offers a possible explanation as to the Phantom Zone&#39;s disappearance, the theory being that the Phantom Zone was actually the mythical [[Nightwing]], counterpart to the [[Flamebird]], imprisoned in an altered state of being. Having chosen a new Avatar, Chris Kent, who was freed from the Zone, he too would have been freed from his shackles, thus causing the Phantom Zone to cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #886&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #11, the Phantom Zone is recreated by [[Reep Daggle|Chameleon Boy]] and Superman.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #11&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;The New 52&#39;&#39;===\nIn &#39;&#39;[[The New 52]]&#39;&#39;, Jor-El suggests going into the Phantom Zone when Krypton was about to explode. Zod however appears with other Phantom Zone prisoners and attempts to escape the Phantom Zone. Krypto however sacrifices himself by attacking Xa-Du, thus going into the Phantom Zone as well.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #5&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIt is revealed that Doctor Xa-Du was the first Kryptonian prisoner to be sent to the Phantom Zone due to his forbidden experiments in suspended animation, with Jor-El executing the sentence. The Phantom Zone is reverted to the Pre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; version as the inmates can observe, but cannot interact with, the regular universe, becoming literally \&quot;phantoms\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #13&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;DC Rebirth&#39;&#39;===\nDuring the &#39;&#39;Dark Days: Metal&#39;&#39; event of the &#39;&#39;[[DC Rebirth]]&#39;&#39; reboot, Superman has theorized that the Phantom Zone might be actually a permeable membrane between Earth-0 (DC Universe) and the Dark Multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Dark Days&#39;&#39; #3&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Known inmates==\n\n===Inmates in Pre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39;===\nThroughout the [[Silver Age of Comic Books#DC Comics|Silver Age of Comic Books]], the following inhabitants of the Phantom Zone have been depicted.  Based on this list, at least 34 [[Kryptonian]]s were projected into the Phantom Zone on [[Krypton (comics)#Silver Age Krypton|Krypton]] over a period of less than 256 Kryptonian days.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;World Of Krypton&#39;&#39; #2 (Aug. 1979) and #3 (Sept. 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;  Refer to the entry on the [[Kryptonian#Calendar|Kryptonian Calendar]] for details on the relationship between Kryptonian sun-cycles and Earth years.\n\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Ak-Var&#39;&#39;&#39; - Ak-Var was sentenced to approximately 30 Earth years (22 Kryptonian sun-cycles)&lt;ref&gt;30 Kryptonian sun-cycles is impossible given Superman&#39;s time on Earth, thus 30 Earth years must be assumed to be correct; extrapolating from Quex-Ul&#39;s release date in &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #157 (Nov. 1962), a sentence of 19 Kryptonian sun-cycles (26 Earth years) would make more sense.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Phantom Zone for plotting to steal a revered relic called a Sun-Stone from a museum. After he had served his full sentence, Ak-Var was released by [[Superman (Earth-One)|Superman]] and brought to the bottle-city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]]. Ak-Var became the lab assistant of Superman&#39;s cousin, Van-Zee.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #336 (April 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime later, Van-Zee adopted the costumed identity of [[Nightwing#Van-Zee|Nightwing]], and Ak-Var became his partner [[Flamebird#Ak-Var|Flamebird]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman Family&#39;&#39; #183 (Sept.-Oct. 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Ar-Ual&#39;&#39;&#39; - Ar-Ual was sentenced to 50 Kryptonian sun-cycles (68.5 Earth years) in the Phantom Zone for destroying priceless knowledge and depriving Krypton of 1,000 years of scientific progress.  When an alien space warship that was approaching Earth exploded, the blast opened a temporary rift in the Zone. Ar-Ual escaped the Zone, captured and imprisoned [[Wonder Woman#Silver Age|Wonder Woman]], then impersonated her so that she could trick Superman into marriage. Ar-Ual figured that Superman would never suspect his wife of ruling the crime world. Superman uncovered her deception and returned her to the Zone.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&#39;&#39; #93 (July 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Az-Rel&#39;&#39;&#39; - Az-Rel was a petty criminal from Bokos, the Island of Thieves. He possessed [[Pyrokinesis|pyrotic powers]]. His partner, Nadira, possessed [[Telekinesis|psychokinetic powers]].  Together they robbed helpless victims in Erkol, the oldest city of Krypton. Both were captured and sentenced to 15 Kryptonian sun-cycles (20.55 Earth years)&lt;ref&gt;If 15 sun-cycles is correct, Az-Rel should have been released into Kandor long ago.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Phantom Zone. The two criminals were among those freed from the Zone when Quex-Ul was manipulated into building and activating a crude Phantom Zone Projector.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Phantom Zone #1 Jan. 1982\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Phantom Zone&#39;&#39; #1 (Jan. 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Nadira was killed when the dying Jer-Em exposed her to [[Kryptonite#Forms.2C colors and their effects|green kryptonite]].

Bal-Gra once escaped from the Phantom Zone through a temporary space-warp. He boasted to Superman that he was the strongest man on Krypton. [[Lois Lane#Silver Age and Bronze Age|Lois Lane]] managed to expose Bal-Gra to [[Kryptonite#Forms.2C colors and their effects|gold kryptonite]], which permanently robbed him of his superpowers. He was then sent back into the Zone by Lorraine Lewis, a brilliant scientist who had built her own Phantom Zone projector.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #204 (Feb. 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Blak-Du&#39;&#39;&#39; - The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed.

He turned to crime, but made the fatal mistake of impersonating Jor-El and attempting to rob his house. Jor-El returned home too soon and foiled Cha-Mel&#39;s attempt. The young thief was sentenced to the Phantom Zone for his crime. Years later, Cha-Mel managed to take the form of [[Superboy#Kal-El|Superboy]] and trick the real Superboy into entering the Zone. Cha-Mel then manipulated Superboy&#39;s parents into freeing him.  He tried to secure the Phantom Zone projector to free the other prisoners, but the device was destroyed in a tug-of-war with [[Krypto#The original Krypto|Krypto]], returning him to the Phantom Zone while freeing Superboy.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superboy&#39;&#39; #162 (Jan. 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[General Zod#Silver Age|General Dru-Zod (General Zod)]]&#39;&#39;&#39;&lt;ref&gt;Full name given as \&quot;Dru-Zod\&quot; in &#39;&#39;World Of Krypton&#39;&#39; #3 (Sept. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; \u2013 General Zod was sentenced to 40 Kryptonian sun-cycles (54.8 Earth years) for using a duplicator ray to create a private army of imperfect clones ([[Bizarro#Pre-Crisis Bizarro|Bizarros]]) to overthrow the government.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Adventure Comics&#39; 1961\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #283 (April 1961)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Erndine Ze-Da (Zeda)&#39;&#39;&#39;&lt;ref&gt;Last name given as \&quot;Ze-Da\&quot; in &#39;&#39;Phantom Zone&#39;&#39; #1 (Jan. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; - The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed. One day, a South Seas volcano exploded, and the concussion opened a temporary gap in the Phantom Zone, enabling both Erndine Ze-Da and Dr. Xadu to escape.

He was stopped by Jor-El, who had arrived just in time, and was sentenced to the Phantom Zone for his crime. Gazor claimed that he had received the longest sentence ever given to anyone condemned to the Phantom Zone. This contradicts the fact that Jax-Ur and Orn-Zu both received life sentences. However, after Mon-El was released from the Zone in the 30th Century, Gazor was indeed the only prisoner remaining in that ghostly dimension.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Adventure Comics&#39; 1964\&quot;/&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Gor-Nu&#39;&#39;&#39; - Once the greatest [[biochemist]] on Krypton, Gor-Nu&#39;s reckless experiments caused several deaths. He was sentenced to 50 Kryptonian sun-cycles (68.5 Earth years) in the Phantom Zone.  When a lethal crystal-menace threatened to destroy the bottle-city of Kandor, Superman released Gor-Nu in the hope that he could figure out a way to stop it. Gor-Nu was successful, but he then tried to betray Superman.

They were the last criminals to receive this type of punishment. After Krypton&#39;s destruction, the capsule drifted through space, and they eventually awakened and traveled to Earth.  When Superboy learned of their criminal nature, he figured out a way to defeat them and projected them into the Phantom Zone.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superboy&#39;&#39; #104 (April 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;The Inventor&#39;&#39;&#39; - The history and sentencing of this non-Kryptonian prisoner was not revealed.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Adventure Comics&#39; 1970\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #400 (Dec. 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Jackson Porter of Earth&#39;&#39;&#39; - Phantom Zone prisoner Faora Hu-Ul used telepathy to delude Jackson Porter into believing she was the ghost of his dead wife, Katie.

A few years after that, when Supergirl was forced through [[hypnosis]] by the Sisterhood of Evil to test a deadly poison on a super-human, Py-Ron agreed to be her test subject. When Py-Ron appeared to die, Supergirl was then forced to give the poison to Superman and herself. Luckily, [[Comet (DC Comics)#Pre-Crisis Comet|Comet the Super-Horse]] had learned of the poison and altered it with his X-ray vision so that it only put the victims into suspended animation for a few hours. When Py-Ron woke up, he tried to earn his right to stay out of the Zone by flying to Feminax, the Sisterhood&#39;s homeworld, and killing everyone in retaliation.

After countless failures, Shyla predicted that she could use her mental powers to manipulate a jet pilot into flying his plane in a specific manner which would create a rip in the Zone. She escaped from her prison and battled Supergirl. When Shyla attempted to use the Phantom Zone Projector in Superman&#39;s [[Fortress of Solitude#Original version|Fortress of Solitude]] to free the other Phantom Zone prisoners, Supergirl was able to project her back into the Zone.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman Family&#39;&#39; #183 (May\u2013June 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; A short time later, Shyla was freed in the bottle-city of Kandor, where she attempted to get her revenge on Supergirl.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman Family&#39;&#39; #188 (March 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Tal-Var of the Dark Dimension&#39;&#39;&#39; - Jimmy Olsen accidentally released the evil Tal-Var from the Dark Dimension.

Years later, he instructed a group of Phantom Zone prisoners to use their combined mental powers to prompt the Mayor of Midvale to ask Supergirl to perform a feat which would open a small rift in the Zone. The handsome Tor-An escaped and tricked Supergirl into marrying him. When he began to gloat that she would now be forever disgraced, he learned to his dismay that the marriage was invalid and that he himself had been tricked by Supergirl. He was quickly captured and returned to his prison.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #307 (Dec. 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;The Toymaster&#39;&#39;&#39; - The history and sentencing of this non-Kryptonian prisoner was not revealed.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Adventure Comics&#39; 1970\&quot;/&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Tra-Gob&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2013 Tra-Gob was the leader of a band of Kryptonian thieves which raided the priceless Science Archives. He was betrayed by his own men, but was rescued by Jor-El before they could exterminate him. Tra-Gob was sentenced to nearly 40 Earth years (29 Kryptonian sun-cycles) for his crime, but still remained deeply grateful to Jor-El. Tra-Gob was in the Phantom Zone for nearly 30 Earth years&lt;ref&gt;30 Kryptonian sun-cycles is impossible given Superman&#39;s time on Earth, thus 30 Earth years must be assumed to be correct.&lt;/ref&gt; before he escaped due to a freak disruption by the [[Aurora|aurora borealis]]. He rescued Superman and Lois Lane from a Kryptonian monster, repaying his debt to Jor-El. As Tra-Gob was being returned to the Zone to finish out his sentence, Superman commented that he may be [[pardon]]ed in Kandor for his good behavior.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&#39;&#39; #98 (Jan. 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Tyb-Ol&#39;&#39;&#39; - The history and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Action Comics #548 Oct 1983\&quot;/&gt; Tyb-Ol was among a group of Phantom Zone prisoners who escaped by focusing their mental energies on a piece of jewel kryptonite.

During a parole hearing in Kandor, Vorb-Un explained to Superman and the parole board that his sentence was almost up, and he insisted that he had repented. Due to his advanced age and his sincere remorse, he was released from his prison.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #310 (March 1964)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Vor-Kil&#39;&#39;&#39; - The crime and sentencing of this prisoner was not revealed. Vor-Kil escaped from the Phantom Zone when [[sunspot]] activity opened a temporary gap to Earth. He battled Superman using the Kryptonian martial art of Klurkor.

As part of his plan to escape the Zone and trap Superboy there, Zan-Em mentally manipulated Lester Wallace into developing a hatred of aliens. When Lester projected Superboy into the Zone, Zan-Em remarked that he had been in the prison dimension for nearly two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Since Superboy is nearly 16 years old in this story, Zan-Em would have been sent to the Zone somewhere between 13.8 and 14.8 Earth years prior, thus he must be referring to Earth decades.&lt;/ref&gt; Superboy escaped the Zone, leaving Zan-Em trapped in his prison.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #458 (July-Aug. 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Zo-Mar&#39;&#39;&#39; - The criminal Zo-Mar was captured, sentenced to life for attempting to enslave all of Krypton, placed in suspended animation, and imprisoned in a space capsule which was placed into orbit around Krypton.

With the help of the [[Challengers of the Unknown]], Superman captured Zo-Mar and projected him into the Phantom Zone.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;DC Comics Presents&#39;&#39; #84 (Aug. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Unnamed Kandorian scientist&#39;&#39;&#39; - A scientist in Kandor was sentenced to 20 Kryptonian sun-cycles (27.4 Earth years) for performing experiments with the Z-Bomb, even though he was warned that it could accidentally blow up the bottle-city.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #279 (Aug. 1961)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Unnamed energy creature&#39;&#39;&#39; - An alien life form whose race evolved into [[Energy being|pure energy]] followed an Earth probe back to Earth.

The judges reason that even if Superman feels that he may have killed his foe deliberately after the deaths of his family and friends, putting him in a conventional prison without his powers would be dangerous and solitary confinement was too extreme given his past deeds, selecting the Zone based on the suggestion of the new [[Batman]], Bruce Wayne Junior. Superman is released in 1999 by the now-rejuvenated Bruce Wayne as Bruce returns to the role of Batman-Bruce noting that he is ending the sentence a few months early but is certain that nobody would object to early release \&quot;for good behavior\&quot;-although Superman was briefly able to appear as a phantom in the real world in 1997 to distract a foe who was about to kill Knightwing (Superman&#39;s grandson, adopted by Batman&#39;s son after the deaths of Superman&#39;s children).\n\n==In other media==\n{{Long plot|section|plural=yes|date=June 2019}}\n===Television===\n* In the 1978 season of &#39;&#39;[[Super Friends]]&#39;&#39; there is an episode titled \&quot;Terror from the Phantom Zone\&quot; in which a comet&#39;s collision causes the Phantom Zone to release three Kryptonian villains Hul (voiced by [[Stan Jones (actor)|Stanley Jones]]), Rom-Lok (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]), and Logar (voiced by [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]]) who are exclusive to this series. The villains go on a crime spree and banish the Super Friends to the Phantom Zone, but keep Superman on Earth where they exposed him to red kryptonite which causes him to age quickly, though the red kryptonite also gave Rom-Lok an appearance that resembles [[Shaggy Man (comics)|Shaggy Man]]. The villains get great enjoyment showing off \&quot;old Superman\&quot; to the world. Superman, with help from the Justice League computer, manages to figure out that blue kryptonite may reverse the aging process because blue kryptonite is harmful to [[Bizarro]] and therefore should be helpful to Superman. Superman finds the blue kryptonite and is aged back to normal, then goes on his quest to rescue the other Super Friends and ultimately send the three villains back into the Phantom Zone. The three villains later return in a \&quot;lost season\&quot; episode from 1983 titled \&quot;Return of the Phantoms\&quot;. Here, they hijack an alien&#39;s time-space conveyor and go back in time to Smallville and attack [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]], in order to prevent him from becoming Superman. Fortunately, the pilot of that craft went to warn the Super Friends about what the trio would be attempting, and guided Superman and Green Lantern to the proper time period to help the boy. The &#39;&#39;Super Friends&#39;&#39; version of the Phantom Zone is described as, \&quot;&#39;&#39;Far beyond the boundaries of the [[Milky Way Galaxy|Milky Way]]. In the uncharted void of deep space. An incredible 5th dimension of space and time, lies parallel to the universe that we know. This interesting interstellar warp which holds the most sinister and ruthless criminals in the galaxy is the infamous Phantom Zone&#39;&#39;\&quot;. The molecular structure of any person exiled in the Zone appears white and black. Batman&#39;s devices and the [[Wonder Twins]]&#39; Exxor Powers are useless within the Phantom Zone.\n* The Phantom Zone appears in the &#39;&#39;[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;The Hunter\&quot;. General Zod and his female followers Ursa and Faora are shown as prisoners in the Phantom Zone.\n* Although the Phantom Zone is not explicitly mentioned or shown in &#39;&#39;[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]&#39;&#39;, there is a similar type of medium which resembles its representation in season four episodes \&quot;Meet John Doe\&quot; and \&quot;Lois and Clarks\&quot;. An Utopian from the future Andrus programmed a \&quot;time tablet\&quot; to trap fugitive Tempus in a space-time cube if he tried to control the tablet. However, Tempus tricked Superman into being trapped in the cube, which was then lost in space-time. Superman was rescued by [[H.G. Wells]] when the exact second Clark who disappeared was discovered. Another episode from that season \&quot;Battleground Earth\&quot; featured another analogue, a Kryptonian form of capital punishment (practiced by a surviving colony); devices capable of scattering a criminal&#39;s body across the universe. Superman was sentenced to this punishment, but due to newly discovered facts and a violation of procedure the process was reversed before it could be completed. It is unclear whether a fully complete procedure could be reversed, and if so, whether there is a point after which it becomes irreversible. Superman was feeling shaky immediately after the procedure (which appeared to be painful), but recovered quickly.\n* The Phantom Zone is first mentioned in the first episode of &#39;&#39;[[Superman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39;, \&quot;The Last Son of Krypton, Part 1\&quot;. [[Jor-El]] attempted to convince everyone to enter the Phantom Zone to be saved from [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]&#39;s destruction, and one man would be sent via [[starship|spaceship]] to re-establish Krypton&#39;s population on a new world. Since this idea was not accepted by Krypton&#39;s Science Council, Jor-El sent his son in the spaceship to [[Earth]] along with the Phantom Zone projector. In the episode \&quot;Blasts from the Past\&quot;, [[Superman]] discovers the Phantom Zone projector which also has a communication function that allows him to converse with the inmates. He makes contact with the convicted traitor [[Mala (Kryptonian)|Mala]] (who is a loose adaptation of &#39;&#39;[[Superman II]]&#39;&#39;&#39;s [[Ursa (villain)|Ursa]]). He learns that Mala&#39;s 20-year sentence in the Phantom Zone is finished and releases her. He hoped to train Mala as his co-worker. Unfortunately, Superman then learns that Mala is arrogant and power-hungry, badly enough to possibly require returning her to the Phantom Zone. When she learns that Kal-El (Superman&#39;s Kryptonian name) prefers the company of a certain terrestrial named [[Lois Lane]], Mala turns against [[Superman]], and later releases General [[Jax-Ur]] (a version of [[General Zod]], although named after another villain from the [[Superman]] comics) to take over Earth. They were banished once again into the Phantom Zone at the end of the story as Superman commented \&quot;Parole revoked\&quot;. In \&quot;Absolute Power\&quot;, Jax-Ur and Mala are later accidentally released on another remote planet where they remake it into Krypton&#39;s image. During a fight with the Kryptonian fleet, Jax-Ur and Mala are ultimately sent into a [[black hole]].\n* In the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;The Doomsday Sanction\&quot;, Superman and the [[Justice League]] send the nearly unstoppable [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] into the Phantom Zone after his capture. This usage of the Phantom Zone, effectively sentencing Doomsday to life imprisonment without trial, presented massive arguments about the Justice League&#39;s right to make such judgments. [[Batman]] was especially troubled by this move because their verdict on Doomsday would have been a decision that the [[Justice Lords]] would have made.\n* In the &#39;&#39;[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]&#39;&#39; animated series, the Phantom Zone is close to its classical portrayal as a parallel dimension where criminals are sent. As a throwback to the Pre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; version, inhabitants of the Zone become incorporeal - essentially, ghost-like phantoms - thus giving the Zone its name. In this series, [[Superman]] discovers his previous self&#39;s Phantom Zone projector, which he accidentally uses to free a villain named Drax (voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]). The projector is eventually turned on the other Legionnaires, but with [[Phantom Girl]]&#39;s help, they manage to escape without it and send Drax back at the same time. On a related note, Drax mentioned that he was born in the Phantom Zone.\n* In the [[television series]] &#39;&#39;[[Smallville]]&#39;&#39;, in the 5th-season premiere \&quot;[[Smallville Season 5|Arrival]]\&quot;, Clark Kent battles two evil [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonians]] named Nam-Ek &amp; Aethyr (Disciples of Zod). When he refuses to join them in their quest to subjugate Earth, the [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonians]] attempt to banish Clark to the Phantom Zone using a metallic bracelet (inscribed with [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] symbols) that opens up a vortex. However, Clark manages to turn the tables, sending them into the portal instead. Aside from its entrance, the Phantom Zone is represented as a floating black square, similar to its depiction in the &#39;&#39;[[Superman]]&#39;&#39; films. In the episode \&quot;[[Smallville Season 5|Solitude]]\&quot;, the Kryptonian [[artificial intelligence]] known as [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] (posing as Professor Milton Fine) manipulates Clark into believing that Jor-El is responsible for Martha&#39;s mysterious illness. This is all part of a plot to free the imprisoned General Zod. Professor Fine persuades Clark to take him to the [[Fortress of Solitude]], where he gives Clark a black crystal and instructs him to insert it into the Fortress&#39; control console, misleadingly saying that it will destroy Jor-El and therefore save Martha. However, the crystal, once inserted into the console, instead opens up a vortex in which another black square is seen, with a figure resembling General Zod as portrayed in the &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; movies. However, Brainiac&#39;s plan is thwarted once Clark removes the crystal. In the episode \&quot;[[Smallville Season 5|Vessel]]\&quot;, General Zod is finally freed from the Phantom Zone. After inhabiting [[Lex Luthor]], Zod traps Clark inside the Phantom Zone using a Kryptonian bracelet similar to the one used in the episode \&quot;Arrival\&quot;. In the season premiere of the 6th season, the Phantom Zone itself is shown as a desolate wasteland where Clark is rendered powerless and mortal. It is revealed to have been created by Jor-El as a prison for not only Kryptonian convicts, but also criminals from the \&quot;28 known galaxies\&quot;. The more dangerous prisoners (e.g. General Zod and Bizarro) are stripped of their corporeal forms and their spirits are then cast into the Zone. Clark escapes with the help of a Kryptonian woman named [[Raya (Smallville)|Raya]], who claims to have known Jor-El. To ensure her survival, Jor-El sent Raya to the Phantom Zone just before the destruction of Krypton. Raya reveals that those of the blood of Jor-El&#39;s house can utilize a secret exit from the Phantom Zone, therefore Clark can leave. Upon escaping the Phantom Zone, Clark accidentally releases Raya and various prisoners and phantoms to Earth. [[Chloe Sullivan]] later refers to the escaped convicts as \&quot;Zoners\&quot;. In the season 7 finale, \&quot;[[Smallville Season 7|Arctic]]\&quot;, it is revealed that Brainiac has trapped Kara in the Phantom Zone. In the season eight episode \&quot;[[Smallville Season 8|Bloodline]]\&quot;, Clark and Lois are both trapped in the Phantom Zone, where they are reunited with Kara. Also Zod&#39;s wife [[Faora]] takes control of Lois&#39; body so she can be set free by Kara, and goes on a rampage in Metropolis. In the season 10 episode \&quot;Icarus\&quot;, Clark uses a crystal of El to send [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]] to the Zone. When Wilson is found back on Earth in \&quot;Dominion\&quot;, Clark and [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] enter the Zone to see how that escape was possible. They learn that the clone of Zod - who was sent to New Krypton with the others - was sent to the Phantom Zone for his crimes. While there he merged with the phantom of the original Zod, gaining all of his memories, and a blood transfusion from Clark allowed him to send others out of the Zone. Clark departs the Zone while destroying the control console on the Phantom Zone side in order to prevent anyone else from leaving.\n* In the pilot episode of &#39;&#39;[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]&#39;&#39;, Kara&#39;s capsule accidentally ended up in the Phantom Zone - which is depicted as an actual area of real-space in which time does not pass/exist rather than a separate dimension - following Krypton&#39;s explosion. It was also shown that the Phantom Zone had a maximum security prison called Fort Rozz which housed criminals like Astra, Caren Falqnerr, the Commander, Dr. Alphonse Luzano, Gabriel Phillips, Gor, a [[Hellgrammite (comics)|Hellgrammite]], [[Brainiac 8|Indigo]], [[Jemm]], [[Khunds|K&#39;hund]], Kerfuffle, Moyer, Mur, [[Non (comics)|Non]], Tor, and [[Vartox]] where they have personal issues with [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Alura|Alura Zor-El]] who had them imprisoned in Fort Rozz Prison. The [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Carl Draper|Master Jailer]] was one of the prison guards in Fort Rozz. When Kara&#39;s capsule left the Phantom Zone, Fort Rozz was intentionally pulled out with her as Indigo revealed that she took control of Kara&#39;s escape pod in order to do that. As a result of Fort Rozz being pulled out of the Phantom Zone and crashing on Earth, many of its inmates had escaped. Additionally, there is also a Phantom Zone projector - a device used by Kryptonians to transport prisoners in Fort Rozz into the Zone. It was later collected and stored in the [[Fortress of Solitude]] by Kal-El. In \&quot;Resist\&quot;, Kara, Lilian Luthor and [[Cyborg Superman|Hank Henshaw]] use this projector to board into a Daxamite ship during their invasion to save [[Lena Luthor]] and Mon-El from Rhea. After rescuing them, Lilian betrays and leaves Kara and Mon-El behind while beaming her daughter and themselves to the Fortress. However, Kara expected her betrayal and her friend [[Toyman|Winn Schott Jr.]] put a bug device on Hank prior to the rescue operation. Supergirl turned on the device to force Hank to reactivate the projector to beam Mon-El out of the spaceship, while she stayed behind to confront Rhea. In season 5, it was revealed that the Green Martians had utilized the Phantom Zone which they used to imprison [[Ma&#39;alefa&#39;ak]] and [[Midnight (DC Comics)|Midnight]].\n* The Phantom Zone appears in the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Action]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Field Trip\&quot;. As Superman gives [[Blue Beetle]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] a tour of the Fortress of Solitude, they are shown to the Phantom Zone projector where General Zod, Faora and Quex-Ul are accidentally released and Superman is accidentally trapped. With some guidance from [[Firestorm (comics)|Martin Stein]], Firestorm learns how to transmute some of the ice into Kryptonite to weaken the Kryptonian villains. Afterwards, Superman is freed from the Phantom Zone and the Kryptonian villains are thrown back into the Phantom Zone.\n*The Phantom Zone briefly appears in the episode \&quot;Devil&#39;s Snare\&quot; from the first season of the adult animated series &#39;&#39;[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]&#39;&#39;. Believing [[Harley Quinn|Harley]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], and their crew are behind a series of man-eating trees terrorizing Gotham, Superman and the Justice League prepare to trap them all in the Phantom Zone before Ivy uses [[Wonder Woman]]&#39;s [[Lasso of Truth]] to clear their names. The Phantom Zone appears again in the second season episode \&quot;Lovers&#39; Quarrel\&quot;, where Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman attempt to imprison Ivy, who is mind controlled by [[Doctor Psycho]], inside it, but are stopped by Harley.\n* The Phantom Zone is mentioned in the 2019 animated series, &#39;&#39;[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]&#39;&#39;, in two-part episode, \&quot;DC Super Hero Boys\&quot;.\n\n===Films===\n* In the 1950 film serial, &#39;&#39;Atom Man vs. Superman&#39;&#39;, Lex Luthor traps Superman in another dimension. Though the &#39;&#39;Phantom Zone&#39;&#39; would not appear in the comics until 11 years later, it is styled in the same fashion and is named by Luthor as &#39;&#39;the Empty Doom&#39;&#39;.\n* In the 1978 [[Superman (1978 film)|&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; film]] starring [[Christopher Reeve]], the Phantom Zone is presented as a large, flat rhombus-shaped mirror that moves by spinning. Jor-El ([[Marlon Brando]]), who developed the Phantom Zone summons it with a wand to imprison [[General Zod]] ([[Terence Stamp]]) and his co-conspirators [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] ([[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]]), and [[Non (comics)|Non]] ([[Jack O&#39;Halloran]]), who appear to be transferred into the two-dimensional space on the mirror&#39;s surface, which is then flung into deep space. The Phantom Zone is only referred to by name in the extended versions of &#39;&#39;[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]&#39;&#39; when it is mentioned by the Kryptonian First Elder. Superman&#39;s mother Lara refers to the Phantom Zone by name in &#39;&#39;Superman II&#39;&#39; when she first makes the revelation about the three villains contained inside it. In his DVD commentary, director Richard Donner refers to it as \&quot;the Zone of Silence\&quot;.\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Superman II]]&#39;&#39;, as Superman saves the city of [[Paris]] from destruction by hurling a nuclear bomb into space; the resulting nuclear explosion inadvertently shatters the Phantom Zone and releases the three prisoners. Now free, General Zod and his cohorts travel to [[Earth]], wreaking havoc with the superpowers granted to them by Earth&#39;s yellow sun. The Phantom Zone appears in [[Richard Donner]]&#39;s [[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|cut of &#39;&#39;Superman II&#39;&#39;]], released in November 2006. In this version (per the original shooting script prior to being altered by director [[Richard Lester]] for the theatrical version), the Phantom Zone is shattered by the rocket Superman threw into space in the [[Superman (1978 film)|first &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; film]]. The Zone is shown splitting into three separate shards, one containing each villain, before it finally shatters, freeing them. Jor-El presents a visual representation of the Phantom Zone and its occupants in a recorded message embedded in the education crystals housed at the [[Fortress of Solitude]], unaware that he is actually talking to [[Lex Luthor]] and Miss Teschmacher. After defeating Zod and his followers, Superman uses a time-warp to keep the three criminals imprisoned in the Phantom Zone while undoing the damage they had done during their time on Earth.\n* In the 1984 &#39;&#39;[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]&#39;&#39; movie, the sorceress Selena banishes Kara to the Phantom Zone by means of a summoned crystal shard. The crystal transports her to a barren, desolate world where it shatters, casting her to the ground. This depiction of the Phantom Zone suggests that the crystal shard seen in the first two Superman movies is not the Phantom Zone itself, but simply a vehicle that takes prisoners to this desolate wasteland which is referred to as the Phantom Zone, similar to the later &#39;&#39;[[Smallville]]&#39;&#39; TV series. Once in the zone, Kara loses her powers as Supergirl and becomes an ordinary mortal. In this movie, it is also revealed that there is a way out of the Zone, although the trip to the exit portal is extremely dangerous and would almost lead to certain death. Kara is guided to this portal by Zaltar, another Kryptonian who was banished there. Kara is successfully able to transport herself back to Earth using this portal, although Zaltar is killed in the attempt. Following Kara&#39;s escape, the defeated Selena and her henchwoman Bianca are both banished to the Phantom Zone.\n* In the [[direct-to-video]] animated feature &#39;&#39;[[Superman: Brainiac Attacks]]&#39;&#39;, Superman had to enter the Phantom Zone to retrieve a rare element which will cure [[Lois Lane]] of a deadly disease. This version of the Phantom Zone differs from the previous animated continuity, as it is shown to actually be populated by \&quot;phantoms\&quot; and Superman retains his powers in the Phantom Zone.\n* The Phantom Zone is featured in &#39;&#39;[[All-Star Superman (film)|All-Star Superman]]&#39;&#39;. Like the comics, Superman places Bar-El and Lilo into the Phantom Zone until a cure for their Kryptonite illness can be found.\n* In the 2013 reboot film &#39;&#39;[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]&#39;&#39;, General Zod, Faora, Car-Vex, Dev-Em II, Jax-Ur, Nadira, Nam-Ek, Tor-An, and some unnamed followers of General Zod are sentenced to 300 cycles of somatic reconditioning in the Phantom Zone following their attempted [[coup d&#39;\u00e9tat]] against the Kryptonian government and General Zod&#39;s murder of Jor-El. Upon sentencing, Zod and his co-conspirators are infused within a gelatinous substance, encased in a crystalline material and are subsequently loaded into a Kryptonian [[Black Zero|ship]]. The ship then launches into orbit around Krypton where three smaller vessels establish a window into the Phantom Zone into which the ship enters. A short time later, the destruction of Krypton triggers the release of the prisoners. Later in the film, it is revealed that the vessels Zod and his army are using possess a \&quot;Phantom Drive\&quot;, a collision from a smaller ship (piloted by Col. Hardy of the U.S. military with Kal-El&#39;s rocket and operated by [[Professor Hamilton|Professor Emil Hamilton]] and [[Lois Lane]]) with a similar drive causes a cataclysmic reaction that creates a small singularity, returning the ship and its occupants to the Phantom Zone along with the Military plane, Hardy, and Hamilton.\n* The Phantom Zone appears in &#39;&#39;[[The Lego Batman Movie]]&#39;&#39;. It appears as a prison for the most dangerous villains in the Lego multiverse. The setting on the Phantom Zone Projector when releasing the inmates are \&quot;[[Dark Lord]]s Only\&quot;, \&quot;Witches &amp; Queens Only\&quot;, \&quot;Monsters &amp; Robots Only\&quot;, and \&quot;Release All Inmates\&quot;. Its gatekeeper \&quot;Phyllis\&quot; (voiced by [[Ellie Kemper]]) resembles a generic Lego brick and reviews the bad things the new arrivals have done. The Phantom Zone&#39;s inmates consist of villains from various fictional franchises including [[General Zod]], [[King Kong]], [[Lord Voldemort]] from &#39;&#39;[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]&#39;&#39;, [[Sauron]]&#39;s Eye of Sauron from &#39;&#39;[[Lord of the Rings]]&#39;&#39;, the [[Dalek]]s from &#39;&#39;[[Doctor Who]]&#39;&#39;, the [[Gremlins]], the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and her [[Winged monkeys|Flying Monkeys]] from &#39;&#39;[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]&#39;&#39;, Lord Vampyre, the Evil Mummy, and a Swamp Creature from &#39;&#39;[[Lego Monster Fighters]]&#39;&#39;, the [[Kraken]] from &#39;&#39;[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]&#39;&#39;, [[Medusa]] from &#39;&#39;[[Lego Minifigures (theme)|Lego Minifigures]]&#39;&#39;, the skeletons from &#39;&#39;[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]&#39;&#39;, [[Agent Smith]] and his clones from &#39;&#39;[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]&#39;&#39;, the titular [[great white shark]] from &#39;&#39;[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]&#39;&#39;, and the &#39;&#39;[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]&#39;&#39; and a &#39;&#39;[[Velociraptor]]&#39;&#39; from &#39;&#39;[[Jurassic Park]]&#39;&#39;. This group of villains have been referred to as the \&quot;Ubers\&quot; in the credits. Superman talked about it on the news program \&quot;Metropolis in Focus\&quot; as a tie-in to his latest victory over General Zod. When the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] gets sent to the Phantom Zone by Batman, he persuades the inmates that he meets in the Phantom Zone to help him take over Gotham City. After infiltrating Arkham Asylum, [[Harley Quinn]] helps release them using the Phantom Zone Projector under the \&quot;Release All Inmates\&quot; option. With help from Robin, Batgirl, Alfred Pennyworth, and Gotham City&#39;s villains, Batman manages to defeat the villains and send them back to the Phantom Zone. This is the second depiction of the Joker being banished to the Phantom Zone, the first being in the story \&quot;Truth and Justice\&quot; by J.C. Roberts.\n\n===Video games===\n* In the [[video game]] &#39;&#39;[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]&#39;&#39;, the DC portion of the story mode concludes with [[Shao Kahn|Emperor Shao Kahn]] being imprisoned in the Phantom Zone after Superman defeats Dark Kahn. In Shao Kahn&#39;s single player ending, it is revealed that the Phantom Zone has the opposite effect on him. Rather than being depowered, Shao Kahn is re-energized by the Phantom Zone\u2019s energies and breaks free of it with an untold number of prisoners who swear allegiance to Shao Kahn for releasing them. The Phantom Zone in the game resembles its portrayal from &#39;&#39;[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Superman II]]&#39;&#39;.\n* The Phantom Zone appears in &#39;&#39;[[DC Universe Online]]&#39;&#39;. Lex Luthor frees General Zod from it during the Fortress of Solitude raid in order to combat Brainiac&#39;s assimilation of the Fortress. During the Phantom Zone alert, players receive a signal from it and are asked to investigate by Superman, and it turns out to be a trap meant for him. Time appears to pass at a much slower rate inside the zone, as Superman mentions weeks have passed outside during the alert as he rescues the player team.\n* The Phantom Zone appears in &#39;&#39;[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]&#39;&#39;, also resembling its portrayal in &#39;&#39;[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Superman II]]&#39;&#39;. According to some character profiles, the Phantom Zone is used by the alternate Superman to \&quot;re-educate\&quot; several supervillains into joining the Regime, suggesting that the alternate Superman spares villains if he believes they could be useful (such as [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Killer Frost]]). Near the end of Story Mode, the Zone is used by the \&quot;prime\&quot; Superman to safely seal away the alternate Doomsday after the monster is defeated. A portal leading into the Phantom Zone can be found in the Fortress of Solitude stage, combatants can be knocked into a Phantom Zone projector and then spat out of a portal taking damage. They can also be knocked into the Phantom Zone itself at the far left side of the menagerie section where they will collide with one of the crystal fragments housing a monstrous \&quot;Phantom\&quot;. The inmate will proceed to take a bite out of the fighter&#39;s shoulder before being knocked off by a floating rock, and then the fighter will fall through a second Zone portal winding up in the laboratory section of the stage. The character General Zod has limited control of the Phantom Zone as part of his special moves, and can summon an inmate for help as well as momentarily trap his opponent within the Phantom Zone. If Classic Battle is cleared, a cutscene will show the Regime&#39;s Superman being sucked into the Phantom Zone&#39;s portal in the menagerie. As he is pulled closer to the portal while refusing to get away, he has several flashbacks of Lois Lane, her death at the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]&#39;s hands, the destruction of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and his murder of the Joker, the Regime&#39;s Superman gets his soul taken by the Phantom Zone&#39;s portal before being pulled into the Phantom Zone by a \&quot;Phantom\&quot;. The Regime&#39;s Superman is then seen trapped inside a diamond-shaped crystal screaming in anguish as he drifts further into the Phantom Zone. General Zod&#39;s ending in Classic Battle reveals that Zod&#39;s imprisonment has granted him the knowledge necessary to utilize some of the Phantom Zone at will (explaining some of his in-game abilities) as well as his plans to use such abilities in future conquests after he has trapped the Regime&#39;s Superman in the Phantom Zone and took over the Regime so that he can make Earth into the image of Krypton.\n* The Phantom Zone projector appears in &#39;&#39;[[Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure]]&#39;&#39;. General Zod escapes from the Phantom Zone and seals Superman in it. Maxwell manages to free Superman and place General Zod back in the Phantom Zone.\n* The Phantom Zone appears in &#39;&#39;[[Lego Dimensions]]&#39;&#39;. It appears as the fifth stage of the &#39;&#39;Lego Batman Movie&#39;&#39; story pack, adapting its role from the film.\n* The Phantom Zone appears in &#39;&#39;[[Injustice 2]]&#39;&#39;. If Batman defeats Superman in the story&#39;s climax, he depowers Superman with a machine similar to the one from &#39;&#39;Superman II&#39;&#39; and sends him into the Phantom Zone. However, Superman swears to return. In Batman&#39;s character ending, Batman goes into semi-retirement to head the emergency response in the wake of Brainiac&#39;s attack as Bruce Wayne, leaving the reformed Barry Allen and Hal Jordan to lead the Justice League and train the next generation of heroes, though behind the scenes as Batman he prepares for the possibility of Superman&#39;s escape from the Phantom Zone by developing Kryptonite-based weaponry. In [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]]&#39;s ending, Sub-Zero is accidentally transported to Injustice Earth by the magic unleashed by Kotal Kahn&#39;s retreat from Earthrealm to Outworld. He helps to defeat Brainiac and thanks Batman and the Justice League for offer to help him return to Earthrealm, though they inadvertently open a portal to the Phantom Zone that frees Superman, [[General Zod]], [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]], and [[Non (comics)|Non]]. Feeling responsible, Sub-Zero fights alongside Batman&#39;s Justice League to defeat Superman and his Kryptonian allies.\n\n===Novels===\n* In [[Kevin J. Anderson]]&#39;s novel &#39;&#39;The Last Days of Krypton&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref&gt;DC Comics; HarperCollins and Harper, New York, New York, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-06-134075-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jor-El discovered and was temporarily trapped in the Phantom Zone. Later, after General Zod&#39;s (Dru-Zod&#39;s) insurgence/rebellion, Zod and his consort Aethyr-Ka, as well as his muscle-man Nam-Ek, were imprisoned in the Phantom Zone. In a mistaken attempt to destroy the Phantom Zone, where Zod had trapped some of his enemies, the revived Council of Krypton cast the Phantom Zone to the center of the Planet Krypton, causing, first its implosion, then its explosion. Fortunately Jor-El and Lara were able to rescue their son Kal-El by sending him into space just before the planet&#39;s explosion. He arrived on Earth where he became known as [[Clark Kent]]/[[Superman]].\n\n===Parodies and homages===\n* In the &#39;&#39;[[South Park]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;[[Krazy Kripples]]\&quot;, Christopher Reeve is imprisoned in one after eating too many fetuses.\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Bartman Meets Radioactive Man]]&#39;&#39;, Radioactive Man is imprisoned in the Limbo Zone.\n* &#39;&#39;[[Family Guy]]&#39;&#39; parodied the Phantom Zone in the episode \&quot;[[Lethal Weapons]]\&quot;. When Peter announced that \&quot;Krypton sucks\&quot;, General Zod, Non, and Ursa came by and were promptly bested in a fight by Lois, and imprisoned in a Phantom Zone reminiscent of the Superman movies. In the episode \&quot;[[Hot Pocket-Dial]]\&quot;, General Zod is shown to live next door to the apartment that Glenn Quagmire moved into and told him that he was blocking his \&quot;trapezoid-shaped thing\&quot; (a reference to the Phantom Zone of the Superman movies).\n* An &#39;&#39;[[American Dad!]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;[[The Most Adequate Christmas Ever]]\&quot; shows that God imprisoned [[Jim Henson]] and [[Kermit the Frog]] in the Phantom Zone when they tried to get into Heaven. It then shows Jim Henson and Kermit the Frog flying above in their rectangular prison as they beg to be released.\n* A dimension referred to as the \&quot;Null Void\&quot; appears in the television series &#39;&#39;[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]&#39;&#39; (and its various iterations &#39;&#39;[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien]]&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;[[Ben 10: Omniverse]]&#39;&#39;) and is used as an inter-dimensional prison for containing various alien criminals in the Ben 10 universe. It is primarily accessible via a \&quot;Null Void Generator\&quot;, a device similar in design and application to Superman&#39;s Phantom Zone Projector. In some episodes of &#39;&#39;Ben 10: Alien Force&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Ben 10: Ultimate Alien&#39;&#39;, there is a version of Incarcecon that is in the Null Void which is used to imprison the criminals there.\n* A [[Lego]] set released in 2017, titled \&quot;Batman in the Phantom Zone\&quot; features a Batman minifigure and a machine.\n* In the opening skit of the [[Robot Chicken (season 2)|season 2]] premiere of &#39;&#39;[[Robot Chicken]]&#39;&#39; titled \&quot;Suck It\&quot;, series co-creator [[Seth Green]], along with the robot chicken and mad scientist from the opening credits sequence, were briefly banished to the Phantom Zone (similar to that of the Superman movies) after being found guilty from his trial following the show&#39;s \&quot;cancellation\&quot; from [[Robot Chicken (season 1)|season 1]].\n* [[Lord Buckethead]]&#39;s manifesto in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election]] included a promise to exile [[Katie Hopkins]] to the Phantom Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-friday-edition-1.4153621/meet-lord-buckethead-the-u-k-election-s-intergalactic-spacelord-1.4153627|title=Meet Lord Buckethead, the U.K. election&#39;s intergalactic spacelord}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Similar dimensions==\nThere had been similar Zones that were in comparison to the Phantom Zone:\n\n* The Silver Age Phantom Zone appears to be prefigured in the 1950 Superman serial &#39;&#39;[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]&#39;&#39;, in which [[Lex Luthor]] uses a kind of matter-transmitter device to trap Superman in a limbo called the \&quot;Empty Doom\&quot; from which he can see and hear events in the \&quot;real\&quot; world, but cannot touch anything or be seen or heard.\n* In the [[Captain Future]] novel &#39;&#39;Planets in Peril&#39;&#39; (1942) by [[Edmond Hamilton]], Chapter 13 \&quot;Phantom Prisoners\&quot;, Captain Future is sent to the \&quot;Vault of the Unbodied\&quot;...essentially an early version of the Phantom Zone. Hamilton later went on to write some of the early DC comics Superman stories, including some Phantom Zone stories.\n* Additionally, in the story \&quot;Wonder Woman&#39;s Wedding Day\&quot; from &#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #70 (November 1954), [[Wonder Woman]] is sent by Professor Uxo to another dimension much like the Phantom Zone, in which she becomes a spectral observer, unable to interact with those around her. She is able to escape by telepathically overwhelming Professor Uxo with the thought she is watching his every move, forcing him to \&quot;reassemble\&quot; her in his laboratory before a barrage of bullets, which she easily deflects. Wonder Woman captures Professor Uxo and his henchmen as they are taken away by the police while his \&quot;time dimension transfer machine\&quot; is damaged beyond repair.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181628/http://supermanica.superman.nu/wiki/index.php/Phantom_Zone Supermanica: Phantom Zone] Supermanica entry on the Pre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Phantom Zone\n* [https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Zone Phantom Zone] at DC Comics Wiki\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/phantom-zone/34-42370/ Phantom Zone] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Superman}}\n{{Justice League characters}}\n{{Otto Binder}}\n\n[[Category:DC Comics dimensions]]\n[[Category:DC Comics planets]]\n[[Category:DC Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Fictional dimensions]]\n[[Category:Legion of Super-Heroes]]\n[[Category:DC Comics prisons]]&quot;</span>
