It is led by the supervillain Thaal Sinestro.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe Sinestro Corps first appears in Green Lantern vol. 4 #10 and was created by Geoff Johns and Ethan Van Sciver.\n\n\n== Fictional history ==\n\n\n=== Before the Corps ===\n\nThe Parallax entity is a space parasite that is the embodiment of fear that was imprisoned within the Central Power Battery on Oa. As time passed, the entity became known as the yellow impurity, the cause for the power rings&#39; weakness to the color yellow.Thaal Sinestro, at the time the universe&#39;s greatest Green Lantern, was sent to Earth by Supernova in a plot to erase Guy Gardner from history. Booster Gold was assigned to prevent this from happening. To do so, he convinced Sinestro to leave Earth, claiming that he was an admirer from the future, and that his yellow Legion of Super-Heroes flight ring was a tribute to Sinestro. When asked what Corps he belongs to, Booster ad-libbed, \&quot;The...Sinestro Corps\&quot;, leading Sinestro to twirl his mustache in thought while mumbling, \&quot;Of course...Of course.\&quot;After Sinestro went rogue, he was banished by the Guardians of the Universe to Qward in the antimatter universe. When he returned, he wielded a power ring which used yellow energy. After various encounters with Earth&#39;s Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, he was imprisoned within the Central Power Battery. There he was able to use his ring, which uses fear, as opposed to willpower, as a power source, to awaken Parallax from hibernation. From there, Parallax and Sinestro were able to influence the fall of Hal Jordan and instigate the fall of the Green Lantern Corps, leaving one last Green Lantern: Kyle Rayner.\n\n\n=== Recruitment drive ===\n\nAfter the Green Lantern Corps was restarted with the return of Hal Jordan, the Sinestro Corps began actively recruiting members, offering yellow power rings and a role in the Corps to those who can \&quot;instill great fear\&quot;. Members of the Corps are immediately taken to Qward to \&quot;...be subjected to psychological and physical reconditioning\&quot;. The members of the Sinestro Corps work in sectors, like the Green Lantern Corps. Qward also has a huge yellow Central Battery on its surface like the one used on Oa. Although the Sinestro Corps uses fear, and opposes the Green Lantern Corps and the Guardians, Sinestro has stated their goal is to bring order to the universe, which he claims the Guardians have failed to do.\nArkillo, a large and muscular vicious alien, is enslaving all the Qwardian Weaponers and forcing them to continuously build new yellow rings which are programmed to breach the barrier between the antimatter and matter universes to find and recruit new ring-wielders. Arkillo also serves as the Sinestro Corps&#39; drill sergeant, similar to Kilowog&#39;s role in the GLC.Members recruited include Karu-Sil, raised by animals; Despotellis, a sentient virus capable of attacking Lanterns from the inside; and Bedovian, the sniper of the Corps, capable of taking out a target from three sectors away.During this time, the Sinestro Corps attempted to recruit Batman, known even to some alien races for his formidable ability to instill fear in others. However, Batman&#39;s willpower combined with his previous brief exposure to a power ring allowed him to reject the yellow ring before it took him to be properly trained and molded into one of Sinestro&#39;s soldiers. The yellow ring then sought a replacement and selected Amon Sur, the disgruntled son of Abin Sur, who was on Earth attempting to steal Hal Jordan&#39;s ring.\n\n\n=== The prophecy ===\nIt was revealed that after untold millennia, the Weaponers of Qward, Ranx the Sentient City, the Children of the White Lobe, and the Empire of Tears will rise united against the Green Lantern Corps. This was largely ignored up until upgraded Manhunters started to appear throughout the universe. Hal Jordan encountered one on Earth and, with Guy Gardner, followed their trail to Sector 3601. Hal and Guy found several Green Lanterns, all of whom were assumed to have been killed during the Emerald Twilight saga, and the Manhunters&#39; new grandmaster Hank Henshaw, the Cyborg Superman. The Manhunters were defeated and Henshaw&#39;s head was brought to Oa. The Book of Oa has a forbidden chapter on cosmic prophecies, which includes the following:\n\nA face of metal and flesh shall speak of the secrets of the 52.Fear will rise.Willpower will gather.\nAnd a war of light will unleash the truth behind the power of the ring.\n\nAfter his interrogation, the Guardians learned that Henshaw is aware of the fifty-two parallel universes and that if New Earth was destroyed, the new Multiverse would collapse and the Antimatter universe would take its place. Two of the Guardians, Ganthet and Sayd, warn the other Guardians not to ignore the prophecy because it could destroy the Green Lantern Corps.\n\n\n=== The Sinestro Corps War ===\n\nFollowing his defeat in Green Lantern: Rebirth, the events of Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 Sinestro retreats to the planet Qward in the antimatter universe. There he amasses an army, the Sinestro Corps, that he selects based upon their ability to \&quot;inspire great fear\&quot;. Each member is armed with a yellow power ring, mirroring the green ones of the Green Lantern Corps. Amongst Sinestro&#39;s allies are Parallax and the resurrected Anti-Monitor. The Sinestro Corps then launches an all-out assault against the Green Lantern Corps and the universe itself. During the assault on Oa, the Sinestro Corps manages to inflict heavy casualties and free Superman-Prime and the Cyborg Superman from their imprisonment. Kyle Rayner is captured and transported to Qward, where Sinestro manages to separate Rayner from the symbiote Ion allowing Parallax to possess him. Hal Jordan, John Stewart, and Guy Gardner return to Earth to warn the Justice League of the Anti-Monitor&#39;s return.\nAs the Sinestro Corps spreads out to ambush Green Lanterns across the universe, Green Lantern vol. 4 #23 sees the Guardians deciding to rewrite their sacred text, the Book of Oa. They add 10 new laws, the first of which authorizes the use of lethal force against the Sinestro Corps. As the Green Lanterns gather on Oa in preparation for a Sinestro Corps assault, the Sinestro Corps teleport themselves and their Central Power Battery instead to a new Warworld, their objective revealed to be Earth. Events in Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #16 show Hal informing the Green Lantern Corps of Sinestro&#39;s plans.Green Lantern vol. 4 #24 continues the story, with Green Lanterns and Sinestro Corps members battling across Earth. Hal manages to free Kyle from Parallax before the entity is imprisoned in their power batteries by Ganthet and Sayd. After John and Guy arrive, the former Guardians reveal to them the prophecy of the \&quot;Blackest Night\&quot;, seen in Green Lantern vol. 4 #25. It foretells of five more Corps arising, each based on a different color and emotion. After the five corps are established, a \&quot;War of Light\&quot; will ensue, in which all the corps are destroyed, leading to the \&quot;Blackest Night\&quot;.The Guardians arrive on Earth and appoint Sodam Yat to be the new Ion. After a lengthy struggle in New York City, the Sinestro Corps are defeated by the overwhelming numbers against them. One of the Guardians sacrifices himself to send Superman-Prime to an alternate universe, while Hal and Kyle subdue and arrest Sinestro in Coast City. In the aftermath of the battle, seen in Green Lantern vol. 4 #25, the Guardians decide to bring the second of the new laws into effect. After realizing that the \&quot;Blackest Night\&quot; prophecy will come to pass, Ganthet and Sayd depart after creating a blue power ring with the intention of creating their own Corps, based on the spreading of Hope to the rest of the universe. The Anti-Monitor, having been blown across the vacuum of space at the battle&#39;s climax, finds itself on a dark planet. There it is transformed by an unknown force into a Black Power Battery.\n\n\n=== Blackest Night ===\n\nFollowing the Sinestro Corps War, the Green Lantern Corps tracked down the abandoned Sinestro rings and prevented them from finding new bearers. Among these is Amon Sur&#39;s ring, which attempts to recruit the self-proclaimed \&quot;Master of Fear\&quot;, Jonathan Crane. The surviving members of the Sinestro Corps continue to try to bring fear to the Green Lanterns, in part by murdering the family members of Green Lanterns. Meanwhile, Mongul (who had since obtained a yellow ring in the aftermath of the war) begins his quest to take command of the Sinestro Corps in their namesake&#39;s absence. After obtaining an additional five rings by killing corpsmen who refused to follow him, Mongul takes over the planet Daxam and then a large contingent of the Sinestro Corps, after besting Arkillo in one-on-one combat, he becomes the new leader of the Sinestro Corps. In \&quot;Rage of the Red Lanterns\&quot; #1, a group of rogue Sinestro Corps members still loyal to Sinestro release him from Green Lantern custody as he is being transferred for execution. Their rescue attempt is temporarily spoiled by an attack from Atrocitus and his newly formed Red Lantern Corps.Sinestro is abducted by Atrocitus&#39; forces and brought to the Red Lantern base planet: Ysmault. Planning to use Sinestro&#39;s blood for their own means, Sinestro&#39;s faction of the Sinestro Corps eventually arrive and liberate him from the Red Lanterns. After their escape, Sinestro and his faction of the Sinestro Corps return to Qward, revealing that there is a backup Central Power Battery. Sinestro orders his men to free the Sinestro Corps members imprisoned on Zamaron by the Star Sapphires and meet him on the darkside of Daxam&#39;s moon. After Sinestro attends to \&quot;family business\&quot;, they will retake the Sinestro Corps from Mongul. In addition to those members imprisoned on Zamaron, Sinestro Corps members are also being held prisoner on Oa. Their power rings are held in containment along with other rings (abandoned due to casualty in war) that were prevented from finding new bearers. When Red Lantern Vice is freed from confinement in his sciencell, he attacks the Green Lantern jailer. Though the imprisoned members of the Sinestro Corps initially cheer him on, they find that he is just as likely of attacking them in his rage. During the jail break, Scar frees the yellow power rings and they find their bearers in the sciencells. Upon being reunited with her ring, Lyssa Drak claims to once again be able to feel the Book of Parallax. Now armed with their rings the Sinestro Corps join in the battle with the Green Lanterns and Vice.The faction of the Sinestro Corps led by Sinestro are planning an invasion of Zamaron, homeworld of the Star Sapphires, in order to retake the female Corps members being held prisoner there. After being repelled from Daxam, Mongul&#39;s faction (which he has renamed as \&quot;The Mongul Corps\&quot;) invades Korugar. Sinestro&#39;s rescue attempt is interrupted by a Black Lantern attack, which he only survives through the arrival of Hal Jordan and Indigo-1, leader of the Indigo Tribe. Indigo-1 brings Sinestro to Korugar, so that he may finally confront Mongul. After a fierce battle, Sinestro activates the override systems in Mongul&#39;s rings, using them to imprison him inside the Sinestro Corps Central Power Battery, thus overthrowing Mongul,taking control of the Mongul Corps,and renaming it \&quot;The Sinestro Corps\&quot; after himself. When he departs with Hal Jordan&#39;s group of light-wielders, he commands his Corps to gather at Korugar and protect it while he is away.In the aftermath of Blackest Night, the Sinestro Corps and Green Lantern Corps maintain a fragile truce where neither will attack each other. However, while helping Hal Jordan and the ring-wielders of the other five corps investigate the abduction of the emotional entities, Sinestro is separated from his ring and imprisoned in the Book of the Black, along with the other five members of the group, with Hal only just managing to escape with their rings. When Sinestro and the others escape, renegade Guardian Krona takes command of their rings, prompting Sinestro to attack Krona on his own, with the unexpected result that he is once again chosen as a Green Lantern.\n\n\n=== The New 52 ===\nReturning to Korugar after the Guardians decide to leave him with the ring, Sinestro learns that his Corps have reverted to their brutal methods, terrorising and slaughtering the people of Korugar rather than ruling it, Sinestro creating a new Green Lantern ring for Hal Jordan albeit one that he can shut off at will so that Jordan can help him retake control of the Sinestro Corps, who now want him dead in the belief that his killer will become the new Sinestro Corps leader. After turning various Korugarian prisoners into a temporary Green Lantern Corps using short-lived duplicates of Sinestro&#39;s ring, Sinestro and Hal are able to hold off the Sinestro Corps long enough to drain the power away from the Central Power Battery of the Sinestro Corps, de-powering all of the Corps members on Korugar, although those more distant from the battery will still have access to their own power supplies. Later all Lanterns&#39; rings registered that the Sinestro Corps have disbanded with 98% of all known Corpsmen dead or incarcerated, requiring Arkillo, who was cut off from the other Corps in the Orrery with the New Guardians during this attack, to use a new, independent power battery forged by the Weaponer from the fear of the Korugarians. It has since been revealed that the Guardians were responsible for Sinestro acquiring a Green Lantern ring in an attempt to undermine the Sinestro Corps as part of their future plans to destroy all seven Corps. During the conclusion of the \&quot;Wrath of the First Lantern\&quot; storyline, Sinestro becomes once again a member of the Sinestro Corps and after bonding with Parallax, he reactivates the yellow rings and releases all the Sinestro Corps members who were incarcerated on Oa.In the aftermath of the war with the New Gods of New Genesis, Sinestro has created Warworld into the new base and headquarters of the Sinestro Corps, after the Green Lantern Corps have vanished into another universe.\n\n\n=== DC Rebirth ===\nSubsequently, in DC Rebirth, Sinestro uses the opportunity to establish the Sinestro Corps as the new force of &#39;order&#39; in the universe, albeit through imposing fear rather than inspiring faith, with Soranik joining her father out of a lack of perceived options. However, as they establish a presence where Oa was once located, Hal Jordan forges a new ring for himself as the rest of the Corps return to this universe.Sinestro then sends out his enforcers of his Corps to control the new order of the universe with fear. The Sinestro Corps attacks a planet, but soon Hal emerges and returns of being Green Lantern in the fight. Hal attacks with his full powers causing the Sinestro Corps members to flee as Hal pursuits them. He follows them on the planet, as all the Sinestro Corps are to restrain him. While Hal tried to battle them, the Sinestro Corps gain the full power of fear throughout the universe to defeat him, and were ordered by Sinestro to bring Hal alive. The Sinestro Corps return to the base with granting to Sinestro with the captured Green Lantern, who they thought was Hal, but is actually Guy Gardner instead. Furious, Sinestro demands where Hal is. A Corps member mistook that rebel of being Soranik Natu, who has secured Hal safely. The Sinestro Corps are used to capture the people of the universe and imprison them in Warworld&#39;s engine to increase the power of fear.When Hal has recovered, he invades Warworld and attacks the Sinestro Corps. They were about to attack, but their leader Sinestro appears and orders his Corps to stop so that he and Hal can go face to face in battle. Before Sinestro attacks him, he discovers too late his powers are decreased due to Soranik rescuing people from being imprisoned and escapes with them. Hal then uses his energies as a living construct to incinerate the Fear Warlord, apparently destroying the Sinestro Corps&#39; leader.\n\n\n== Prominent members ==\n\nLike the Green Lantern Corps, the Sinestro Corps has 7200 ring bearers, two for each of the 3600 sectors of space.\n\n\n=== Leadership ===\nThaal Sinestro (of Sector 1417): An anthropologist from the planet Korugar who was specializing in reconstructing the ruins of long-dead civilization when indoctrinated into the Green Lantern Corps by the Green Lantern Phrohl Gosgotha, who crash-landed in one of the ruins and died giving his green power ring to Sinestro, advising him to use it to defend himself from a Weaponer of Qward who pursued the Lantern. Taking Gosgotha&#39;s post, Sinestro became one of the greatest Green Lanterns alongside Abin Sur because of his desire for order, which eventually led him to the idea of secretly becoming a dictator on Korugar. However, this rule over his own planet was exposed to Sur&#39;s successor, Hal Jordan, who was helping him stop an attempted Khund invasion on Korugar. As a result, Sinestro was brought before the Guardians and banished to Qward. There, he plotted his revenge by allying himself with the Weaponers of Qward who created a yellow power ring for so he can face and outnumber the Guardians and the Green Lanterns as the leader and namesake of the Sinestro Corps.\nMongul (of Sector 2811): The son of a longtime foe of Superman also named Mongul. After the end of the war, he found a downed Sinestro Corps member and broke his neck, taking his ring for himself. Defeated by the Green Lantern Bzzd when he attacked him from within, flying out through his eye. Mongul was then thrown to the planet of the Black Mercys, where Mother Mercy intended to use his body as food for her children. He later broke free, and escaped the planet. He later took charge of the Sinestro Corps, attempting to turn Daxam, and later, Korugar into their new homeworld. However, Sinestro confronted him, and overrode his ring control, trapping him within the Sinestro Corps&#39; central power battery.\nArkillo (of Sector 674): A feared warrior from the planet Vorn who became one of Sinestro&#39;s first recruits, acting as both drill sergeant and carnivore. Arkillo fought Mongul for control of the Sinestro Corps and lost, having his tongue ripped out and forced to wear it around his neck. His tongue was later restored by Saint Walker of the Blue Lantern Corps, who Arkillo grows somewhat attached to. Described by Geoff Johns as the \&quot;Kilowog of the Sinestro Corps.\&quot; Arkillo appears in Green Lantern: New Guardians, acting as the representative of the Sinestro Corps. For a time Arkillo was the only active Sinestro Corps member prior to its rebirth.\n\n\n=== Ring bearers ===\nAnti-Monitor (of Sector -1): A supreme being titled &#39;The Guardian of Fear&#39; who was responsible for the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Anti-Monitor is an almost infinitely powerful threat. Returning in the wake of the events of Infinite Crisis and 52, he allies with Sinestro to form the Sinestro Corps. His agenda is the same as it was in the Crisis - to become sole overlord of the Antimatter Universe upon the destruction of all Matter universes. The Anti-Monitor is later discharged from the Corps.\nKaru-Sil (of Sector 2815): A village girl from the planet Graxos III whose family was killed during a raid on her village, leaving her to fend for herself in the bordering jungle while being raised by animals. While helping her pack attack a boy from neighboring village, the Green Lantern Blish stopped them and delivered Karu-Sil (who he thought the pack was also attacking) to an institute on Graxos IV. However, it was the act of killing one of her psychologists there that she was bailed out of the orphanage by a yellow power ring and became a member of the Sinestro Corps. Karu-Sil was at one time captured by the Zamarons and trapped in a power ring conversion crystal. Before Fatality was released from her crystal, Karu-Sil&#39;s conversion was still shown as being incomplete. She has since been freed.\nDespotellis (of Sector 119): A sentient virus created in a medical lab on the planet Khondra that can kill from within, responsible for the death of 85% of space sector 119 in addition to Kyle Rayner&#39;s mother. Despotellis was also responsible for infecting Mogo with a disease that drove several Green Lanterns (including Kilowog) mad when exposed to Mogo that got Guy Gardner framed for murder, though Isamot Kol gave Guy the benefit of the doubt having noticed earlier that something was strange on Mogo when he was seeking counseling and with Soranik Natu&#39;s help they were able to cure Mogo. Despotellis was defeated by Leezle Pon, a Green Lantern Smallpox Virus shortly after infecting Guy. It was last heard he was imprisoned on Oa.\nAmon Sur (of Sector 2814): The son of deceased Green Lantern Abin Sur who became leader of the Black Circle Crime Syndicate until a battle against Kyle Rayner had him overthrown. Afterwards, he journeyed to Earth, plotting to steal his father&#39;s Green Lantern ring from Hal Jordan by hiring bounty hunters to find him. When he met the hunter who captured Jordan met up with Amon in the desert where Abin was buried, he betrayed Amon and revealed himself as John Stewart in disguise when Amon was about to use his weapon on Jordan in disgust to the fact that he was not worthy to have the ring. In the middle of the fight that followed, a yellow power ring appeared and welcomed Amon as a member of the Sinestro Corps, transporting him away from Earth. This yellow power ring had previously tried to recruit Batman as the Corps member for this sector, and following Amon Sur&#39;s death, it sought out the Scarecrow as its new bearer, but it was destroyed by the Guardians. He was recently revived as a member of the Black Lantern Corps. Through the combined attack of Hal Jordan and Indigo-1, his ring was destroyed, and his body reduced to ash.\nKryb (of Sector 3599): A hag from the planet Vora who kills Green Lanterns who are parents and stores their children in a cage growing out of her back. The other members of Rayner&#39;s team then attacked Kryb in the Sector House, causing an explosion which caused the Sector House&#39;s orbit to begin to decay and fall into the planet. Kryb was taken by Miri Riam to Zamaron and imprisoned in a power ring conversion crystal. She was freed during Sinestro&#39;s assault on Zamaron, and convinced Miri Riam to help her find her children, whose voices she could no longer hear. They discover that the children have become \&quot;Black Lantern Corphans\&quot;, and are attacking the Oan Central Power Battery. When Red Lantern Guy Gardner attacked the children, Kryb attacked him, but he ripped off her arm and shoved it down her throat. She is later seen with the rest of the lanterns descending to protect the Earth from Nekron.\nTekik (of Sector 3281): A robot created on the planet Potter-59-3 that rebelled against its life of servitude, creating a \&quot;fear program\&quot; that infected every other robot on the planet. The planet never recovered from Tekik&#39;s attack, and has since been abandoned and renamed \&quot;the lost world\&quot;. As a result, Tekik came to the attention of a yellow power ring that welcomed him into the Sinestro Corps.\nMurr the Melting Man (Austin Snow) (of Sector 3490): A scientist from the asteroid outpost DW-426 who was changed by an accident with a power source into a mindless being whose touch can melt any other lifeform.\nRomat-Ru (of Sector 2813): A Xudarian who is regarded to be one of the vilest creatures in the universe.\nAmpa Nnn (of Sector 3517): A serial killer from the planet Lythyl, who has a habit of removing the organs of his victims and meticulously cleaning them.\nSuperboy-Prime (of Sector 2813): A younger, alternate dimension version of Superman from Earth Prime and a main antagonist from Infinite Crisis.\nBedovian (of Sector 3): a hermit crab-like cannibalistic sniper who can kill from three space sectors away. He was located and injured by John Stewart. He is shown in Green Lanterns Corp #46, helping to shoot a giant bullet with Dove inside to the Anti-monitor.\nLow (of Sector 3308): The most dangerous parasite in the universe. Can drain every drop of blood out of nearly any being in seconds. Replicates by laying \&quot;eggs\&quot; in the bodies he kills, birthing up to a thousand parasitic slugs from a single carcass.\nEnkafos (of Sector 2981): A strategist who coordinated the Sinestro Corps attack on Mogo and was ultimately killed by Sodam Yat.

Ethan van Sciver has also stated that there will be a &#39;Frankenstein&#39;-inspired member who is two aliens cut in half and sewn together (with each one bearing a power ring, so that they are two bodies acting as one), and \&quot;Strange Little Robots\&quot;. The \&quot;&#39;Frankenstein&#39;-inspired member\&quot; made a small appearance in the Sinestro Corps Special, appearing behind Sinestro. In the final installment of \&quot;The Sinestro Corps War\&quot;, many unnamed members were seen during the fight scenes. Two resembled a Xenomorph and a Predator. Another resembled the Legion of Super-Heroes villain Validus, and another was of the Dominator race.\n\n\n== Oath ==\nWhen recharging their power rings, members of the Sinestro Corps recite the following oath:\n\n:In blackest day, in brightest night,\nBeware your fears made into light\nLet those who try to stop what&#39;s right,\nBurn like my power(*)... Sinestro&#39;s might(**)!\n(*) \&quot;My power\&quot; becomes \&quot;his power\&quot; when recited by other members of the Corps.\n(**) \&quot;Sinestro&#39;s might\&quot; became for a time \&quot;Arkillo&#39;s might\&quot;, when Arkillo was the only active Sinestro Corps member prior to its rebirth.\n\n\n== Entity ==\n\nAs the embodiment of fear which is connected to the yellow light of the Emotional Spectrum, Parallax is revealed to be the emotional entity for the Sinestro Corps. Born when one of the earliest life forms first felt terror, it is insect-like in appearance. Parallax was the first of the seven entities to be captured by a still unknown person and currently is held captive in Ryut. The Sinestro Corps insignia is based on drawings created by life forms who looked into the mouth of Parallax, and lived to tell the tale.\n\n\n== Book of Parallax ==\nThis book apparently holds in its pages all the history of the greatest Sinestro Corpsmen histories. For unknown reasons the book was chained to Lyssa Drak with yellow energy from Sinestro himself. This was possibly for the need to have a historian for his Corps and a way for Sinestro to revisit his Corps&#39; success. Lyssa Drak is quite loyal to Sinestro and highly devoted to updating the Book and keeping it safe. A power ring is needed to translate the Book&#39;s text into words familiar to the ring wielder. Before a candidate of the corps enters a fear lodge, their power rings are drained by the Book of Parallax. Recently, Lyssa Drak has become the embodiment of the book.\n\n\n== Weapons and equipment ==\n\nMembers of the Sinestro Corps use yellow power rings built on Qward. Though functionally similar to a Green Lantern&#39;s power ring, yellow power rings are fueled by fear instead of willpower. Members are selected for their skill at intimidation and terror. The ring amplifies the aggressive tendencies of the wearer. The yellow rings are charged by yellow power batteries, which are in turn linked to a yellow Central Power Battery based on Korugar. Aside from the recharging limitations common among the various Corps, their only known weakness is that their power can be drained by a Blue Lantern&#39;s power ring.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nThe Sinestro Corps is featured in the Smallville Season 11 digital comic based on the TV series as creations of Parallax and the Manhunters serving as heralds. In \&quot;Lantern\&quot;, the Lanterns are activated by John Stewart (possessed by Parallax) and empower villains in Arkham Asylum, but are defeated by Superman and the remaining Corpsmen.  In the storyline \&quot;Chaos\&quot;, Lex Luthor uses his security equipped with Yellow Power Rings to destroy the Antarctica Supercollider owned by Bruce Wayne, Ted Kord and Michael Holt. They are defeated by Skeets and Booster Gold seizing their rings. \nThe Lightsmiths: In the universe prior to the current one, groups managed to tap into the wellspring of power created by the Emotional Spectrum. In this universe those who tapped into the yellow light were known as the Lightsmiths of the Yellow Light of Terror.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nIn Batman: The Brave and the Bold, an alternate universe version of Sinestro as a hero is presented on the Injustice Syndicate earth. He possess a slight variation of his Sinestro Corps uniform.\nThe Sinestro Corps appear in Justice League Action. Known members are Sinestro and Despotellis. In \&quot;The Ringer,\&quot; Sinestro was battling Hal Jordan while Despotellis was guarding the Sinestro Corps Battery in Sinestro&#39;s ring even when Superman, Wonder Woman, and Atom joined the fight. When Atom defeated Despotellis by changing his chemical structure, this shorted out Sinestro&#39;s ring, allowing Green Lantern to defeat Sinestro.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nIn the animated movie Green Lantern: First Flight, when Sinestro is given possession of the yellow power battery and ring, his Green Lantern uniform transforms into a uniform exactly the same as his Sinestro Corps uniform in the comics, complete with the same symbol. Aside from the uniform, however, there are subtle indications that Sinestro had the same plans for an organized military force.\nThe Sinestro Corps appear in Green Lantern: Emerald Knights as part of a prophecy that Atrocitus tells Abin Sur of. Besides Sinestro, several prominent members are featured: Arkillo, Lyssa Drak, Kryb, Maash, Karu-Sil, Romat-Ru, Slussh and Tri-eye.\nIn the 2011 film Green Lantern, allusions of the Sinestro Corps are evident. The Guardians detail a flashback featuring the rogue Guardian Krona approaching the Sinestro Corps symbol with the desire to conquer fear as a weapon. The closing scene of the film also features Sinestro putting on the newly crafted yellow ring, whereupon his uniform changes to that of the Sinestro Corps.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nThe members of the Sinestro Corps make a cameo appearance during Hal Jordan&#39;s ending depicted in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. They are shown battling the Green Lantern Corps for control of the Pyramid of Argus.\nThe Sinestro Corps appear in DC Universe Online. The rings of the Sinestro Corp have been experiencing malfunctions and they blame the Green Lanterns. Arkillo appears as a bounty for Heroes.\nIn the video game Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters, while the Sinestro Corps do not feature directly, the Manhunters acquire similar powers to the Sinestro Corps when they attempt to harness the power of the yellow energy kept contained by the Guardians to use as a weapon against the Green Lantern Corps.\nThe Sinestro Corps version of Batman is a playable skin in the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows version of Batman: Arkham City. The skin can be unlocked by using a code contained in the Blu-ray of the Green Lantern film (code only available for PS3), by purchasing the Arkham City Skins Pack which features all available skins (which is available for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. ), or by purchasing the \&quot;Game of The Year\&quot; edition of Arkham City. The costume is also available in Batman: Arkham City Armored Edition for the Nintendo Wii U.\nIn the parallel universe of Injustice: Gods Among Us, Hal Jordan has joined the Sinestro Corps in his role as enforcer for Superman&#39;s Regime, with Sinestro as another agent of the Regime. Hal\u2019s transformation into \&quot;Yellow Lantern\&quot; was a result of Sinestro playing him and framing Guy Gardner for John Stewart\u2019s death, whom Sinestro murdered behind Hal\u2019s back. When Superman is nearly killed by a kryptonite bullet fired by Black Canary, a yellow power ring finds him which he uses to remove the bullet. He then seemingly kills Canary while becoming a member of the Sinestro Corps. Nightwing, who in this reality is Damian Wayne, becomes a member of the Sinestro Corps in his Single Player ending.\nThe sequel game Injustice 2 reveals that Doctor Fate actually saved Canary from Sinestro\u2019s attack, and that she faked her death by sending her to another universe where she died instead of their universe\u2019s Green Arrow, until she and her son are brought back to their universe alongside the alternate Green Arrow, after Regime\u2019s defeat. In the prequel comics for the game, it is shown that, some time during his rehabilitation, Hal Jordan learned the truth behind John Stewart\u2019s death and, eneraged that he was manipulated by Sinestro into murdering Guy Gardner, attracts the Red Lantern Corps, who attempt to have him join their ranks. In Hal\u2019s ending, Sinestro escapes from his cell where he supposedly died during the Red Lanterns&#39; and Starro\u2019s attacks, forcing Hal to become a Yellow Lantern once again and go undercover to apprehend him, though he expresses his concerns that the ring\u2019s fear spectrum might take over his mind.\nThe Sinestro Corps appear in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. Sinestro and Arkillo are featured as playable characters, while Batman&#39;s Sinestro Corps uniform appears as a downloadable alternate skin for the character.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSinestro Corps at the Comic Book DB (archived from the original)\nWizard Article on the members of the Sinestro Corps\nNewsarama Sinestro Corp Preview&quot;</span>
