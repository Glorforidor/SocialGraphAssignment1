They were secretly led by [[U.S. Senator]] Sanders Hotchkins. When several noted chemists began disappearing, they drew the [[FBI]]&#39;s attention. The FBI contacted Hannibal Martin, the Justice League Task Force&#39;s liaison, and the [[Martian Manhunter]] assembled a covert team to infiltrate the terrorists. While undercover, [[Hourman]] was forced to use his powers and drew the attention of the Aryan Nation&#39;s superhuman enforcers who call themselves the Aryan Brigade. Thanks to Blind Faith&#39;s mental powers, the Aryan Brigade was able to uncover and surprise the Task Force. They captured all but Hourman who returned to free them. In the meantime, the Nation had readied its virus for delivery into the atmosphere. J&#39;onn followed the rocket and forced it to detonate in space. All members of the organization were subsequently arrested.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League Task Force&#39;&#39; #10. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFollowing this, the Aryan Brigade&#39;s members were recruited by the [[Overmaster]] to be part of his new [[Cadre (comics)|Cadre]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt; Golden Eagle II and Heatmonger popped up in one of the incarnations of the [[Suicide Squad]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Files &amp; Origins To The DCU 2000&#39;&#39; #1.

Lucious Coolidge, nicknamed Heat Monger, is a criminal and arsonist in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] and an enemy of the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Wally West|Kid Flash]]. Coolidge became known as Central City&#39;s most notorious arsonist ever since [[Mick Rory]] \&quot;[[Legends of Tomorrow|went off the grid]]\&quot;. At some point, he was defeated by the Flash and arrested by the Central City Police Department. At Coolidge&#39;s trial, he glared at [[Cisco Ramon]] and [[Doctor Alchemy|Julian Albert]] when they made fun of his codename. Cecille Horton was the prosecution in his case. Barry went up to testify, but unknown to Judge Hankerson and Coolidge, Barry had lost all of his memories. As such, he botched the testimony and Judge Hankerson allowed Coolidge to walk. Upon his release, Coolidge was back to his old tricks, setting fire to a large office building. However, he was defeated by Barry (who had recently regained his memories) and Kid Flash. Heat Monger was arrested again.\n\n===Film===\nIron Cross, Heatmonger and Backlash were reportedly featured in [[David S. Goyer]]&#39;s script for an upcoming [[Green Arrow]] film project entitled &#39;&#39;[[Green Arrow in other media#Escape from Super Max|Escape from Super Max]]&#39;&#39;.
