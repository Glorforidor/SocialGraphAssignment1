It extends the Marvel 2099 imprint, which features other future versions of popular Marvel characters, such as Spider-Man 2099 and Hulk 2099. The series was written by John Francis Moore and largely pencilled by Ron Lim.\nThe series began in October 1993 and lasted 35 issues along with two specials. It spawned a line of action figures, mostly featuring the more popular characters in the book. In issue #20, the title received a minor makeover, officially joining the 2099 imprint and changing its name to X-Men 2099 A.D., the \"A.D.\" standing for \"After Doom\". At the series' end, it was folded into 2099: World of Tomorrow, though members of the team were rarely seen after that point.\nThe first issue featured a blue foil cover on cardstock and the double-sized 25th issue's cover was extra-glossy with foil letters, metallic silver ink, and embossed characters on a heavier wraparound cover.\nIn June 2009, a mini-series called Timestorm 2009\u20132099 brought back Spider-Man, Ghost Rider, the X-Men, and more from the 2099 universe in a very different version.In 2016, the original version returned in the Spider Man 2099 arc \"Civil War 2099\" (also appearing in X-Men '92 series).\nLater the team appeared again in X-Men Blue, helping the original time displaced X-Men.\n\n\n== Roster ==\nThe team featured an ever-changing line-up, but the mainstays included:\n\nDesert Ghost (Xi'an Chi Xan) \u2013 Founder.
