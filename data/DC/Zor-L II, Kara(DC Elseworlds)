Originally hailing from the world of [[Earth-Two]], first envisioned as the home of DC&#39;s wartime heroes as published in 1940s comic books, Power Girl becomes stranded in the [[DC Universe|main universe]] where DC stories are set, and becomes acquainted with that world&#39;s Superman and her own counterpart, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]].\n\nIn common with Supergirl&#39;s origin story, she is the daughter of Superman&#39;s [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Alura|aunt]] and [[Zor-El|uncle]] and a native of the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Greenberger |first=Robert |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=315-317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infant Power Girl&#39;s parents enabled her to escape the destruction of her home planet by placing her in a rocket ship. Although she left the planet at the same time that Superman did, her ship took much longer to reach Earth-Two. On Earth, as with other Kryptonians, Power Girl discovered she possessed abilities like super strength, flight, and heat vision, using which she became a protector of innocents and a hero for humanity. Though the specifics of how vary over subsequent retellings, Power Girl is later stranded on another Earth when a cosmic crisis affects her home of Earth-Two, and later carves out a separate identity for herself from her dimensional counterpart Supergirl once they are forced to coexist.\n\nThough they are biologically the same person, Power Girl behaves as an older, more mature, and more level-headed version of Supergirl, with a more aggressive fighting style. She also adopts a different secret identity from her counterpart. These changes are reflected in their differing costumes and superhero names as well; Power Girl sports a [[bob cut|bob]] of blond hair; wears a distinctive white, red, and blue costume with a [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]-displaying cutout. The name Power Girl reflects that she chooses not to be seen as a derivative of Superman, but rather her own hero and this choice is reflected in the strong independent attitude of the character. Over various decades, Power Girl has been depicted as a member of superhero teams such as the [[Justice Society of America]], [[Infinity, Inc.]], [[Justice League Europe]], and the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]].\n\nPower Girl&#39;s origin has gone through revisions, but over time has reverted to her original conception as the Supergirl of Earth-Two. The 1985 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; eliminated Earth-Two from history, causing her to be [[retcon]]ned as the granddaughter of an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] known as [[Arion (comics)|Arion]]. This was an unpopular change and writers depicted the revised Power Girl inconsistently. The 2005\u20132006 &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; limited series then restored her status as a refugee from the Krypton of the destroyed [[Pre-Crisis]] Earth-Two universe. Following DC&#39;s 2011 \&quot;[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\&quot; storyline and [[New 52]] reboot, Power Girl&#39;s origin was retold as the Supergirl of \&quot;Earth 2\&quot;, cousin and adopted daughter of Superman, who during evil [[Jack Kirby&#39;s Fourth World|Fourth World]] [[New Gods|New God]] [[Darkseid]]&#39;s invasion of Earth 2 becomes stranded in the main continuity of Earth 0, subsequently adopting the name Power Girl to hide her true identity. She returned to her source Earth in the story &#39;&#39;Earth 2: World&#39;s End&#39;&#39; (2014\u20132015).\n\n==Publication history==\nPower Girl was introduced in &#39;&#39;[[All Star Comics]]&#39;&#39; #58 in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McAvennie |first=Michael |title=DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle |last2=Dolan |first2=Hannah, ed. |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-7566-6742-9 |page=169 |chapter=1970s |quote=Along with artist Ric Estrada, [Gerry] Conway also introduced the DC Universe to the cousin of Earth-2&#39;s Superman, Kara Zor-L a.k.a.

[[Marvel Comics]]&#39; then-publisher [[Stan Lee]] said in 1978 that when [[DC Comics]] created Power Girl after Marvel had introduced [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], \&quot;I&#39;m pretty annoyed about that. ...I&#39;ve got to ask the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] lawyer \u2013 she&#39;s supposed to be starting a lawsuit about that and I haven&#39;t heard anything. I don&#39;t like the idea. ... You know, years ago we brought out [[Wonder Man]], and [DC Comics] sued us because they had [[Wonder Woman]], and ... I said okay, I&#39;ll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they&#39;ve got Power Girl. Oh, boy. How unfair.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Hello, Culture Lovers: Stan the Map Raps with Marvel Maniacs at [[James Madison University]]\&quot;, &#39;&#39;[[The Comics Journal]]&#39;&#39; #42, October 1978, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Marvel had previously published &#39;&#39;[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]&#39;&#39; #207, written by Power Girl co-creator [[Gerry Conway]], in which [[Len Wein]]&#39;s character says, \&quot;Whoever heard of Powergirl, anyhow?\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Issue #207 \u2014 released January 1973&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter &#39;&#39;All Star Comics&#39;&#39; was canceled as a part of the [[DC Implosion]], the character would continue to appear along with the rest of the JSA in &#39;&#39;[[Adventure Comics]]&#39;&#39; for a six-issue run. Due in part to her being one of the more popular characters in &#39;&#39;All Star Comics&#39;&#39; at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Dan |date=April 2014 |title=Showcase Presents...

During this time, she was a regularly featured character in the annual Justice Society crossovers in the original &#39;&#39;Justice League of America&#39;&#39; series. She was a founding member of &#39;&#39;[[Infinity Inc.]]&#39;&#39;, appearing in each of the first 12 issues and making later guest appearances.\n\nAfter DC&#39;s continuity-altering &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; storyline, her origin was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] in &#39;&#39;Secret Origins&#39;&#39; vol. 2, #11 and she became a magic-based character with ties to ancient Atlantis, leading to appearances in &#39;&#39;[[Warlord (DC Comics)|The Warlord]]&#39;&#39;. The character did not receive her own self-titled series until the &#39;&#39;Power Girl&#39;&#39; miniseries of 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=797 The Comic Book Database] \u2013 Power Girl (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The character became a featured member of &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Europe]]&#39;&#39; (a spin off from &#39;&#39;Justice League International&#39;&#39;) for the run of the series.

Although this occurs at the same time that Kal-L&#39;s&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE THE REAL NAME. \&quot;Kal-L\&quot; is correct in this case, per DC standards; it refers to the Superman of Earth-2, where the Kryptonian names use the letter, not the \&quot;El\&quot; expansion.--&gt; ship is launched, Kara&#39;s ship travels more slowly, and she arrives on Earth decades after her cousin has landed. Kara\u2019s Symbioship is designed to keep her in stasis during the journey and provide her with life experiences and education in the form of [[virtual reality]]. The Symbioship allows her to interact with virtual copies of her parents and fellow Kryptonians. Originally, by the time she arrives on Earth, Kara is shown to be in her early twenties. However, as mentioned in &#39;&#39;JSA Classified&#39;&#39; #1, her age at arrival has now been [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] to about eighteen in post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; continuity.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; #97, Kara is reclaimed by the sentient Symbioship and reimmersed into Kandorian society for a time. Several years of virtual time elapse, in which Kara is married and has a child. She is freed with the assistance of newspaper reporter Andrew Vinson, at which point she disables the ship.\n\n===Debut===\nPower Girl&#39;s existence is not revealed to the general public until much later; her cousin [[Clark Kent|Clark]] and his wife [[Lois Lane#Golden Age|Lois Lane]] provide her a family environment to assist her transition towards real life relationships. In her first recorded adventure, Kara assists Justice Society members [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]] and [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]] with containing an artificially induced volcanic eruption in China. She then joins Robin and [[Star-Spangled Kid]] to form a Super Squad to assist the Justice Society in defeating [[Brainwave (comics)|Brainwave]] and [[Per Degaton]], who were causing disasters around the world. She pushes their base towards the [[Sun]], the heat causing the villains to fall unconscious. Later, she becomes a full member of the Society when Superman retires from active membership.\n\nHaving been raised by the Symbioship with artificial Kryptonian life experiences, Power Girl finds it difficult to adapt to life on Earth. However, with the help of reporter Andrew Vinson, she adopts the [[secret identity]] of computer [[programmer]] Karen Starr (she obtains her knowledge in this field from exposure to [[Wonder Woman]]&#39;s [[Purple Ray]] on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]). On the pre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Earth-Two, Power Girl&#39;s closest friend is the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]], the daughter of the Earth-Two [[Batman]] and [[Catwoman]].\n\nThe first contact between Power Girl and [[Earth-One]]&#39;s universe was on the [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] &#39;&#39;Justice League of America #147&#39;&#39;, written by [[Paul Levitz]] &amp; [[Martin Pasko]], where the character shows her attraction to that reality saying, \&quot;It has a much nicer brand of Superman, y&#39;know?\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Justice League of America]]&#39;&#39; #147 (October 1977): \&quot;Crisis in the 30th Century!\&quot;. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Atlantean===\nThe 1985 &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; limited series erased the existence of the Earth-Two Superman, and Power Girl&#39;s [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] was thus substantially disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Crisis on Infinite Earths&#39;&#39; #11. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially she believed herself to be Superman&#39;s cousin, as she had been before the [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. However, her background was [[retroactive continuity|retconned]]; she was told that she was the descendant of the [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] sorcerer [[Arion (comics)|Arion]], and was frozen in [[suspended animation]] for millennia until the present day.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Secret Origins]]&#39;&#39; #11. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter the [[Justice Society]] disbands, Power Girl would join the [[Justice League]]. Later, while a member of [[Justice League Europe]], she suffers a near fatal injury while battling a mystical being. Superman must assist in her medical treatment, using his heat-vision to perform surgery on her otherwise-invulnerable tissues.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League Europe #9&#39;&#39; (December 1989). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Although she recovers, Power Girl is significantly weaker, as she lost her vision powers and could not fly for a time. However, she regained them all as time went on. Power Girl adopts a one-eyed mangy cat, an animal which would affect much of the team. One aspect of this is her beloved cat is used to spy on the group by intelligence gathering criminals.&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Justice League Europe Annual\&quot; #2 (1991). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the 1994 &#39;&#39;[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]&#39;&#39; event, Power Girl experiences a [[Miraculous births|mystical pregnancy]]&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League International #52&#39;&#39; (July 1993).

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[DC Universe|DCU]].\n\nPower Girl appeared in later issues of the &#39;&#39;[[Sovereign Seven]]&#39;&#39; series, [[Chris Claremont]]&#39;s creator-owned comic book for DC.&lt;ref&gt;Sovereign Seven #25 (May 1997). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the final issue revealed that the entire series had been a story appearing in a comic book, and events in the book have had no bearing upon DC continuity.\n\nPower Girl was one of [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle\u2019s]] first [[Birds of Prey (comics)|agents]]. Their short-lived partnership ended after a disastrous mission which resulted in a large loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Birds of Prey #42&#39;&#39; (June 2002). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Power Girl believes that Oracle&#39;s poor leadership was responsible for the tragedy, being disgusted that Oracle would sacrifice hundreds of lives &amp; herself following orders. Although she has worked with her again on a few occasions when needed, the relationship between the two is tense. In &#39;&#39;Birds of Prey&#39;&#39; #35, Power Girl admitted that she is primarily to blame for the tension, but is unable to overcome the memories of the deaths.\n\nPower Girl is a key member of the Justice Society, which she joined when it was reformed in the late 1990s. During an adventure with the JSA, she meets Arion, who reveals her Atlantean heritage to be a lie he concocted at the behest of Power Girl&#39;s \&quot;mother\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;JSA&#39;&#39; #50 (September 2003). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhile attempting to save her teammate [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Ted Grant]] from the new female [[Crimson Avenger]], Power Girl is severely wounded by supernatural bullets fired from the vigilante&#39;s cursed handguns. Despite being saved by [[Doctor Mid-Nite]], Power Girl comments that her near-death experience has shown her that she needs to make more personal connections outside of the superhero community.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Infinite Crisis&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\n\n====&#39;&#39;JSA Classified: Power Trip&#39;&#39;====\n[[File:Power Girl Amanda Conner.png|thumb|Power Girl, from [[Justice Society of America#JSA: Classified|&#39;&#39;JSA Classified&#39;&#39;]] #1 (Sept. 2005).

Kal-L also reiterates her [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39;]] history as his cousin. A touch from the ailing [[Lois Lane#Golden Age|Lois of Earth-Two]] inexplicably restores Power Girl&#39;s memories of [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39;]] Earth-Two.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinite Crisis&#39;&#39; #2, &#39;&#39;JSA&#39;&#39; #82 (2006).

A violent confrontation between the two Supermen ensues, at the end of which Kal-L comes to the realization that this created Earth-Two had not been a perfect world, since \&quot;a perfect earth doesn&#39;t need a Superman.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinite Crisis&#39;&#39; #5, (2006).

Tanya Spears tries to get Karen Starr out by using an etheric transponder that allows her to travel there in an incorporeal state, but her physical body was disconnected from the machine by an unaware [[Wallace West (character)|Kid Flash (Wallace West)]], so both women remain trapped as a result.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Deathstroke Annual&#39;&#39; #1 (March 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the \&quot;[[Watchmen]]\&quot; sequel \&quot;[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]],\&quot; Power Girl returns to the DC Universe when [[Doctor Manhattan]], inspired by [[Superman]], undoes the changes that he made to the timeline that erase the Justice Society and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Doomsday Clock&#39;&#39; #12 (February 2020). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nShe can be seen talking with [[Blue Beetle]] on the background alongside with Supergirl.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lanterns&#39;&#39; #40 (February 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs the biological cousin of Superman, Power Girl exhibits all of the classic [[Kryptonian]] powers: super strength; flight; super speed; invulnerability; x-ray, telescopic, microscopic and heat vision; freeze breath; and super-hearing. Over the years various writers have given Power Girl&#39;s Kryptonian power differing levels, reflecting the lower powers of the Earth-Two Superman [[Kal-L]]. For example, Power Girl can fly through space, but has to breathe, so before she leaves a planet, she must take a deep breath and hold it for several hours until she needs a new oxygen source. Power Girl needs to sleep or she will experience disorientation due to fatigue. However, as recently shown in \&quot;[[Brightest Day]]\&quot;, she now draws her superpowers from yellow sunlight, just like Superman. The reason for this change has not yet been explained.\n\nSince she is from an alternative universe (pre-Crisis [[Earth Two]]), kryptonite has no effect on her, but she is still vulnerable to magic. As Karen Starr, she is an accomplished business woman and is regarded by Mr. Terrific as a first rate scientist. Even though Power Girl is from an alternative universe, her biology is still similar to Superman&#39;s. As one of a handful of characters who survived the &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39;, DC editorial was initially uncertain how to portray the character and attempted to portray Power Girl with a non-Kryptonian origin for a number of years. Power Girl&#39;s abilities have fluctuated since 1986. For some time, Power Girl believed she was an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;IC2\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinite Crisis&#39;&#39; #2&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Power Girl possessed [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]];&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Birds of Prey&#39;&#39; #42&lt;/ref&gt; at another she was vulnerable to attacks by certain natural elements (for example, wooden weapons).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Supergirl&#39;&#39; #16 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; After sustaining severe injuries from a magic attack Power Girl retained only a degree of super strength, speed and durability.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League Europe&#39;&#39; #9 (1989)&lt;!--month needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, she later recovered her ability to fly, and writers have gradually restored her superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; #31 (2002)&lt;!--month needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Physical appearance and costumes==\nPower Girl&#39;s original [[Wally Wood]] artwork (1976) showed her as relatively busty but otherwise her [[BWH|figure and build]] conformed in appearance to other contemporary comic book women. However, in &#39;&#39;[[Wonder Woman]]&#39;&#39; #34 (2009), written by [[Gail Simone]], Dinah Lance, the [[Black Canary]], mentions Power Girl as having the top bosom of [[DC Universe|DCU]], comparing her assets with a \&quot;national treasure\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #34 (September 2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Her most common outfit is a leg-baring, figure-hugging, long-sleeved white leotard with a keyhole cut-out opening in the chest.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;All-Star Comics&#39;&#39; #58 (January\u2013February 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAccording to character writer [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], \&quot;Okay. When the character was created, Wally Wood was the artist that drew Power Girl, and he was convinced that the editors were not paying attention to anything he did. So, his inker said every issue I\u2019m going to draw the tits bigger until they notice it. It took about seven or eight issues before anyone was like hey, what\u2019s with the tits? And that\u2019s where they stopped. True story.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Karyn Pinter |title=Jimmy Palmiotti: Time Bomb and Power Girl - the Breast of Friends? - Comics Bulletin |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3318/jimmy-palmiotti-time-bomb-and-power-girl-the-breast-of-friends/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722211125/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/interviews/3318/jimmy-palmiotti-time-bomb-and-power-girl-the-breast-of-friends/ |archive-date=2014-07-22 |access-date=2014-05-10 |website=Comics Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nPower Girl was at one time portrayed as having a highly athletic but slender physique.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Who\u2019s Who in the DC Universe&#39;&#39; #18 (August 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Artists [[Bart Sears]] (in the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Europe]]&#39;&#39; series), and later [[Alex Ross]] (in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] &#39;&#39;[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]&#39;&#39;) restored Power Girl&#39;s well-endowed shape. Ross rendered her as a heavily muscled &#39;&#39;Power Woman&#39;&#39; (as if she was an ardent [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilder]]).\n\nThe character is consistently depicted as a large breasted young woman, and her physique is one of her most recognizable attributes \u2013 to the extent that various writers have acknowledged it in both serious and humorous ways.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Girl&#39;&#39; #1, May 2009 Page 12 and 17. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeph Loeb]]. &#39;&#39;[[Superman/Batman]]&#39;&#39; #6 (March 2004) Page 3. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFor example, &#39;&#39;Justice League Europe&#39;&#39; #37 (1992) attempts to explain Power Girl&#39;s revealing costume by having [[Crimson Fox]] question her about it; she receives the reply that the costume \&quot;shows what I am: female, healthy. If men want to degrade themselves by staring, that&#39;s their problem, I&#39;m not going to apologize for it.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League Europe&#39;&#39; #37 (April 1992). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nConversely, in &#39;&#39;JSA: Classified&#39;&#39; #2 (2005), writer [[Geoff Johns]] has Power Girl explain her cleavage-window to Superman, revealing that \&quot;the first time I made this costume, I wanted to have a symbol, like you. I just\u2026I couldn\u2019t think of anything. I thought eventually, I\u2019d figure it out. And close the hole. But I haven\u2019t.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;JSA: Classified&#39;&#39; #2 (October 2005). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar treatment of the character can be seen in &#39;&#39;Superman/Batman&#39;&#39; #4 (written by [[Jeph Loeb]]), in which the heroes need to distract the [[Toyman#Hiro Okamura|Toyman]] while Batman and Superman battle [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Hawkman]]. Batman suggests that Power Girl&#39;s endowments would be likely to distract Toyman, a 13-year-old boy. Toyman later attempts to make a reference to the size of her chest before being cut off by Superman.&lt;ref&gt;Jeph Loeb. &#39;&#39;Superman/Batman&#39;&#39; #4 (January 2004). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this joke is included in the &#39;&#39;[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]&#39;&#39; movie.&lt;ref&gt;Warner Premiere, &#39;&#39;[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]&#39;&#39;, Warner Home Video (2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nPower Girl&#39;s costume design has varied greatly over the years. Her classic costume design from &#39;&#39;All-Star Comics&#39;&#39; #58 is that which is in use today: a red cape and belt, blue gloves and boots, and a white [[bodysuit]] sporting a circular [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]-exposing cut-out on her chest (its variable size and shape determined by the artist depicting her).  According to [[Gerry Conway]], \&quot;The true, dumb reason for the circle? At the time, it was a convention for hero costumes to have a chest symbol. I thought a giant &#39;P&#39; looked silly. The circle was intended as a nod to convention without being conventional. Not a sexy thing at all, until Wally Wood\u2019s inks.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Conway |first=Gerry |authorlink=Gerry Conway |date=2 January 2020 |title=The true, dumb reason for the circle?... |url=https://twitter.com/gerryconway/status/1212830266625904640 |access-date=5 January 2020 |website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This window was closed for the first time in &#39;&#39;All-Star Comics&#39;&#39; #64, pencilled by Wood.&lt;ref&gt;All-Star Comics #64, Cover (February 1977).

In a guest appearance in &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern]]&#39;&#39;, Kara is seen in her large wardrobe closet with every costume design she has ever worn in DC continuity, deciding which costume to wear for that mission.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern and Power Girl&#39;&#39; one-shot (October 2000), part of the \&quot;[[Green Lantern: Circle of Fire|Circle of Fire]]\&quot; story arc&lt;/ref&gt; Her original costume returned when Johns and [[David Goyer]] had her rejoin the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceA\&quot; /&gt;\n\nIn &#39;&#39;Justice League: Generation Lost&#39;&#39; #16, she sports a variation of her traditional costume that includes pants.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League: Generation Lost&#39;&#39; #16 (Late February 2011). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAs part of DC&#39;s 2011 reboot of its continuity, [[The New 52]], Power Girl was reintroduced into the DC Universe as first being the Earth-2 Supergirl, where she wears a variation of the traditional Supergirl costume designed by Kevin Maguire that features red gloves and belt, and a new S-shield, identical to the new Earth 2 Superman&#39;s, and has a cape that attaches directly to the shield. However, some aspects of her continuity were retained: she was still adopted by Clark Kent and Lois Lane, married on Earth 2 before their deaths and still uses the secret identity of software entrepreneur Karen Starr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=James Robinson |penciller=Nicola Scott |inker=Trevor Scott |story=The Price of Victory |title=Earth 2 |issue=1 |date=July 2012 |publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some time passes, she decides to take on a new identity as she is now trapped on the mainstream DC Earth.

DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Other versions==\n{{See also|Alternative versions of Supergirl}}\n* The first use of the name Power Girl was a story in &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #125 (1958). In this story, [[Lois Lane]] has a dream where she is a superhero named Power Girl who is constantly coming to the aid of a bumbling [[Clark Kent]] whom she dreams as a superhero named Power Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Carol Strickland&#39;s Power Girl Index |url=http://carolastrickland.com/comics/powergirl/index.html |access-date=2011-01-30 |publisher=Carolastrickland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In &#39;&#39;Power Girl&#39;&#39; #23 (June 2011), Power Girl adopts this incarnation&#39;s red wig disguise for her Karen Starr identity (along with glasses), after being advised by Superman to make Karen a real person, not just a costume.\n* In the final issue of &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39; (2007), a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] is formed, consisting of 52 [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel realities]]. As a result of [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]] \&quot;eating\&quot; aspects of these realities, their histories are modified, and one takes on aspects of the pre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Earth-Two. This reality listed as \&quot;Earth-2\&quot; has its own Power Girl who has spent years in space searching for her long lost cousin Superman. As shown in several issues of &#39;&#39;Justice Society&#39;&#39; (Vol 3 Annual 1 (2008) and issues 18\u201325), the mainstream Power Girl was sent to Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Earth-2 by Gog and was briefly confused to be the Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Earth-2 Power Girl by its native heroes. Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Earth-2 Power Girl returned to her source Earth and battled the mainstream Power Girl as she regarded the mainstream Power Girl to be an imposter who caused the disappearance of her source Earth Superman who she had been searching unsuccessfully for years off-world. Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Earth-2 Power Girl wears the original Power Girl costume and shows herself to be arrogant to the point of being unbalanced, and is overtly aggressive as shown when she openly tortured the mainstream Power Girl almost to the point of killing her as well as directly attacking the Earth-22 Superman. The two Power Girls parted with no apologies given for the torture. Starman stated that the mainstream Power Girl will have important interactions with the Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Earth-2 heroes including the Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Earth-2 Power Girl at some points in the future (&#39;&#39;Justice Society&#39;&#39; Vol 3 #25), despite the obvious disregard the Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Earth-2 Power Girl has for the mainstream Power Girl. The Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Earth-2 Power Girl has not reappeared since this storyline concluded.\n* In the [[Tangent Comics]] imprint, Power Girl is a vastly powered [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] superhero created by the Chinese government. This Power Girl is of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent and is married to that reality&#39;s [[Tangent Comics#Superman|Superman]] who is an [[African American]] man with vast [[psionics|psionic]] powers. This powerful couple have conquered the Earth in the reality of [[Earth-9]].\n* The &#39;&#39;[[JLA: Another Nail]]&#39;&#39; [[graphic novel]] features a Power Girl who is an ally of that reality&#39;s [[Black Canary]] and [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]]. Though visually identical to her Earth-2 counterpart, her relationship to Superman or if she is even a Kryptonian at all is never mentioned in the story.\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]&#39;&#39;, Power Girl is renamed Power Woman, and assists [[Superman]] in reforming the [[Justice League]].\n* In &#39;&#39;[[JLA: Created Equal]]&#39;&#39;, Power Girl is a member of the Justice League. She has a daughter of her own, Kara Zor-L II.\n* A version of Power Girl appeared in &#39;&#39;Justice League International&#39;&#39; Annual #5, &#39;&#39;No Rules to Follow&#39;&#39;. This version of Kara has no memory of where she came from before she arrived on Earth. As part of a team of ten revealed metahumans, she sides with the heroes who go into hiding.\n* Karen, now stripped of her powers thanks to the [[Obsidian (comics)|Great Darkness Engine]], appeared as a prisoner of [[Kid Karnevil]]&#39;s [[Neo-Nazi]] regime shown in the &#39;&#39;Fatherland&#39;&#39; storyline depicted in &#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; #37\u201340. She is portrayed as one of the world&#39;s few living surviving superheroes, with most of her comrades having been executed.\n* An elderly, grotesque and blind version of Power Girl, known as Old Karrie, appeared in an alternative timeline depicted in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]&#39;&#39;. Set in 2351, she is stated to be the sole survivor of a violent metahuman war instigated by [[Maxwell Lord]]. According to Karrie, even the immortal metahumans were killed in the war. She also claimed to have lost her powers, as a result of [[kryptonite]]. She is still somehow alive, after more than 300 years, without powers, food or even sleep.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League: Generation Lost&#39;&#39; #6. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Another future Power Girl appears later in the series, fighting alongside a future incarnation of the Justice League. When [[Captain Atom]] is once again sent into the future, he meets an older Kara Zor-L, with white hair. She has abandoned her classical white bodysuit for a black one, with bracelets (similar to [[Wonder Woman]]&#39;s) &amp; [[Superman logo|Superman&#39;s S-shield]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Justice League: Generation Lost&#39;&#39; #14. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* In the Ame-Comi line, Power Girl is that universe&#39;s equivalent of Superman. She is Kara Jor-El, daughter of Jor-El, cousin of Supergirl, and the primary protector of Metropolis. She makes no efforts to maintain a secret identity, and uses her corporation to utilize Kryptonian technology for the betterment of mankind. This version of Power Girl, unusually for most depictions of Kryptonians, doesn&#39;t get her powers from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ame-Comi: Power Girl&#39;&#39; #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* A red haired version of Power Girl is seen amongst the agents employed by Monarch in the battle on Earth-51 during &#39;&#39;[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39;. This version appears to be Kryptonian as she is shown to be susceptible to kryptonite and is slain by that world&#39;s version of Batman. Nothing is known about her personality or powers as she is seen only in a few panels and appears to be fully under Monarch&#39;s control and arrogantly describes Batman as being \&quot;just a human\&quot;. It is the only line she speaks before being slain.\n* In the &#39;&#39;[[DC Comics Bombshells]]&#39;&#39; universe, Power Girl was cloned from Supergirl&#39;s DNA by [[Hugo Strange]] during the [[Siege of Leningrad]], and was forced by her master to fight Supergirl until the latter convinces her to turn on Strange. She escapes the facility beneath the [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] thanks to the assistance of Supergirl and another superhuman clone whom she treated like a brother, Superman.\n* During the 2011 relaunch of DC Comics&#39; entire superhero line known as &#39;&#39;[[The New 52]]&#39;&#39;, Karen Starr appears in the &#39;&#39;[[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]]&#39;&#39; series as a friend of the titular hero, with whom she has a [[casual relationship]]. In the series, Starr is still the head of Starr Enterprises, which was financed by her comrade in arms [[Helena Wayne]] ([[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]]) after the latter hacked into Wayne Enterprises accounts. From a software design and development corporation, Starr Enterprises now purchases intellectual property and technology with possible interdimensional access capabilities so that the two women can return home.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mister Terrific&#39;&#39; #1 (September 2011). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Power Girl subsequently stars in a new ongoing series, &#39;&#39;[[Worlds&#39; Finest]]&#39;&#39;, which premiered in May 2012. In the new continuity both she and Huntress, with whom she is partnered, are from [[Earth-Two|Earth 2]] but were flung into the Prime Earth&#39;s universe by an interdimensional vortex of unknown origin during the closing stages of an invasion from [[Apokolips]]-2 which took the life of Earth-2&#39;s [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman]], [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Batman]], and [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Rogers |first=Vaneta |date=January 13, 2012 |title=Paul Levitz Explains More About Worlds&#39; Finest, Earth 2 |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/paul-levitz-worlds-finest-earth-2-120113.html |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/653oQcFwB?url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/paul-levitz-worlds-finest-earth-2-120113.html |archive-date=January 29, 2012 |access-date=January 29, 2012 |publisher=[[Newsarama]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Josh Kushins |date=2012-01-12 |title=DC COMICS IN 2012 \u2013 INTRODUCING THE &#39;SECOND WAVE OF DC COMICS-THE NEW 52 |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2012/01/12/dc-comics-in-2012-%E2%80%93-introducing-the-%E2%80%9Csecond-wave%E2%80%9D-of-dc-comics-the-new-52/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/64hEz5q0J?url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2012/01/12/dc-comics-in-2012-%E2%80%93-introducing-the-%E2%80%9Csecond-wave%E2%80%9D-of-dc-comics-the-new-52/ |archive-date=2012-01-14 |access-date=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also revealed that prior to adopting the alias of Power Girl, she functioned as Earth 2&#39;s Supergirl and, in stark contrast to the Supergirl of Prime Earth, Karen loves her adopted Earth with a passion and was accepted with open arms by an adoring public.

A temporarily amnesiac Power Girl from a seemingly alternative reality (not Earth 2, but more reminiscent of the pre-New 52 Power Girl) crashes in Harley Quinn&#39;s reality as shown in [[Harley Quinn]] (2013-) storyline \&quot;Power Outage\&quot; (Issues #10-13).  Some of the missing time from this joint encounter was explored in the 6-issue mini-series [[Harley Quinn and Power Girl]] (2015). Due to an attack by some evil aliens she got knocked back to Earth and landed at Harley Quinn&#39;s feet, devoid of memories. Harley temporarily took her on as a partner and they fought crime together before being sent across the universe on a quest to return home. When Power Girl got her memories back and realized that Harley had lied to her, she was less than amused, but forgave her. However when Harley hit on her, Power Girl left her atop the Eiffel Tower. Power Girl has reappeared in Harley Quinn&#39;s ongoing series several times since and has recently taken Terra/Altee on as her sidekick/partner.\n\n==Collected editions==\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Power Girl&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; (collects &#39;&#39;JSA Classified&#39;&#39; #1-4, &#39;&#39;Showcase&#39;&#39; #97-99 and &#39;&#39;Secret Origins&#39;&#39; #11)\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Power Girl: A New Beginning&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; (collects &#39;&#39;Power Girl&#39;&#39; #1\u20136)\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Power Girl: Aliens and Apes&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; (collects &#39;&#39;Power Girl&#39;&#39; #7\u201312)\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Power Girl: Bomb Squad&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; (collects &#39;&#39;Power Girl&#39;&#39; #13\u201318)\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Power Girl: Old Friends&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; (collects &#39;&#39;Power Girl&#39;&#39; #19\u201327)\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Power Girl: Power Trip&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; (collects &#39;&#39;JSA Classified&#39;&#39; #1\u20134 and &#39;&#39;Power Girl&#39;&#39; #1\u201312)\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Although Power Girl did not directly appear in the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]&#39;&#39; animated series or the follow-up, &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39;, the &#39;&#39;JLU&#39;&#39; character &#39;&#39;&#39;Galatea&#39;&#39;&#39; (voiced by [[Nicholle Tom]]) is based on her. This character is a [[cloning|clone]] of [[Supergirl]] (also voiced by Tom) created by [[Emil Hamilton]] (who sees her as a [[daughter]], while she sees him as a [[father figure]]) from [[Project Cadmus]] as a contingency plan in case the Justice League turned against the US. Although the clone resembles Power Girl and wears a similar hairstyle and costume (at one point, she briefly drapes a red workout towel over her shoulder, resembling the half-cape of her comic book counterpart), her personality and origin are significantly different, being a supervillain who seeks the League&#39;s destruction. She also possesses a mental link with Supergirl, allowing them to experience each other&#39;s recent memories in the form of dreams. Galatea first appears in the [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 1: 2004\u20132005|first season&#39;s sixth episode, \&quot;Fearful Symmetry.\&quot;]] She subsequently appears at the end of [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 2: 2005|season 2&#39;s \&quot;Flashpoint\&quot;]], and she is last seen in [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 2: 2005|season 2&#39;s \&quot;Panic in the Sky\&quot;]]. In her last appearance, \&quot;Panic in the Sky\&quot;, she fights Supergirl for control of the [[JLA Watchtower|Watchtower]]. She is defeated by Supergirl, who traps her in a contact, causing all of the Watchtower&#39;s power to flow through her, causing an overload. Following the massive surge of electricity, she is left twitching and catatonic; it is unknown whether she ultimately survives. Conversely, this continuity&#39;s Supergirl borrows several elements from Power Girl, such as having been in suspended animation (which had not been introduced in the Kara Zor-El mythology at that point) and being a surrogate cousin of Kal-El rather than a biological relative. Also, in her first appearance, in &#39;&#39;[[Superman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39;, when she first meets [[Jimmy Olsen]], she&#39;s without a disguise and tells him that her name is \&quot;Karen\&quot;.\n* &#39;&#39;[[Smallville]]&#39;&#39;\n** In the &#39;&#39;Smallville&#39;&#39; [[Smallville (season 2)|season 2]] episode \&quot;Visage\&quot;, [[Chloe Sullivan]] identifies &#39;&#39;&#39;Tina Greer&#39;&#39;&#39; ([[Lizzy Caplan]]) by the moniker \&quot;Power Girl\&quot;.\n** In the &#39;&#39;Smallville&#39;&#39; [[Smallville (season 3)|season 3]] episode \&quot;Extinction\&quot;, the \&quot;meteor freaks\&quot; database created by Chloe Sullivan uses a program called Starr-Ware Database System 5.0, which hints at the existence of Karen Starr&#39;s corporation, Starrware, in the &#39;&#39;Smallville&#39;&#39; universe.\n** In the &#39;&#39;Smallville&#39;&#39; season 3 finale \&quot;Covenant\&quot;, a girl named Kara (played by [[Adrianne Palicki]]) claims to be from Krypton, although she does not claim to be Kal-El&#39;s relative. However, when [[Lana Lang (Smallville)|Lana Lang]] asks who she is, Clark pretends Kara is his visiting cousin. At the end of the episode, she is revealed to be &#39;&#39;&#39;Lindsay Harrison&#39;&#39;&#39;, a human empowered and possibly [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] by [[Jor-El]]&#39;s technology. As with many of the show&#39;s future superheroes, who tend to be dressed in the same colors as the costumes of their comic-book counterparts, Lindsay is dressed in white, matching the color of Power Girl&#39;s costume (minus the red cape and blue boots, as Lindsay never wore either a jacket or shoes).\n** In the &#39;&#39;Smallville&#39;&#39; [[Smallville (season 10)|season 10]] episode \&quot;Supergirl\&quot;, Lois Lane suggests \&quot;Power Girl\&quot; as a name for Kara Zor-El (then known as \&quot;Maiden of Might\&quot;).\n* Former &#39;&#39;[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]&#39;&#39; executive producer [[Andrew Kreisberg]] hinted that Power Girl could appear in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=April 9, 2016 |title=Spoiler Room: Scoop on Blindspot, Outlander, The Originals and more |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/08/spoiler-room-blindspot-outlander-originals-spoilers |access-date=April 9, 2016 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* In the &#39;&#39;[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;#Powersurge\&quot;, Supergirl (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]) is presumed dead after a major battle with [[Livewire (DC Comics)|Livewire]] and decides to reinvent herself as a new heroine and becomes Power Girl. Her comic book origins on Earth-2 are referenced when Superman begins to suspect the ruse and she makes up a story on the spot about being an alternate universe&#39;s Supergirl.\n\n===Film===\n* Power Girl appears in the animated &#39;&#39;[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]&#39;&#39; film, voiced by [[Allison Mack]]. This marks her first true appearance in animation, as opposed to the above &#39;&#39;JLU&#39;&#39; version which is merely based on her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The World&#39;s Finest |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=502 |access-date=2011-01-30 |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, she works under the command of [[Captain Atom]], who is under orders from President [[Lex Luthor]]. When Superman is framed for murdering [[Metallo]], she is the only one of her group to truly doubt his guilt, and she later switches sides and helps him and [[Batman]]. She angrily attacks [[Major Force]] after it is revealed he killed Metallo and almost killed Batman; in the fight, she accidentally ruptures Force&#39;s containment suit, almost causing him to explode, which would unleash his nuclear energies on the city. The potential disaster is averted by Captain Atom, who absorbs all of the dying Force&#39;s energy into his own containment suit, making himself considerably more powerful in the process but passing out from the strain. She is later revealed to have helped them escape from [[Hawkman]] and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. As in the graphic novel on which the film is based, she is assigned to watch over the new teenage [[Toyman]], [[Toyman#Hiro Okamura|Hiro Okamura]], who finds her quite attractive, even \&quot;testing\&quot; his X-ray goggles on her, which she finds offensive; so she breaks his goggles and avoids him from then on (he later tries to make a comment on her breast size as well, before being interrupted by Batman). She is knocked unconscious by Lex Luthor in his new [[kryptonite]] enhanced battle-suit, but she recovers and is seen at the end, along with her squad members, taking the now-impeached Luthor into custody.\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]&#39;&#39;, a evil version of Power Girl appeared on a computer page of the lesser members of the [[Crime Syndicate]].\n* Power Girl is portrayed by [[Ashley Hinshaw]] in the 2011 short film &#39;&#39;[[The Death and Return of Superman (film)|The Death and Return of Superman]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lamar |first=Cyriaque |date=February 4, 2012 |title=In this semi-drunk movie about Superman&#39;s death, Elijah Wood is Cyborg Superman |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/in-this-semi-drunk-movie-about-supermans-death-elijah-5882253 |access-date=February 4, 2019 |website=[[io9]] |publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Trumbore |first=Dave |date=February 3, 2012 |title=&#39;&#39;Chronicle&#39;&#39; Writer Max Landis Vents About The Death and Return of Superman |url=http://collider.com/chronicle-max-landis-death-and-return-of-superman/ |access-date=February 4, 2019 |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* While Power Girl doesn&#39;t appear herself, the animated &#39;&#39;[[Batman and Harley Quinn]]&#39;&#39; film briefly features a waitress, at a superhero themed restaurant called Superbabes, who is dressed in a Power Girl costume. The same restaurant is shown to offer a \&quot;Power Girl Jumbo Combo\&quot;.\n* Power Girl makes a brief appearance in &#39;&#39;[[Teen Titans Go!
