== Fictional character biography ==


=== DC Animated Universe ===
Roxy Rocket was first seen in the projects in the DC Animated Universe voiced by Charity James.
In her appearance on The New Batman Adventures, Roxanne "Roxy Rocket" Sutton was formerly a stunt double for a Hollywood actress. However, she lost her job after she tried to make her stunts too dangerous for any company to insure her. Out of work, but still hungering for thrills, Sutton began stealing jewels for Penguin, while slightly seducing him. Unlike other villains in Gotham City, Roxy's crimes were fairly benign. She was always the one being put at risk. Batman also took risks in his attempts to catch Roxy in midair chases, leading Roxy to believe Batman was a kindred spirit who understood the pleasure of risk-taking. In the end, however, Roxy realized her feelings were unrequited when Batman had her arrested as the police approach the area. When she asked what this was, Batman quoted "My game and you lost."
Roxy next appeared in "Knight Time", an episode of Superman: The Animated Series. In what amounts to a cameo appearance, Roxy tries her luck in Metropolis where she ends up tipping off Superman to the fact that Batman is conspicuously absent in Gotham. Unlike Batman (who cannot fly), Superman picks Roxy off her rocket speeder with no effort at all. The episode eventually leads to a team-up between Robin and Superman.
Roxy Rocket appears in The Batman Adventures Annual #1 where she vows to "straighten up and fly right". However she is seen robbing a safe on a security camera, but it turns out she was framed by Catwoman. Angered at this, she tries, along with Batman, to apprehend her which results in a fight between the two women. Catwoman tries to hold her hostage with the intent of killing her but Roxy manages to get away and knocks her off the rooftop with a punch. Roxy makes the effort to save her but Catwoman slashes her hand instead choosing to fall down into the alleyway below. Roxy expresses worry and extreme remorse thinking that she has killed her but Batman reassures her that Catwoman still has "eight more lives".
In Justice League Adventures #6, Hawkgirl posed as Roxy Rocket.
In Justice League Adventures #10, Roxy Rocket made a cameo where she uses a rocket pack instead of her usual rocket speeder.

"We always liked her, so we created a television story for her. Sparks fly in that one."[1]Bruce Timm called the television episode "probably the most blatantly risque episode we've ever done."


== Powers and abilities ==
Roxy has no powers, but she has an arsenal of skills that gave Batman a challenge.
She has displayed an exceptional skill in acrobatics and stunts due to her former employment as a stunt double. She has a skill in flying her trademark rocket , and has enough knowledge in mechanics to be able to repair it.
She is also very skilled in hand to hand combat, as she was able to easily defeat Jay, Lark, and Raven, the Penguin's henchwomen, who have been trained so well they were fighting on par and sometimes gaining the upper hand on Batwoman.
