She first appears in &#39;&#39;World&#39;s Finest Comics&#39;&#39; #113 (November 1960).\n\nWhen Bonnie was a child, her mother Millie put her through archery training and was very controlling of her progress. She does well and ends up competing in the Olympic Games, where she wins a bronze medal. However, her mother is not pleased as she had expected Bonnie to win a gold, and harasses her daughter over Bonnie&#39;s alleged failure. This ends up driving Bonnie to abandon both her home and archery and she never speaks to her mother again.&lt;ref name = sogiant&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Origins 80-Page Giant&#39;&#39; #1 (December 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAlone in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], she eventually becomes inspired by Green Arrow and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] and decides to use her archery skills in a way that counted. She makes a costume for herself and names herself \&quot;Miss\&quot; Arrowette. Like Green Arrow, she carries trick arrows but with a feminine slant (such as the \&quot;Powder Puff\&quot; Arrow). She attempts to aid both archers a few times, but they repeatedly rebuff her attempts. Despite her good intentions, Arrowette turns out to be too clumsy to become a hero and too vain to even wear a mask. Arrowette briefly dates the Green Arrow in his civilian identity of Oliver Queen, as shown in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League of America]]&#39;&#39; #7 (October\u2013November 1961).\n\n[[Image:Arrowette1.jpg|thumb|125px|left|The adult Bonnie King appears in &#39;&#39;Young Justice&#39;&#39;.]]\nAt some point, she meets a journalist named Bernell \&quot;Bowstring\&quot; Jones, who remembers her from her Olympic Games and is probably the only person to consider her a star. She nicknames him &#39;&#39;Bowstring&#39;&#39; because he is as thin as one and takes him briefly as her sidekick so he will give her publicity in his journal.&lt;ref name = imp28&gt;&#39;&#39;Impulse&#39;&#39; #28 (August 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, however, Green Arrow convinces Arrowette to give up superheroism.&lt;ref name = sogiant/&gt;\n\nShe has to permanently give up archery due to [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] in her wrists, and also due to her job as a secretary. She talks Bowstring into marrying her and, one year later, she has a daughter they name Cissie King-Jones.&lt;ref name=imp28/&gt; When Bowstring dies five years later from [[Ciguatera|fish poisoning]], [[Hal Jordan]] (working as an agent for the company that holds Bowstring&#39;s life insurance policy) gives Bonnie and Cissie the policy&#39;s beneficiary check; the money enables Bonnie to train Cissie into a superhero. Cissie hardly has time to breathe between lessons of archery, judo, kick-boxing, gymnastics, ballet, and many other fields, and eventually comes to resent her mother deeply.&lt;ref name = sogiant/&gt;\n\nBonnie&#39;s name is a parody or play on Green Arrow&#39;s civilian name, Oliver \&quot;Ollie\&quot; Queen.\n{{-}}\n\n===Cissie King-Jones===\nForced by her mother to adopt a version of her old costume, &#39;&#39;&#39;Suzanne \&quot;Cissie\&quot; King-Jones&#39;&#39;&#39; becomes the second &#39;&#39;&#39;Arrowette&#39;&#39;&#39;. Arrowette first appears in the pages of &#39;&#39;[[Bart Allen|Impulse]]&#39;&#39; wearing a frilly costume and a bejeweled mask that apes her mother&#39;s old costume. Despite Arrowette&#39;s success as a heroine, [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]&#39;s mentor, [[Max Mercury]], is concerned by what he sees as Bonnie&#39;s exploitation of her daughter. Child Welfare Services gets involved, and Bonnie loses custody of her daughter, who is sent to the Elias School for Girls, a [[boarding school]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|author-link =|contribution = Arrowette|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|pages = 25|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = London|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nArrowette next appears in &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice]]&#39;&#39; #4 wearing a more practical costume.&lt;ref name=yj4&gt;&#39;&#39;Young Justice&#39;&#39; #4 (January 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Acting alone, she battles the villainous [[Harm (comics)|Harm]] and is injured by him with one of her own arrows.&lt;ref name=yj4 /&gt; However, she manages to escape and contact Young Justice, later joining the team, along with the second [[Wonder Girl]] ([[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Cassie Sandsmark]]) and [[Secret (Greta Hayes)|Secret]] (Greta Hayes). The three quickly become close friends, although Cissie admits during a game of &#39;Truth or Dare&#39; that, if put in a position where she had a choice to quit being a hero, she would ask her mother&#39;s advice and then do the opposite to establish herself as an independent person.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Young Justice&#39;&#39; #5 (February 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter her school therapist\u2014one of the few adults whom Cissie trusted\u2014is brutally murdered, Cissie tracks down the killers in a violent rage. She nearly kills one of them herself, but is stopped by [[Superboy]]. Cissie is so shaken by the incident that she vows never to be Arrowette again.\n\nDespite leaving the team, Cissie remains close friends with her teammates and eventually reconciles with her mother, who convinces her daughter to try out for the \&quot;Summer Games\&quot; in [[Sydney]] (a thinly-veiled reference to the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], due to DC not being an \&quot;official partner\&quot; of the Games). With her battle-honed abilities, Cissie ends up taking home the gold, and becomes something of a celebrity, guest-starring on Superboy&#39;s favorite TV show, \&quot;&#39;&#39;Wendy the Werewolf Stalker&#39;&#39;\&quot; (a parody of &#39;&#39;[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]&#39;&#39;). She helps the [[Red Tornado]]&#39;s daughter, Traya, adjust to life at Elias and later, when Secret was returned to humanity, Cissie helps to organize placement for her at the same school.\n\n[[Image:Arrowette2.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Cissie King-Jones appears in her original Arrowette costume.]]\nNow retired from superheroics, Cissie never expresses any desire to return to her life as a superhero, despite the best efforts of several of her former teammates. They even involve her in a baseball game on an alien planet, with the fate of many innocents riding on the outcome. Cissie is enraged because they chose her instead of many other superhumans, but she participates as best as she can. Her team barely wins. Cissie still remains committed to justice and compassion. During the [[Imperiex]] war, she served as medical aid volunteer, again working with Young Justice, although the team is again divided due to uncertainty about Robin&#39;s loyalty to them after the discovery of Batman&#39;s [[JLA: Tower of Babel|files on the Justice League]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt;\n\nCissie made a brief appearance in &#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #7 when Helen Sandsmark attempts to enroll Wonder Girl into the Elias School (which seems to have expanded its student body to boys as well as girls). With Greta Hayes (formerly Secret), the girls threaten to leave the school and take Cissie&#39;s celebrity status as a gold-winning archer with her if Wonder Girl is not allowed to enroll. The school gives in to her demands.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #7 (March 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Cissie makes a second appearance in &#39;&#39;Teen Titans and Outsiders Secret Files 2005&#39;&#39;, joining Wonder Girl on a trip to [[San Francisco, California]]. Cissie wishes to give her best friend moral support as Cassie battles with the decision to tell her friends that her father was the Greek God, [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans and Outsiders Secret Files&#39;&#39; #2 (October 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; At the funeral for her former YJ teammate, [[Bart Allen]], she is mentioned in passing during a video made by Bart prior to his death. Cissie also makes a flashback cameo in &#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; #50.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #50 (October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCissie was last seen hanging out with [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Cassie]] and [[Empress (comics)|Anita]] in &#39;&#39;Wonder Girl #2&#39;&#39;, now sporting short hair. She is seen again in &#39;&#39;Wonder Girl&#39;&#39; #3 with Anita, as they help Cassie realize that she has truly gotten over Superboy&#39;s death. For the first time since &#39;retiring&#39; from super-hero work in the pages of &#39;&#39;Young Justice&#39;&#39;, Cissie wears a new Arrowette costume that resembles the second one to aid Wonder Girl rescue her mother in &#39;&#39;Wonder Girl&#39;&#39; #4.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Girl&#39;&#39; #4 (February 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Skills and abilities==\nCissie is a normal human with above average strength, stamina and agility for a girl of her age. She has exceptional hand-to-hand combatant ability, being highly skilled in [[judo]],&lt;ref name=\&quot;sogiant\&quot; /&gt; [[jeet kune do]]&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; vol 2 #153 (February 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[kickboxing]]&lt;ref name=\&quot;sogiant\&quot; /&gt; with skills as an Olympic gold-medalist longbow marksman and possesses above average intelligence.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Flashpoint===\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]&#39;&#39; universe, the Cissie King-Jones version of Arrowette joined with the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]&#39; [[Female Furies|Furies]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies&#39;&#39; #2 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The Multiversity===\nIn the series &#39;&#39;[[The Multiversity]]&#39;&#39; an alternate universe Arrowette named Cissie King-Hawke appears. She is the spoiled and popular daughter of [[Connor Hawke]]. Cissie is seen wanting to start her own superhero team called The Just however her father shows disapproval doubting she has experience to survive a life of crime fighting.&lt;ref&gt;The Multiversity: The Just 1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\nIn February 2010, actress [[Stephanie Lemelin]] announced that she had been cast as the voice of Arrowette for an animated adaptation of &#39;&#39;[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/movies/2010/02/03/young-justice-league-animated-series-in-the-works/|title=News - Entertainment, Music, Movies, Celebrity|website=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press release referred initially the character as Artemis, indicating a change in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dcanimated.com/|title=The World&#39;s Finest - The #1 DC Animation Resource|website=The World&#39;s Finest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;AG-JPH\&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| last =Weisman | first = Greg | title =Jack-Pumpkinhead writes... | work = Ask Greg | date = 2010-07-26 | url =http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=12350 | accessdate = 2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the show premiered, the newest addition to Young Justice team was &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Artemis Crock]]&#39;&#39;&#39;, a completely different character.
