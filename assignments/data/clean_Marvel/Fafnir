The character did not feature again in Marvel continuity until Thor #318 (April 1982), and was finally killed in a storyline in Thor #341-343 (March\u2013May 1984). Fafnir returned from the dead (referred to as King Fafnir of Nastrond) in Thor #486-488 (May\u2013July 1995).\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nFafnir is first encountered in the guise of an old man by the warrior Volstagg, who with his companions is currently exploring the ruined realm of Nastrond, an extradimensional realm on the continent of Asgard. Fafnir explains he was the King of Nastrond, and that the King of the Norse Gods Odin destroyed Nastrond due to the evil nature of its people. Fafnir himself was left to die in a ruined wasteland, but survives by drinking from a pool of water with magical properties. The water, however, transforms Fafnir into a massive dragon. Knowing that Volstagg and his allies were sent by Odin, Fafnir uses the power of illusion and intends to devour the Asgardians. Odin's son Thor, however, defeats Fafnir by driving the dragon into a chasm using his lightning, after which he frees Volstagg.Fafnir reappears when Thor's stepbrother and perennial foe Loki sends the dragon to Earth to kill the Thunder God. Thor, however, uses his mystical hammer Mjolnir to hold Fafnir at bay until Odin intervenes and banishes the former king back to the ruins of Nastrond. Fafnir eventually returns to Earth, destroys several abandoned buildings in New York City and battles the National Guard. Thor and Elif, the elderly chief and last survivor of a lost Viking colony armed with a spear blessed by Odin himself, arrive to battle. They are almost defeated, but Elif gives up his life to drive the spear into Fafnir, and Thor hammers it in all the way, slaying Fafnir. Thor gives Elif a noble Viking funeral by burning Fafnir's body atop his corpse.Fafnir was released from Hel alongside the Midgard Serpent, Fafnir of Jotunheim (a frost giant), Nidhogg, Farsung the Enchanter, an Ice Giant and two Ice Dwarves by Kurse to battle Thor and Lady Sif. The threat of these entities is stopped when Thor agrees to go to Hel's realm willingly.Fafnir later reappears in the 2011 limited series Avengers Prime in the aftermath of the Siege storyline as, at first, an adversary then ally of Thor, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers with several legions of ogres and elves in battle against a Twilight Sword wielding Hela and her army.\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nFafnir was originally a normal man until transformed by the properties of a magical pool into a large dragon.
