{"batchcomplete":"","query":{"pages":{"1170555":{"pageid":1170555,"ns":0,"title":"X-Corporation","extract":"The X-Corporation (X-Corp) is a fictional institution appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men comics. This organization was created to ensure the protection of mutant civil rights throughout the world due to the increasing number of mutants and widespread bigotry and hate crimes against them.\n\n\n== Fictional history ==\nX-Corp was founded by Prof. Charles Xavier, the founder of the X-Men. Its purpose is to provide support for \"civilian\" mutant populations on a global scale in a world where the mutant population was outgrowing the reach of the X-Men. X-Corp offices are located in many major cities in every continent, and each office is managed by a former member of the X-Men or one of their satellite teams, such as Sunspot or Domino. The worldwide headquarters of the X-Corporation is the X-Mansion. X-Corp works with local governments, such as when they took in the superstrong twelve-year-old orphan Molly Hayes on behalf of the Social Services of Los Angeles.\nIt should not be confused with the X-Corps, a short-lived paramilitary team led by Banshee, which merged with the X-Corporation after its dissolution, most of its members transferring to the Paris branch.\nIn the wake of the Decimation of mutantkind, wherein 90-95% of the mutant population was rendered genetically and physically human and thus powerless, several bombings occurred at X-Corporation locales. For the safety of those operating the facilities, and to regroup all empowered members, Cyclops ordered the evacuation of all X-Corp offices and the organization appears to be dead. With the minimal mutant population and the strict government rules imposed on mutants, the organization would serve no purpose.\n\n\n== Known locations ==\n\n\n== Known members ==\n\n\n=== Founder ===\nCharles Xavier\n\n\n=== Hong Kong Branch ===\nDomino (currently a mercenary for hire)\nRisque (killed in action off-panel in New X-Men Annual 2001)\n\n\n=== Los Angeles Branch ===\nEmpath (member of 198 staying on the Institute grounds)\nMagma (member of 198 staying on the Institute grounds)\nSkids (undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent)\nSkitz (possibly depowered)\nStringfellow (possibly depowered)\nSunspot (former COO of Los Angeles Branch; former Lord Imperial of the Hellfire Club)\n\n\n=== Mumbai Branch ===\nFeral (killed in action by Sabretooth came back as a ghost)\nSunfire\nThornn (depowered currently repowered)\nWarpath (currently member of X-Men)\n\n\n=== Paris Branch ===\nCannonball (currently a member of X-Men)\nDarkstar (killed in action, later revived in Winter Guard mini-series)\nHolly (secretary, possibly depowered)\nM (currently a member of X-Factor)\nMultiple Man (currently a member of X-Factor)\nRictor (currently a member of X-Factor)\nSabra (currently a freelance operative working for the U.S. government)\nSiryn (currently a member of X-Factor)\n\n\n=== Singapore Branch ===\nLifeguard\nThunderbird (Neal Shaara)\n\n\n== Alternate uses ==\nIn the Marvel Trading Card Game, X-Corp is the evil scientific corporation that is controlled by the Hobgoblin, from the Spider-Man series.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUncannyxmen.net feature on X-Corporation"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
