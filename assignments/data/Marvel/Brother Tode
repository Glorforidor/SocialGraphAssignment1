They appeared in the Eternals' series Volume 1 and 2. Recently, they appeared in ''Thor: The Deviants Saga''#1-5 (2012) written by Robert Kodi and illustred by Steven Segovia.\n\n==Fictional history==\nThey are an offshoot of the evolutionary process that created sentient life on Earth instigated by the alien [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], and wage war against their counterparts, the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]. According to the account of one Deviant in the 2006 comic book mini-series,<ref>''Eternals'' #5 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> the Deviants were created as a delicacy to be consumed ''en masse'' by Celestials at periodic intervals once they multiplied sufficiently. The veracity of this has yet to be proven.\n\nWhile the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] possess godlike power and are generally physically beautiful (by human standards), the Deviants (who sometimes refer to themselves as 'the changing people') are for the most part hideous (again, by human standards), with each member of their race possessing some random physical and/or cosmetic [[mutation]] that is by Celestial design never repeated within the sub-species. Extremely mutated or deformed Deviants are referred to as \"mutates\" and some of the monsters of myth and legend have in fact been identified as Deviant mutates. Some of these mutations can provide [[superhuman]] abilities, but their powers are usually not as great as those of the Eternals.\n\nThe Deviants are religious, revering the [[Dreaming Celestial]] (\"He Who Sleeps in Darkness\"). They credit him with their creation and claim that he granted them dominion over the Earth, an agreement they believe was later broken by the treachery of the other Celestials. They have one or more holy books\u2014the only one named thus far being the ''Book of Krask''.\n\nThe Deviants had already developed advanced technology such as [[genetic engineering]] when humans were still living in caves.\n\nAt some point in prehistoric times, some Deviants chased after [[Star Brand#Vnn|Vnn]] and his lover Brrkk. When Brrkk died, Vnn found the corpse of a [[Tyrannosaurus]] that previously possessed the [[Star Brand]]. Vnn absorbed the Star Brand powers and used them to defeat the Deviants.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 8 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the advent of the heroic age, Brother Tode was leading the Deviants, with his capital in the city of the Toad in the sunken continent of Lemuria.<ref>'''Eternals' Vol. 1 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the Fourth  Celestial Host arrived to Earth, deviant's soldiers led by Warlord Kro attacked New York City in an attempt to provoke fear in the humans and trick them into attacking the Celestials .<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>  When this attempt failed, the Deviants sent an attack team to the Celestial spaceship, which failed too.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, the Deviant's aristocracy, led by  Brother Tode , attacked Olympia, kidnapped the Eternals with the intent to disintegrate them. However, the hero Iron Man ( James Rhodes) rescued the eternals and helped them in the defeat of the deviants. The eternals transformed the deviant's aristocracy into a synthetic cube, killing them. <ref>''Iron Man Annual'' Vol. 1 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Only Warlord Kro escaped with the help of his old lover Thena of the eternals.\n\nWithout the aristocracy, the deviant's priests seized power, led by Priestlord [[Ghaur]], who killed the son of Tode, Ranar. Kro returned to Lemuria and was crowned as a figurehead monarch, with the real power in the hands of Ghaur. <ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> With their new leader, the Deviants battled the Eternals again. Ghaur absorbed the power of the Dreaming Celestial and tried to ascend to godhood, but was defeated by the Eternals and the [[Avengers (comics)]] and was disintegrated. Kro was left as king of the deviants. <ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #10-12. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\nGhaur returned to corporeal form and tried to obtain the Serpent Crown with help of the Atlantean Lemurians, led by [[Llyra]], in an attempt to invoke the Old God Set.<ref>''Amazing Spider Man Annual'' Vol. 1 #23.(1989) Marvel Comics.</ref> The Avengers and Fantastic Four put an end to their mad plan and Ghaur was disintegrated again. <ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' Vol. 1 #22. (1989) Marvel Comics.</ref>Without Ghaur, and with the abdication of Kro, the deviant society fall into anarchy and revolution. Brother Visara led them in killing all the ''leaders'' and their followers. He was ultimately killed as well.<ref>''Eternals Herod Factor'' #1 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, Kro led a group of  heroic Deviants , the Delta Network to rescue the Avengers  from a resurrected Ghaur, who used his powers to control the deviants once more.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1 #370-371. (1995) Marvel Comics.</ref> Ghaur and the Deviants fought the Eternals and the [[Heroes for Hire]].<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' Vol. 2 #5-7. (1997) Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\nMuch later, the Deviants males were rendered sterile and a power contest between [[Ereshkigal (comics)]] and Ghaur happened. Ghaur won when he promised the deviants the return of the fertility with the help of the kidnapped eternal [[Phastos]]. The Asgardian god Thor rescued Phastos and battled Ghaur. When the Unbiding stone was destroyed, Ghaur and Erishkigal disappeared and Kro was left leading the Deviants.<ref>''Thor: the Deviants Saga'' Vol. 1 #1-5 (2012).
