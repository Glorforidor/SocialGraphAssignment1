In Morrison&#39;s version, the child Damian Wayne is the result of a tryst between Batman and Talia, during which the Dark Knight claims he was drugged when they were at the [[Tropic of Cancer]], though Morrison later admitted the claim of drugging was a canonical error on his part. Since then however in issues of the Morrison penned &#39;&#39;Batman Incorporated&#39;&#39;, the drugging is reaffirmed and is once again part of Damian&#39;s origin.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman Incorporated&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #2 (June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nThe final issue of &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39; (2008) designates the &#39;&#39;Kingdom Come&#39;&#39; alternate universe as Earth-22, thus making the Ibn al Xu&#39;ffasch version part of the [[DC Multiverse]] and Damian Wayne&#39;s parallel universe counterpart. &#39;&#39;Justice Society of America&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #22 (2009) reveals that he would eventually marry [[Nightstar (comics)|Nightstar (Mar&#39;i Grayson)]] with whom he would have a daughter and son.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===&#39;&#39;Batman and Son&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|Batman and Son}}\n[[File:Proto-Robin (Damian Wayne).png|right|thumb|upright|Damian Wayne in &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #658 (December 2006). Art by [[Andy Kubert]].]]\nDamian&#39;s origin is unknown to Batman. Genetically perfected and grown in an artificial womb, Damian was intended to be a formidable warrior. He is raised by his mother [[Talia al Ghul]] and the [[League of Assassins]]. He becomes a talented martial artist before his teenage years, at which time Talia reveals Damian&#39;s existence to Bruce Wayne and leaves him in Batman&#39;s custody in an effort to disrupt Batman&#39;s work.\n\nPrecocious, spoiled, and violent, Damian battles [[Tim Drake]], whom he wants to replace as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and sucker punches Tim off the stuffed [[Tyrannosaurus]] in the [[Batcave]] when Tim stops fighting to help him. Damian then escapes, dons a variant Robin costume made of [[Jason Todd]]&#39;s old tunic and mask and assorted League of Assassin gear, and gets into a fight with and decapitates the villainous Spook. Although misguided, Damian seems to genuinely want to aid Bruce&#39;s war on crime as he is Bruce&#39;s son and wants his approval. Unfortunately, because of how he was raised, Damian lacks any sort of common sense in regards to social behavior, and believes that in order to be accepted by his father, he must kill any rivals, which included Tim Drake. This troubles his relationship with Batman, who vows never to kill. However, because of his possible paternity to Damian, Batman, on some levels, is optimistic by the chance of fatherhood. \n\nEventually, Batman confronts Talia to confirm Damian&#39;s true identity, but both Talia and Damian are soon caught in an explosion. They survive the explosion. However, Damian&#39;s badly injured body requires transplants of harvested organs, which his mother orders her physicians to carry out. Damian makes a full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #665&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;The Resurrection of Ra&#39;s al Ghul&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|Batman: The Resurrection of Ra&#39;s al Ghul}}\nBeginning in &#39;&#39;Batman Annual #26 (\&quot;Head of the Demon\&quot;)&#39;&#39;, Talia takes Damian to the Australian [[Outback]], where he is tutored in the secret history of his grandfather Ra&#39;s al Ghul. Talia is unaware that a former servant of Ra&#39;s, named White Ghost, plans to use Damian as a shell for the soul of Ra&#39;s to return to Earth. This process would, of course, kill Damian. Talia is able to save her son from his fate at the last minute.\n\nRa&#39;s is still able to return, but as a rotting, shambling undead corpse, still needing Damian to stabilize his form. Damian flees to alert Batman, but is pursued by his evil grandfather. Upon entering [[Wayne Manor]], Damian attempts to relay to ([[Tim Drake]]) the fact that Ra&#39;s has returned. Tim, suspicious of Damian&#39;s intentions, does not believe his story and begins a fist fight. Damian flees and encounters Alfred. Before he can effectively relay his news, he is attacked by Tim, who perceives Damian&#39;s attempt to help a tripping Alfred as an attack, and renews their battle. As they fight, members of the League of Assassins approach the manor with the intention of killing all others within and bringing Damian back to Ra&#39;s alive. Damian and Tim fight side by side against Ra&#39;s and his minions. Their collaboration is hindered by their very different philosophies of battle. Damian is willing to betray Tim at any moment for his own safety. Ra&#39;s captures the two and tells Batman that he will use one of them for his own body. Batman offers his own body instead.\n\nRa&#39;s refuses the offer, feeling that he needs someone of a younger age. The choices are Tim or Damian. Batman offers a third alternative: \&quot;Fountain of Essence\&quot; which contains the qualities of a [[Lazarus Pit]]. Batman and Ra&#39;s go in search of the fountain, leaving Tim, Damian, [[Nightwing]], [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and Talia to battle the [[Sensei (DC Comics)|Sensei]]. Damian leaves his mother and Tim to an unknown fate, while he goes off to be with his father. He ends up captured by Ra&#39;s and nearly loses his life. Batman and the others manage to save him, and Talia takes her son and escapes.\n\nA subsequent conversation between Tim and Alfred implies that Batman has carried out a DNA test on Damian. Alfred says Bruce intended to tell him the results when the time was right. At this, Tim realizes that Damian is indeed Bruce&#39;s son, and exclaims \&quot;The son of Satan is my brother?\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Did he do a paternity test on Damian? You know, like a DNA test... He had to, right? Alfred? -Tim Drake \&quot;He insisted he would tell you the results himself when the time was right.\&quot; -Alfred \&quot;So you know. You both know and nobody is going to tell me?\&quot; -Tim Drake \&quot;It&#39;s not my place to say, young sir. Forgive me.\&quot; -Alfred \&quot;The son of Satan is my brother?\&quot; -Tim Drake. Dialogue post-midway through comic book (\&quot;son of Satan\&quot; likely in reference to &#39;&#39;The Omen&#39;&#39; franchise). \&quot;Morrison, Grant. &#39;&#39;Batman #676&#39;&#39;. DC Comics, Inc., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;Batman R.I.P.&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|Batman R.I.P.}}\nPrior to the start of Grant Morrison&#39;s \&quot;[[Batman R.I.P.]]\&quot; story arc in &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #675, Damian senses that someone is out to get Batman. In response to this, Talia begins formulating a plan involving Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], whom Talia and Damian rescue from a booby-trapped Wayne Manor while in search of Batman, who is insane and has gone missing.\n\nDamian and Alfred race to aid Batman against the Black Glove in a commandeered [[Batmobile]]. Damian, who is driving, knocks an ambulance off a bridge without any sign of remorse or even concern. When Alfred reprimands him, Damian retorts with a backhanded threat. The only occupant of the ambulance was the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].\n\n===&#39;&#39;Battle for the Cowl&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|Batman: Battle for the Cowl}}\nIn &#39;&#39;Nightwing&#39;&#39; #153 (2009), Damian is shown being left in the care of [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and trained by [[Dick Grayson]] (alias Nightwing).\n\nUpon the start of &#39;&#39;Batman: Battle for the Cowl&#39;&#39;, it appears that Damian is now residing in Gotham, and living under the command of Nightwing (to an extent). Where before Damian portrayed an arrogant and vicious personality, it appears the \&quot;death\&quot; of his father has regressed him to a more childlike mindset, as demonstrated when he takes the Batmobile joy-riding with an older girl. This is discovered by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], who ejects the girl and takes control of the Batmobile, intent on taking Damian home. The car is blindsided by [[Killer Croc]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who prepare to kill Damian. The older girl (Damian&#39;s companion) is later eaten by Killer Croc.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: Battle for the Cowl&#39;&#39; #1 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Damian is saved by Nightwing who ends up being cornered by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]&#39;s men, until a murderous figure appears stating that he is Batman (later revealed to be Jason Todd). Although shot by Todd, Damian recovers and saves Tim Drake from falling to death inside Jason&#39;s Batcave.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: Battle for the Cowl&#39;&#39; #2 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; When Grayson hangs up his Nightwing mantle to become the newest Batman, he chooses Damian to assume the mantle of Robin by his side.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: Battle for the Cowl&#39;&#39; #3 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;Batman: Reborn&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|Batman: Reborn}}\nDespite becoming Robin to Grayson&#39;s Batman, Damian reveals that he cares little for his older brother and has no respect for him as Batman and that the latter would have to earn it. In an act of defiance, Damian decides to make the Robin mantle independent from that of Batman and decides to stop [[Doctor Phosphorus|Dr. Phosphorus]] from breaking into [[Project Cadmus]], but fails miserably and is saved by Dick. Dick then begins to train Damian as to how to properly become the new Robin and the two develop their own unique crime fighting style. Damian then begins to mock Tim Drake for not being chosen as Robin, causing Tim to severely beat Damian, only to be stopped by Dick.\n\nAfter Tim leaves, Damian starts engaging in chess games with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], visiting him secretly against Dick&#39;s orders. When Elliot asked why Damian is visiting him behind the Bat-family&#39;s back, Damian shrugs it off as a desire to keep Elliot company. Elliot surmises that Damian is rather using the resemblance to Bruce to \&quot;spend time with [his] old man\&quot;. Dick and Damian then encounter a villain called [[Professor Pyg]], who has created an army called Dollotrons. Dick and Damian take the entire army down and begin to form a brotherly relationship. Damian blames himself for being unable to save a single Dollotron, a girl named Sasha, but unbeknownst to him, the girl is taken in by Jason Todd, who had shot Damian,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman &amp; Robin&#39;&#39; vol.3 #3 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; thereby becoming the new Robin&#39;s opposite number in Red Hood&#39;s no-holds-barred war against crime (Red Hood&#39;s maxim is \&quot;let the punishment fit the crime\&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman &amp; Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #4 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDamian and Dick then attack Firefly, who is attempting to kill Black Mask. Victor Zsasz defeats Robin and rescues Black Mask while Dick takes down Firefly. These events cause Hush to escape, causing Damian to grow a further hatred for the criminal. Damian is present when Dick is inducted into the JLA, upon hearing, Damian demands to be inducted along with Dick, but his demands are promptly ignored. Damian is once again saved by Dick, with the assistance of Azrael, after a man named Amon tries to sacrifice him. Sasha, now dubbed Scarlet by Todd, returns and attacks Robin, as Jason attacks Dick, the two duos battle it out until the arrival of the Flamingo, who temporarily paralyzes Damian. Talia fixes Damian&#39;s spine, but puts in a monitor connected to his brain allowing her to control his every movement.\n\nAs Dick and Damian go through various events together, such as against the Black Mask, the Blackest Night and a rogue Batman clone-corpse, the two bond even more, prompting Talia to give over control of the monitor to [[Deathstroke]] who tries to use it to kill Dick. Working together, Dick and Damian manage to stop Deathstroke. As Dick cares little for the financial problems of Wayne Enterprises, despite inheriting it from Bruce along with Tim, Damian decides to involve himself and manages to impress the board of directors. While he does not file a lawsuit against Dick, due to Grayson not being named the heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]], but rather a high-ranking member, he does against Tim, who was named the heir to Wayne Enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman &amp; Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #10 (March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;Red Robin&#39;&#39;===\nDamian&#39;s second year as Robin begins with a bang, as he chooses this time to pick a fight against his predecessor [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]]. Tim, who has been keeping a hit list of criminals and tasks, attracts Damian&#39;s fury when the latter hacks the hit list and discovers a hidden layer of allies to the bat family considered potential threats by Tim, including Damian. During a stakeout mission, Damian slices off Tim&#39;s line, causing him to fall from a great height. He survives, and Tim pulls Damian into an all-out brawl that begins with their quarry escaping, and ending in front of the theater where Bruce Wayne&#39;s parents were killed. The two are stopped by [[Dick Grayson|Batman]], who chastises them both for fighting in front of the theater where Batman was born. The two then enter into a grudging truce for the remainder of Damian&#39;s appearances in the series. Dick suggests changing the hit list password to [[Cousin Oliver#Notable Recurring characters|cousin Oliver]], as Damian has little to no interest in pop culture references and would never guess it. Dick noted that his name is not on the list and Tim asserts it&#39;s because Dick is the only one who Tim trusts implicitly.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Blackest Night&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\nAfter Bruce&#39;s skull was taken from his grave, Damian and Dick decide to bring the rest of his skeleton, along with those of Damian&#39;s paternal grandparents, to their base beneath Wayne Tower. Damian is quite shaken by the sight of the bones of his family. On the way to the cave, Dick&#39;s body is possessed by [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]], at whom Damian lashes out in confusion. Deadman then possesses and leaves Damian&#39;s body, subsequently passing his knowledge of the attack of the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] onto him. The two heroes then prepare for the Black Lanterns&#39; assault on Gotham.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blackest Night: Batman&#39;&#39; #1 (August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; After raiding the Army Reserve National Guard Armory, Dick, Damian, and the arriving Tim Drake, are able to save Commissioner Gordon, Oracle, and the surviving police officers at Gotham Central from the reanimated versions of the original Dark Knight&#39;s deceased rogues gallery members. However, they then find themselves in a horrific encounter with the parents of Dick Grayson and Tim Drake reanimated as Black Lanterns.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blackest Night: Batman&#39;&#39; #2 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Dick and Tim send Damian with the Gordons to their underground base while they battle the Black Lanterns. Dick eventually orders Damian through their comm-links to send one of his Wingers with [[Mr. Freeze]]&#39;s gun. Grayson uses the weapon to cryogenically suspend himself and Tim, forcing the Black Lanterns to retreat as they are unable to read any sign of life of them. Deadman later revives the former Boy Wonders.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Blackest Night: Batman&#39;&#39; #3 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Return of Bruce Wayne===\nTalia begins to clone Damian as she realizes that her son has completely sided with Dick Grayson and the Bat-Family. Damian finally stands up for his Robin mantle, telling Talia that being Robin was the best thing that he had ever done, and Talia does not need to save him from something he chooses to be. Talia then shows Damian a cloned version of himself, whom she sees as Damian&#39;s younger brother. Talia admits to Damian, that even though she loves him, she is too much of a perfectionist to admire him for choosing a path that defies her this blatantly, and he is therefore no longer welcome, and will be considered an enemy of the House of al Ghul. Damian defiantly replies that he hopes to be a worthy one. Damian (as Robin) is then seen teaming up with Dick and Alfred to begin their own search for Bruce Wayne.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman &amp; Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #12 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring a confrontation with a returned minor villain the Getaway Genius, Damian is initially angry that Grayson failed to capture the foe \u2013 as well as the implication that his father failed as well during the Genius&#39; original run back when Grayson was Robin \u2013 but when Dick explains to him that Bruce let the Genius go because he discovered that the Genius&#39; robberies were only him stealing medicines that he needed so that he could live long enough to see his daughter grow up, Damian realises that he never really knew his father as a person, and admits that there was more to him than Batman.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #703&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter Grayson&#39;s confidant Oberon Sexton is revealed to be the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in disguise, Damian tortures the villain by savagely beating him with a crowbar in order to get information, considering it to be self-defense since the Joker planned to attack him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman &amp; Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #13 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Clown Prince of Crime&#39;s apparent helplessness is revealed to be another ruse and he incapacitates Damian with his hidden Joker venom. The villain intends to use Damian and Dick in his fight against their common enemies: the Black Glove. Help arrives in the form of the original Batman. After Bruce Wayne helps Dick and Damian defeat the Black Glove and the Joker, Wayne accepts his son in addition to his role as Robin.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman &amp; Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #16 (November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Bruce&#39;s parental responsibilities to Damian, he decides that he prefers Damian to continue working with Dick (who maintains the Batman mantle and whom Bruce sees as a positive role model for his son) rather than being with himself primarily, due to his plans with &#39;&#39;[[Batman Incorporated|Batman Inc.]]&#39;&#39;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: The Return&#39;&#39; one-shot (Jan. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Teen Titans===\nDamian joins the Teen Titans when Dick Grayson concludes that the team needs a Robin, while also feeling that Damian would benefit from the friendship of other heroes, having progressed to the point where he can be trusted not to kill if left &#39;unsupervised&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #88&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wonder Girl objects to this decision, Grayson convinces her to let Damian stay on the team as he needs Damian to learn that he can trust others not to betray him, only for his temper to jeopardize his first mission with the team when he attacks an opponent just after [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] had convinced him to calm down, provoking their new foe into starting his wave of destruction again.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #89&lt;/ref&gt; Robin eventually begins to develop a friendship with [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]], who initially reaches out to Damian due to their similar upbringings (Ravager&#39;s father being the notorious assassin, [[Deathstroke]]).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #91&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Drake eventually comes to the Titans for help after a robotic duplicate of [[Calculator (comics)|the Calculator]] attempts to murder his close friend, [[Tamara Fox|Tam Fox]], and decides to rejoin the team once the mission is completed. Damian chooses to leave the team upon Drake&#39;s return, reasoning that the Teen Titans do not need two Robins, and realizing that his teammates prefer to work with Tim. Upon returning to Gotham, Damian tells Dick that even though he had been brought to the Titans in order to find friends, he did not need to, as he already had one, Grayson himself.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #92&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen [[Cassandra Cain|Blackbat]], [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]]&#39;s predecessor, returns to Gotham, she and Damian are partnered together during a stake-out to catch the Architect, a new villain obsessed with destroying Gotham landmarks. Damian berates Blackbat and mocks her for being sent to Hong Kong by his father, but she ultimately saves his life by rescuing him from the exploding [[Iceberg Lounge]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: Gates of Gotham&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the two work together to stop the bomber from destroying a massive bridge, saving dozens of lives in the process.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: Gates of Gotham&#39;&#39; #2&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRobin and a group of other ex-Titans later head to [[Titans Tower]] to help the team during a battle against [[Superboy-Prime]] and the [[Legion of Doom]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #99&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, Robin destroys one of Prime&#39;s evil [[Match (DC Comics)|Superboy doppelg\u00e4ngers]] by using a [[Kryptonite]] blade.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #100&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The New 52===\n[[File:Damian-Wayne-BRv25.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Damian Wayne in &#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 2, #5 (March 2012). Art by Patrick Gleason.]]\nFollowing the \&quot;[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\&quot; story arc, Bruce Wayne was returned by writers as being the only [[Batman]] in 2011&#39;s [[the New 52]] relaunch of DC Comics. [[Dick Grayson]] was returned to his previous role as [[Nightwing]], and Damian still serves as his father&#39;s vigilante partner [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. After reading the letter written by his father from an alternate timeline, the Dark Knight decides that it is time to take steps to put his past behind him. He tries to teach Damian the same values his parents have instilled within him as he finally assumes his role as a father.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #1 (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite Bruce&#39;s attempts to build a relationship with his son, Damian remains distant from his father, which Alfred worries about. Although this relationship is further strained when Damian seemingly leaves Wayne Manor to join the villain [[Morgan Ducard|Nobody]], it turns out this was a ruse by Damian to bring down Nobody. Although Damian eventually kills Nobody in front of Bruce, they are able to work through the incident by beginning to actively understand and respect one another as father and son. Bruce goes so far as to conceal the event from Dick and Tim, leading Alfred to comment to Bruce that he has become \&quot;quite the overprotective parent\&quot;.\n\nIn Batman-related issues of the New 52 taking place after Batman issue #14 ([[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]&#39;s return to comics), Damian was portrayed as being very interested in fighting his father&#39;s arch foe. He seemed to always be eager to take on the Joker, and repeatedly assumes that bad things happening in Gotham are related to the Joker in some way, in hopeful anticipation of an encounter with him. In &#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 2, #15, Damian defies his father&#39;s orders to remain in the [[Batcave]] and investigates Alfred&#39;s kidnapping. The investigation leads to Gotham Zoo where Damian is captured by Joker. Joker accuses Damian and the other members of Batman&#39;s family of being a burden that prevents Batman from being the best foe for Joker. Joker tells Damian that his and Batman&#39;s greatest fear is being responsible for the other&#39;s death. Joker then presents Damian with Batman in Joker makeup, and states that Damian must kill Batman before Batman kills him.{{sfn|Tomasi|February 2013}} Unwilling to kill his father, Damian chooses death, but the Joker kills Batman before he can deal a fatal blow. Damian passes out from [[Joker venom]] and Batman is revealed to be a fake; as Damian recovers from the toxin, the Joker presents him with a cloche. The Joker is eventually defeated by Batman, but the trust between Batman and the [[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman Family]] is shattered.\n\nDuring the \&quot;Leviathan\&quot; story arc, when his mother Talia puts a price on his head and is targeted by the most dangerous and skilled assassins, Bruce faked Damian&#39;s death and secluded him in the Batcave in order to protect him while he goes undercover to confront Talia and her minions. But against his father&#39;s wishes he escapes, donning a new costume under the name of Redbird.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: Incorporated&#39;&#39; #3 (September 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAlong with the mysterious Wingman and most of the Bat-family, Damian manages to rescue his father and defeat most of the League of Shadows. However, Batman explains that the temporary defeat of the League will not stop a larger force to attack later and destroy the city, so he came to the extreme decision that the only solution possible is for Damian to return to his mother, a decision that caused an emotional reaction on Damian like never before.\n\n====Death====\nDamian is killed battling a brutal enemy, the Heretic (an adult Damian clone) in issue number 8 of the second volume of the &#39;&#39;[[Batman, Inc.]]&#39;&#39; comic book, which went on sale February 27, 2013. According to the story&#39;s writer, [[Grant Morrison]]: \&quot;He saves the world. He does his job as Robin. He dies an absolute hero\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DC killing off Batman&#39;s &#39;Boy Wonder&#39; Damian Wayne in new comic book|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/holy_hit_job_robin_eats_it_kZ9EWvYlw10mf4wS324GhN|work=New York Post|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Batman&#39;s side-kick Robin to be killed off in next DC Comics issue|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57571321/batmans-side-kick-robin-to-be-killed-off-in-next-dc-comics-issue/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the comic, Damian is fighting hordes of [[Leviathan (DC Comics)|Leviathan]] henchmen in the lobby of Wayne Tower when Nightwing comes to rescue him. Behind cover, the two briefly reminisce about their time together as Batman and Robin before resuming the defense. When the Heretic arrives and knocks Nightwing out, Damian bravely fights him. However, the Heretic eventually gains the upper hand and impales Damian through the chest, the sword piercing Damian&#39;s heart and resulting in Damian dying almost instantly. Minutes after Damian&#39;s death, Batman arrives and sees Damian&#39;s dead body. Angered, he and a revived Nightwing battle the Heretic, but are eventually forced to retreat with Red Robin, and Damian&#39;s body. After holding a private funeral for the fallen Boy Wonder, Bruce vows to avenge his son&#39;s death.\n\nThe later storyline, &#39;&#39;Requiem&#39;&#39;, deals with the aftermath of Damian&#39;s death and Batman&#39;s thirst for revenge against Talia as well as his own increasingly unbalanced mental state resulting from this loss. He is buried next to Bruce Wayne&#39;s parents, Damian&#39;s paternal grandparents. Batman is also unwilling to accept his son&#39;s death, and begins seeking the means to resurrect Damian at the cost of his relationships with his friends and allies, and keeps his death a secret from public in anticipation that his resurrection would succeed.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #19 (April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #20 (May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Damian&#39;s absence has also been causing a conflict between his father and his acting instructor, [[Carrie Kelley]], who is determined to find out what has happened to him, leading her to realize that the Waynes are harboring a secret.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #19 (April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen Batman and Nightwing finally re-confront Heretic, they overpower him, and the clone suffers a brutal beating from both in retaliation for Damian&#39;s death. Batman, despite desiring to kill his son&#39;s murderer more than anything and Nightwing making no attempts of stopping his mentor, spares the villain&#39;s life after seeing his resemblance to Damian, realizing the clone is what is left of his son. However, Talia later kills the Heretic for his failure to kill Batman, and challenges Batman to a duel to the death in the Batcave.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman, Incorporated&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #12 (July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; But Talia is killed following the duel by [[Batwoman (Kathy Kane)|Kathy Webb]], and it is later revealed that Damian&#39;s body was stolen from the Manor cemetery by the League of Assassins along with Talia&#39;s for plans against Batman in addition to make their resurrections. It has also been shown that Ra&#39;s al Ghul has begun to engineer more clones of Damian.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman, Incorporated&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #13 (August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Road to Resurrection====\nAfter being preoccupied with a series of cases in Gotham, Batman begins his attempt to reclaim Damian&#39;s body despite Ra&#39;s claim that he wishes to resurrect his daughter and grandson. Batman continues his pursuit out of his distrust towards Ra&#39;s. After defeating Damian&#39;s half-aquatic clones with [[Aquaman]], Batman seeks [[Wonder Woman]]&#39;s help in chasing Ra&#39;s to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Aquaman&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #29 (March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Though Ra&#39;s attempts to resurrect Damian alongside Talia in what he thought was a Lazarus Pit in the island in addition to brainwash his grandson into joining him afterwards, instead Ra&#39;s discovers that it is a portal to a Netherworld in the Pit&#39;s former location, of which both Wonder Woman and Batman were already aware. Ra&#39;s flees with the bodies afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #30 (April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter Batman and [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] locate Ra&#39;s and the bodies, they are too late as Ra&#39;s has successfully had them placed in a Lazarus Pit, leaving Batman in dread of Damian&#39;s fate.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Frankenstein&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #31 (May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The resurrections fail, leaving Ra&#39;s to realize his arrogance for allowing the Heretic to kill his grandson, and regret allowing Talia to clone Damian. After defeating Ra&#39;s in combat, Batman reclaims Damian&#39;s body and threatens his son&#39;s maternal grandfather that if he steals his son&#39;s body again, he will kill him in retaliation. They later encounter [[Darkseid]]&#39;s elite member [[Glorious Godfrey]], setting in motion the &#39;&#39;Robin Rises&#39;&#39; story arc.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Ra&#39;s al Ghul&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #32 (June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Return====\nLater, Godfrey&#39;s reason for coming to Earth is revealed; to retrieve the Chaos Shard, a powerful crystal that once belonged to Darkseid which Ra&#39;s revealed was hidden inside the sarcophagus he crafted for Damian. After detecting a trace signature of the shard coming from inside Damian&#39;s body, Godfrey escapes with Damian&#39;s corpse back to Apokolips, despite assistance from the Justice League. Angered, Batman once again vows to retrieve his son&#39;s corpse.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Robin Rises: Omega&#39;&#39; one-shot (July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nBatman enters and accesses the Justice League Watchtower to use his unstable exosuit known as the Hellbat armor designed by Batman himself and the Justice League members to engage large scale threats.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #33 (July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; He then activates the Boom Tube to Darkseid&#39;s homeworld, Apokolips, to retrieve Damian&#39;s corpse.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #34 (August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Batman successfully retrieves his son&#39;s corpse as he and his family team return to Earth via the Boom Tube directly to the Batcave after successfully escaping the clutches of Darkseid and his Parademons. After this, Batman uses the Chaos Shard on his son&#39;s corpse, which has been infused with Darkseid&#39;s Omega Sanction. With Batman facing two choices of whether to resurrect Damian or his parents, he chooses his son, granting Damian&#39;s true resurrection. As Damian and Batman embrace, Batman collapses from exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #37 (December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHowever, before the team can celebrate, the Boom Tube used to return to Earth was not closed and Darkseid&#39;s son Kalibak arrives and attacks the team. During the fight, Kalibak beats the team nearly to death, when suddenly Damian knocks out Kalibak with a powerful uppercut; discovering that due to the Chaos Shard he has gained superhuman abilities. While Damian fights Kalibak, Batman remotely controls the Batwing and sends it crashing into Kalibak, sending him back through the Boom Tube and then closes the portal. Damian then reunites with his father and his family team. In the aftermath, Damian is tested by Batman on how to control his new power abilities before Damian returns to the role as Robin.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Robin Rises: Alpha&#39;&#39; one-shot (December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; With help from the Justice League, Batman discovers that Damian&#39;s new powers do not last, and he eventually relies on his natural abilities once more.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #40 (March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Damian Wayne Rebirth.png|thumb|right|upright|Damian Wayne in [[DC Rebirth]]; art by Jim Lee, Scott Williams, and Lex Sinclair]]\n\n====&#39;&#39;Robin: Son of Batman&#39;&#39;====\nAfter the events of &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Endgame]]&#39;&#39; that resulted in Bruce Wayne&#39;s disappearance, Damian, as Robin, sets out on a globe-spanning journey to forge his own destiny and make amends for all of his wrongdoings in his own series, titled &#39;&#39;Robin: Son of Batman&#39;&#39;. Along his journey, he crosses paths with Ra&#39;s and Talia al Ghul, Deathstroke, and a new character named Maya Ducard, daughter of the late villain, NoBody. Damian plays a particular role in &#39;&#39;[[Batman and Robin Eternal]]&#39;&#39; when the Bat-Family is pitted against Mother, a ruthless woman who believes that she can make her &#39;children&#39; stronger by putting them through intense trauma. Returning to assist his fellow Robins as the crisis reaches its conclusion, Damian helps Dick, Jason and Tim regain confidence in themselves after Mother decimates their initial efforts against her by recalling a conversation he had with Bruce where Bruce noted that he is proud of how all three of the other Robins have different strengths, Bruce wanting his partners to find their own paths rather than blindly follow his own example.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman &amp; Robin Eternal&#39;&#39; #22&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDamian is also a major player in the &#39;&#39;[[Robin War]]&#39;&#39; event, where he, Agent 37 (Dick Grayson), Red Hood, and Red Robin organize a street gang called \&quot;Robins\&quot; to defeat the Court of Owls with reluctant aid from Jim Gordon, who is now Batman. In the climax, the Court manipulates Damian into joining them so they can use him to recruit Agent 37. Dick does join in order to save Damian and end the war. In the aftermath, Robin forms an unlikely partnership with his mother Talia.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{Update|date=August 2017}}\nAs part of the [[DC Rebirth]], Damian is featured in three titles: &#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39;, where he becomes the team&#39;s leader in order to defeat Ra&#39;s al Ghul and succeed Red Robin (Tim Drake) as leader, &#39;&#39;Super Sons&#39;&#39;, co-starring with [[Jonathan Samuel Kent|Jon Kent]], the son of [[Superman]] and the new Superboy and &#39;&#39;Nightwing&#39;&#39;, where he will have a supporting role.\n===Teen Titans Rebirth===\nOn his 13th birthday Damian is sent a package by his grandfather Ra&#39;s al Ghul, which contains a dead robin. After a meeting with his mother Talia, he discovers that it is a warning from his cousin Mara al Ghul, who has chosen him as her prey as part of an initiation ritual that she must undertake in order to properly join the League of Assassins. Mara has been made leader of a group known as the Demon&#39;s Fist, which was originally supposed to be led by Damian, but became hers when he chose to leave the League. They, too, have chosen targets that they must hunt down in order to ascend to the League. Damian decides to collect the other Demon&#39;s Fist&#39;s targets in order to form the new Teen Titans; this includes [[Starfire (Koriand&#39;r)|Starfire]], [[Beast Boy]], [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Wally West II|Kid Flash]].\n\nAfter the events of &#39;&#39;Justice League: No Justice&#39;&#39;, the Titans disband. In his subsequent struggle with organized crime in Gotham and a mysterious crime lord known as The Other, Damian assembles a new team of Titans, consisting of Kid Flash (the only old team member to join), Kid Flash&#39;s friend and kid genius Roundhouse, [[Emiko Queen|Red Arrow]], [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo&#39;s]] daughter Crush, and the immortal [[Jinn|spirit creature]] Djinn.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans Special&#39;&#39; #1 (2018), &#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; #20 (July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; This new team faces initial difficulties because of Red Arrow&#39;s criticism and the individualistic tendencies of several members. During a case in which [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] nearly detonates a nuclear device, Robin uses the ring to which Djinn is bound to grant her the use of her full powers to avert the crisis, and returns it afterwards, refusing to assume mastery over her. This earns him Djinn&#39;s trust, which gradually begins to turn into a mutual romantic attraction.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; #21 (August 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; However, what Damian does not tell his teammates is that a deep cellar of the Titans&#39; headquarters, a former juvenile detention facility, serves him as a secret dungeon to lock away the most dangerous criminals he captures for good, including [[Deathstroke]], Gizmo, [[Brother Blood]], [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], and [[Atomic Skull#Joseph Martin|Atomic Skull]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; #20 (July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nHis teammates are also unaware that he is working with [[Jason Todd]], who goes by the alias Outlaw.&lt;ref&gt;Lobdell, Scott (w), Woods, Pete (a), Peteri, Troy (let), Marie Javins, Rob Levin (ed). \&quot;Outlaw, Part One\&quot; &#39;&#39;Red Hood and the Outlaws&#39;&#39; 26 (November, 2018), New York: DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a miscommunication, Damian can no longer trust him, which ultimately leads them to cut ties.\n\nEventually, Kid Flash discovers the secret prison,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; #28 (March 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; and Crush, who [[LGBT themes in comics|has fallen for Djinn]], kisses her, showing her the kind of genuine affection which Damian in his grimness never really did.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; #29 (April 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; When the other Titans find out, and when Red Arrow kills Deathstroke,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Deathstroke&#39;&#39; #43&lt;/ref&gt; conflict erupts within the team until [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], looking for Crush, crashes in.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; #30-32 (May-July 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; Djinn defeats him by altering his memory, and proceeds to do so with the other criminals Damian captures, giving them new, harmless identities.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Teen Titans&#39;&#39; #33 (August 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Super Sons===\nIn this book Robin is teamed up with Superman&#39;s son Jonathan Kent. Together they team and become the Super Sons. In the first volume Damian and Jon team up to defeat Kid Amazo. Kid Amazo was a person affected by the Amazo virus a virus that grants humans powers. They defeat him and Damian decides to train Jon. Batman gives them an underwater base which later gets destroyed. Currently the team is over due to changes made to Jon&#39;s character.&lt;ref&gt;Superman #8 (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Skills and Abilities==\nHaving been trained by the [[League of Assassins]] since birth, Damian is already an expert in martial arts and in wielding a wide range of weaponry. Despite his age, Damian has taken on and bested trained fighters like Talia Al Ghul, Red Hood (Jason Todd), Red Robin (Tim Drake), and the Joker, amongst others. He was also trained in the disciplines of forensics, acrobatics, criminology, disguise and escapology. Damian is skilled in mimicking voices and speech patterns of others accurately, as he was able to imitate his father&#39;s and Tim Drake&#39;s voices in order to bypass the Batcave&#39;s voice-recognition security systems.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Batman #658\&quot;/&gt; Damian is shown to have highly advanced engineering skills, as he was able to complete his father&#39;s plans of building a flying Bat-mobile, the construction of which Alfred described as \&quot;being an endless source of frustration to Damian&#39;s father.\&quot; Damian is also a capable businessman despite his young age, being involved with [[Wayne Enterprises]] and its board members. He also has been trained in numerous weapons as shown in the &#39;&#39;Blackest Night&#39;&#39; event.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: Blackest Night&#39;&#39; vol 1 #2&lt;/ref&gt; Damian possessed superpowers similar to that of Superman following his resurrection, though this was short-lived. However, he is shown to possess healing abilities and powers in the future.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Robin (Damian Wayne).jpg|thumb|upright|Damian Wayne on &#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; #1 (August 2009). Art by Frank Quitely.]]\nAfter stealing [[Jason Todd]]&#39;s Robin tunic and mask from his memorial case, Damian&#39;s unofficial appearance as Robin was wearing them over his black and white League of Assassins bodysuit with a grayish hood and cape. He carried a pair of [[brass knuckles]], which he incorporated as part of this costume, and would also carry a sword.\n\nAfter Dick Grayson officially sanctioned Damian&#39;s role as Robin, while a standard Robin tunic was retained, the bodysuit was replaced with a black survival suit, the grayish cape with a yellow \&quot;para-cape\&quot; which grants him a [[gliding]] capability, the black mask with a green one, a bulkier utility belt to carry more weapons and gadgetry, a black hood, and green gloves and flexible boots.\n\nAs of age 13, Damian was short for his age and had few other markers of impending puberty. In [[Super-Sons|Super Sons]], it was a running joke that he was frequently mistaken as younger than ten-year-old [[Jonathan Samuel Kent|Jonathan Kent]].\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Further|Alternate versions of Robin}}\nReferences in current continuity have been made to the future of Bruce and Talia&#39;s son.\n\n* In &#39;&#39;[[DC One Million]]&#39;&#39; (1999), written by Grant Morrison, a Batman from the 853rd Century references a Dark Knight&#39;s battle with Two-Face-Two, which &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #700 (2010) depicts with Damian Wayne.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #700&lt;/ref&gt;\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Teen Titans]]&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #18 (2006), when the Teen Titans were transported 10 years into the future, a graveyard full of deceased Batman allies and villains is depicted.

However, after an antagonistic encounter with his estranged father and the new Batman, [[Batman (Terry McGinnis) | Terry McGinnis]] he reforms and partly reconciles with Bruce.\n* A Bizarro counterpart of Robin, named Robzarro, first appeared in the four-part story \&quot;Boyzarro Re-Death\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer=Patrick Gleason, Peter J.

This version is a stark departure from his original counterpart: his mother is [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]], he bears no intent to kill at all, acts much more like his father, and his costume is similar to [[Tim Drake]]&#39;s second Robin costume. Initially portrayed as being reluctant to follow in his father&#39;s footsteps, Damian tells his parents that he does not want them to plot out his own life for him. After his parents are killed by [[Joker (character)|Joker Jr.]] however, Damian takes up the Robin mantle and fights alongside [[Dick Grayson]] as Batman to bring Joker Jr. and the original Joker to justice. Following this, Damian goes on to fight the Club of Villains, Flamingo, and [[Professor Pyg]]. In his later years, Dick passes the Batman mantle to Damian, who is then shown fighting crime with his own child (voiced by Sebastian Bader) as the new Robin, who resembles [[Carrie Kelley]] from &#39;&#39;[[The Dark Knight Returns]]&#39;&#39;. This episode was based on a comic book story from the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] in which Batman was married to [[Batwoman|Kathy Kane]] and had a son named [[Alternate versions of Robin|Bruce Wayne Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #131&lt;/ref&gt;\n* The character is referenced in the &#39;&#39;[[Teen Titans Go!

In \&quot;Finding Mr. Right\&quot;, in an effort to improve his reputation, he appears on a talk show and lies about [[Harley Quinn]] agreeing to be his arch-enemy. Offended, Harley kidnaps him and threatens to feed him to [[King Shark]] unless he confesses. Once he does, she reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain, humiliating him. However, Damian suffers a nosebleed, and King Shark goes berserk after smelling it. While he is saved by his father Batman, Joker temporarily kidnaps him before Batman saves him again. The dark knight later comforts Robin and assures him he can wait until he is ready for his own nemesis. In the season two premiere \&quot;New Gotham\&quot;, Damian took up the mantle of Batman after he disappeared in the chaos caused by Joker&#39;s destruction of Gotham during the season one finale despite not being old enough to do so.\n\n===Film===\n* Damian Wayne has a major role in &#39;&#39;[[Son of Batman]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Stuart Allan]].\n* Damian Wayne also appears in &#39;&#39;[[Batman vs. Robin]]&#39;&#39; as a sequel to &#39;&#39;Son of Batman&#39;&#39;, with Stuart Allan reprising his role.\n* Damian Wayne appears in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Bad Blood]]&#39;&#39;, a sequel to &#39;&#39;Son of Batman&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Batman vs. Robin&#39;&#39;, with Stuart Allan reprising his role.

In the alternate universe ruled by Superman&#39;s One Earth Regime, an adult Damian has assumed the mantle of &#39;&#39;&#39;Nightwing&#39;&#39;&#39; after accidentally killing Dick Grayson and joined the Regime. He first appears leading a Regime attack alongside [[Shiera Sanders Hall|Hawkgirl]] on the Joker Clan at [[Arkham Asylum]], but is defeated by the mainstream version of Joker, who was accidentally teleported in this universe by the Insurgency. Nightwing later fights Batman at [[Stryker&#39;s Island]] during a break-in to rescue mainstream Batman. Upon defeating him, Batman claims that Dick was his son and that Damian is dead to him. At the end of the game, Nightwing is seen being arrested alongside the rest of the Regime following its defeat. In his non-canonical Arcade ending, after defeating Superman, Nightwing becomes more violent and cruel than ever before, catching [[Sinestro]]&#39;s attention, who convinces him to join the [[Sinestro Corps|Yellow Lantern Corps]] to bring more fear into the hearts of criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.igxpro.com/2013/04/08/new-injustice-footage-contains-major-spoiler-for-nightwing/1121707 |title=New Injustice Footage Contains MAJOR Spoiler for Nightwing |publisher=IGX Pro |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410234551/http://www.igxpro.com/2013/04/08/new-injustice-footage-contains-major-spoiler-for-nightwing/1121707 |archivedate=April 10, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Damian Wayne appears as a playable character in &#39;&#39;[[Injustice 2]]&#39;&#39;, now as both Robin and Nightwing and voiced by [[Scott Porter]]. Prior to the events of the first game, Damian, still known as Robin, accompanies Batman to stop the Regime from rounding up Arkham Asylum inmates to execute. Following an argument between Batman and Superman, Damian chooses the latter&#39;s side, believing in his cause to kill criminals, and leaves with him to join the Regime, not before executing [[Victor Zsasz]] as a show of trust. In the present, Nightwing is released from Stryker&#39;s Island alongside Superman and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] by [[Wonder Woman]], [[Black Adam]] and [[Supergirl]], and given his gear back. He then fights and is defeated by either [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] or [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]], attempting to stop the breakout. Afterwards, he reluctantly joins forces with the Insurgency to defeat [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], and is later defeated by Supergirl while attempting to stop her from leaving the [[Fortress of Solitude]] after she learned about the Regime&#39;s true nature. In his Arcade ending, Damian, wearing his Robin costume, witnesses Batman dying to save him from Brainiac. Following Brainiac&#39;s defeat, Damian realises he misjudged his father and assumes the mantle of Batman to honor his legacy. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Robin}}\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{Teen Titans}}\n{{Grant Morrison}}\n{{Batman family tree}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wayne, Damian}}\n[[Category:Batman characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike W.
