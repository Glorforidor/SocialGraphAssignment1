Both were loosely based on trademarks of [[Atari, Inc.]]\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe first &#39;&#39;Atari Force&#39;&#39; comics, which only counted five issues, were published in 1982 and were created mainly to illustrate story lines for [[home console]] games being released by fellow [[Warner Communications]] subsidiary [[Atari, Inc.]]  The [[minicomic]]s were packed in with the games &#39;&#39;[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Star Raiders]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Phoenix (video game)|Phoenix]]&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;[[Galaxian]]&#39;&#39;. The comics were written by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Roy Thomas]] and the artists included [[Ross Andru]], [[Gil Kane]], [[Dick Giordano]], and [[Mike DeCarlo]].\n\nAn &#39;&#39;Atari Force&#39;&#39; [[DC Comics insert previews|special insert]] appeared in two comic books cover dated January 1983&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/37018/ &#39;&#39;DC Comics Presents&#39;&#39; #53] and [http://www.comics.org/issue/37028/ &#39;&#39;The New Teen Titans&#39;&#39; #27] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a prequel to the ongoing series launched a year later. The insert was the story previously published in the &#39;&#39;Phoenix&#39;&#39; minicomic, but the story title was changed to \&quot;Code Name: Liberator\&quot; and the featured ship&#39;s name became &#39;&#39;Liberator&#39;&#39;.  In addition, the art for the aliens showed them as more frog-like.  Atari released a &#39;&#39;[[Liberator (arcade game)|Liberator]]&#39;&#39; arcade game featuring Commander Martin Champion and the Atari Force name.\n\nIn 1983 [[DC Comics]] published a [[graphic novel]] version of the Star Raiders mini-comic; it was the first title of the &#39;&#39;[[DC Graphic Novel]]&#39;&#39; series. It was written by [[Elliot S! Maggin]] and illustrated by [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez]]. The graphic novel was a larger format than normal comic books, and reached a much larger market (via comic book specialty stores) than the small subset of persons who bought the 2600 cartridge. The graphic novel story may have also had more material than the original mini-comic, in addition to the larger format.\n\nThe second series (Jan. 1984 - Aug. 1985) was released monthly, in conventional comic-book format, and lasted for 20 issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicvine.com/atari-force/65-44194/issues-cover/ Atari Force comic books - Comic Vine]&lt;/ref&gt; Gerry Conway returned as writer while [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez]] became the main pencil artist. However, original series concept artist Ross Andru did draw issues 4\u20135. In issue #13, [[Eduardo Barreto]] took over as penciler and, in #14, [[Mike Baron]] became the regular writer through the final issue, #20. Issues 12-20 also featured backup stories by different writers and artists. In 1986, a \&quot;Special\&quot; issue was released with work by different creators, some of whom had done backup stories for volume 2. The backup story of issue #20, \u201cHukka vs. the Bob!\u201d by [[Keith Giffen]], [[Robert Loren Fleming]], and [[Karl Kesel]], was reprinted in the Best of DC #71 digest, containing the Year&#39;s Best Comics Stories, in April 1986, and was voted as one of the best comic book stories of the year in Comics Buyers Guide magazine, among others.\n\nIn July 2015, [[Dynamite Entertainment]]  announced that they would reprint the comic book and new series based on Atari properties: &#39;&#39;[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Crystal Castles (video game)|Crystal Castles]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Missile Command]]&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;[[Yars&#39; Revenge]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/06/atari-returns-to-comics-at-dynamite-entertainment|title=Atari Returns To Comics At Dynamite Entertainment|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Couto, Anthony|date=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Plot ==\nThe original Atari Force was a team of humans from different nations using the multi-dimensional starship &#39;&#39;Scanner One&#39;&#39; to search for a new planet for humanity to inhabit as the Earth was facing ecological devastation.  The team was handpicked by A.T.A.R.I. (Advanced Technology and Research Institute), and consisted of Martin Champion as mission commander, Lydia Perez as pilot and executive officer, Li-San O&#39;Rourke as security officer, Mohandas Singh as flight engineer, and Dr. Lucas Orion as medical officer.  A semi-sentient alien creature, named Hukka because of the noise he made, later joined as team [[mascot]].\n\nThe second team, formed approximately 25 years after the first, was also led by Martin Champion.  He was convinced that the original team&#39;s nemesis, the Dark Destroyer, still existed.  Although he was correct, most of the rest of humanity did not believe it, but humored him due to his heroic status in successfully leading the original Atari Force to find New Earth.  Other team members included [[Tempest (DC Comics)|Christopher \&quot;Tempest\&quot; Champion]], son of Martin Champion and Lydia Perez; Erin \&quot;Dart\&quot; Bia O&#39;Rourke-Singh, daughter of Mohandas Singh and Li-San O&#39;Rourke; Hukka; [[Morphea (comics)|Morphea]], an [[insectoid]] [[empathy|empath]]; Babe, an alien [[toddler]] of immense size and strength; and Pakrat, a humanoid rodent [[thief]].  Later additions to the team were Blackjak, Dart&#39;s human lover; Taz, a short alien warrior; and Kargg, the Dark Destroyer&#39;s former chief underling.\n\n== Collected editions ==\n* &#39;&#39;Atari Force Trade Paperback&#39;&#39; November 15, 2017, {{ISBN|978-1524105389}}\n\n==References==\n {{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/comics/AtariForce/ Atari Force Headquarters] - a fan site that offers far more information on the series.\n\n[[Category:1982 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:1986 comics endings]]\n[[Category:Comics based on video games]]\n[[Category:DC Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Science fiction comics]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gerry Conway]]\n[[Category:Comics by Paul Kupperberg]]\n[[Category:Dynamite Entertainment titles]]\n[[Category:Space opera comics]]&quot;</span>
