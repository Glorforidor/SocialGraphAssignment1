As in issue #1, the Red Skull's secret identity is George Maxon, the owner of the Maxon Aircraft Company that makes airplanes for the US Army. Maxon wears a mask to create the look of the Red Skull and his face is often exposed. As the Red Skull, Maxon commandeers bank robberies in an effort to raise money to overthrow the US government, declaring, \"Of course you realize the main item in overthrowing the government is money!\"\n\nStories published decades later established that the Red Skull appearing in ''Captain America'' #7 (October 1941) was the Nazi Johann Schmidt, and that the Red Skull appearing before that point was his pawn George Maxon.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Richard A.|title=The American Superhero: Encyclopedia of Caped Crusaders in History|page=221-222|date=2019|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpuDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=%22George+Maxon%22+red+skull+%237&source=bl&ots=eLW7jTbadE&sig=ACfU3U3BbBI9tS8DoNmM40jzMnk1QljpfQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtrL60-5XqAhWFhHIEHYcTCv0Q6AEwDXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22George%20Maxon%22%20red%20skull%20%237&f=false|accessdate=June 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter an absence from comics for many years, both Captain America and the Red Skull were brought back in 1954 in ''Young Men Comics'' #24, in a story entitled \"Back From The Dead\". Here the Red Skull, thinking Captain America was dead, has left politics and started a big criminal enterprise in the United States. In his next appearance, in issue #27, the Red Skull is once again left for dead.\n\nThe character returned in new stories starting with ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #65 (May 1965) in a Captain America [[World War II]]-period story run. Red Skull was established as a contemporary villain in issue #79 (July 1966), with the explanation that he had been in [[suspended animation]] since World War II.\n\nFor decades, the character's true face was hidden, but in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #297 (September 1984) the Red Skull unmasks in front of Captain America and his face, albeit extremely aged, is fully revealed. In the next issue, the Red Skull retells his story with his face fully visible in his various ages. When the character is revealed to be alive in issue #350 (February 1989), in a story called \"Resurrection\", by [[Mark Gruenwald]], the face of Johann Schmidt's original body is hidden again, but the Red Skull's face is fully visible, albeit in his cloned copy of Captain America's body.\n\nThe character's origin was more fully illustrated in the miniseries ''Red Skull: Incarnate'', with Schmidt's face fully visible again.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Johann Schmidt===\nJohann Schmidt was a Nazi general officer and confidant of [[Adolf Hitler]]. He has been closely affiliated with [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] and is an enemy of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the interests of the [[United States]] and the [[Free World|free world]] in general.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=296-297}}</ref> He was physically augmented by having his mind placed into the body of a [[Cloning|clone]] of Captain America, the pinnacle of human perfection. He has been seemingly killed in the past, only to return time and time again to plague the world with schemes of world domination and [[genocide]].\n\n====World War II era====\nJohann Schmidt was born in a village in [[German Empire|Germany]] to Hermann Schmidt and Martha Schmidt. His mother died in childbirth, and his father blamed Johann for her death. Johann's father tried to drown the baby, only to be stopped by the attending doctor; he later committed suicide, leaving Johann an orphan. The doctor took Johann to an orphanage, where the child led a lonely existence. Johann ran away from the orphanage when he was 7 years old and lived on the streets as a beggar and thief. As he grew older, he worked at various menial jobs but spent most of his time in prison for crimes ranging from vagrancy to theft. The Skull's real name of Johann Schmidt was not revealed in his [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] and Silver Age appearances.\n\nAs a young man, Schmidt was from time to time employed by a [[Jews|Jew]]ish shopkeeper, whose daughter Esther was the only person who had treated Schmidt kindly up to that point. Seized with passion for Esther, Schmidt tried to force himself upon her, only for her to reject him. In unthinking fury, Schmidt murdered her. Schmidt fled the scene in terror but also felt ecstatic joy in committing his first murder. In killing Esther, he had given vent to the rage at the world that had been building up in him throughout his young life.<ref name=\"Captain America #298\">''Captain America'' #298</ref>\n\nAccording to the official version of the story told by the Red Skull and the Nazis, Schmidt met Hitler while working as a [[bellhop]] in a hotel. This occurred during his late teens, around the same time that the [[Nazi Party]] gained power in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Schmidt wound up serving Hitler's rooms at the hotel. By chance, Schmidt was present by bringing refreshments when the F\u00fchrer was furiously scolding an officer for letting a spy escape, during which Hitler declared that he could create a better National Socialist out of the bellhop. Looking closely at the youth and sensing his dark inner nature, Hitler decided to act on his words and recruited Schmidt.<ref name=\"Captain America #298\"/> In the miniseries ''Red Skull: Incarnate'', it has been revealed that Schmidt actually engineered his meeting with the F\u00fchrer with himself disguised as a bellhop, tricking his fellow orphan Dieter into trying to kill Hitler and then taking this opportunity to save Hitler's life.<ref>''Red Skull: Incarnate'' #5</ref>\n\nDissatisfied with the standard [[Drill instructor|drill instruction]] his subordinates used to train Schmidt, Hitler took over personally, training Schmidt as his [[wikt:right hand man|right-hand man]]. Upon completion, Hitler gave Schmidt a unique uniform with a grotesque red [[Human skull|skull]] mask, and he emerged as the Red Skull (in literal German: ''Roter Totenkopf'' or ''Roter (Toten-)Sch\u00e4del'') for the first time. His role was the embodiment of Nazi intimidation, while Hitler could remain the popular leader of Germany. To that end, the Red Skull was appointed head of Nazi [[Terrorism|terrorist]] activities with an additional large role in external [[espionage]] and [[sabotage]]. He succeeded, wreaking havoc throughout Europe in the early stages of World War II. The [[propaganda]] effect was so great that the United States government decided to counter it by creating their own equivalent using the one recipient of the lost [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project Rebirth]]: Steve Rogers.<ref name=\"Captain America #298\"/>\n\nIn Europe during the war, the Red Skull took personal command of many military actions and personally supervised the takeovers and lootings of many cities and towns; in various cases the Red Skull ordered and supervised the eradication of the entire population of such communities. The Red Skull also organized a [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|Wolf Pack]] of U-Boats which preyed upon shipping across the world, often under the Red Skull's personal command.<ref name=\"Tales of Suspense #66\">''Tales of Suspense'' #66</ref>\n\nAt first, Hitler took great pride in his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's successes and let the Red Skull have anything he wanted. Hitler thus financed the construction of secret bases for the Red Skull in various locations throughout the world, many of which were equipped with highly advanced experimental weapons and devices developed by Nazi scientists. The Red Skull was particularly interested in procuring technological weapons that could be used for the purposes of subversion and warfare. During the war he stole plans for the nullatron, a device that could control human minds, adapted a space-warping device developed by the cyborg scientist code-named [[Brain Drain (comics)|Brain Drain]], and commissioned Nazi scientists to develop a projector which could encircle and suspend sections of cities within spheres of energy.\n\nBut while the Red Skull always admired Hitler for his ideological vision, he was never fully content with being Hitler's subordinate. The Red Skull kidnapped and killed many of Hitler's closest advisers and eventually rose to become the second-most-powerful man in the [[Third Reich]]. Now Hitler could no longer effectively control the Red Skull and came to fear him, especially since the Red Skull had made no secret of his ambition to supplant Hitler someday.\n\nAfter the renowned military officer [[Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] had a falling out with Hitler, the Red Skull sent Strucker to [[Japan]] to found an organization that would prepare the way for takeovers in the Far East under the Red Skull's leadership.<ref name=\"Tales of Suspense #66\"/> In the Far East, Strucker joined a subversive organization that came to be known as [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], severed his ties with the Red Skull, became head of HYDRA and made it into a major threat to world peace.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\nAs World War II raged on, Hitler vowed that if he could not conquer the world, he would destroy it. To achieve this end, the Red Skull proposed the construction of five gigantic war machines, to be called the Sleepers, which would be hidden in various locations while they generated and stored the power they would need, and then be released at a future date, \"Der Tag\" (\"The Day\" in German), to destroy the Earth if the Allies won the war. Hitler enthusiastically instructed the Red Skull to construct the Sleepers, unaware that the Red Skull intended to use them to conquer the world himself if Hitler's Third Reich fell. In the closing days of the war in Europe, Allied intelligence received reports of a Nazi [[Doomsday device|doomsday plan]], code-named \"Der Tag\", to be implemented after Hitler's defeat. However, the Allies had no idea what the plan entailed.\n\nCaptain America, often with teenage partner [[Bucky Barnes]], fought against, and thwarted, the Red Skull and his plans many times during the war. The heroes also fought the Red Skull when they were members of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]. Once they were captured by him and Captain America was placed under Nazi control by a drug and told to assassinate the supreme commander of the Allied armies in Europe, but thanks to Bucky he broke free.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #67</ref> During the final days of World War II in Europe, Captain America and Bucky were assigned to England to prevent desperate Nazi efforts at sabotaging Allied supply bases there.{{issue|date=November 2011}}The Red Skull sent a number of his subordinates who became known as the Exiles, and a large contingent of loyal German soldiers and their wives to a secret island base (\"Exile Island\"), where they would organize an army for use in the future.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe two counterparts soon clashed for the first time.<ref>''Adventures of Captain America'' #1\u20134</ref>The Red Skull later temporarily brainwashed three of the Invaders into serving him.<ref>''Invaders'' #5\u20136</ref> The Red Skull and Captain America continued to engage in a series of skirmishes throughout the war. On one occasion, the Red Skull captured Captain America and told him his origin. He placed Captain America under his control and tried to use him to kill a high-ranking officer, but with Bucky's help Captain America broke free.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #66\u201368</ref> Now that the German defeat was becoming a reality, the Red Skull was more determined than ever to obtain vengeance for his numerous personal defeats by Captain America and Bucky. The Red Skull assigned Baron [[Heinrich Zemo]] to go to England, and, under the cover of stealing an experimental Allied drone plane, to capture or kill Captain America and Bucky. However, the Red Skull was unaware that the Allies had just secretly parachuted Captain America into beleaguered Berlin to investigate \"Der Tag\".{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\nFinally, Captain America tracked the Red Skull down to his hidden bunker. The Red Skull was about to hurl an armed hand [[grenade]] at his nemesis when Captain America threw his shield at him. The grenade exploded, but the Red Skull was not killed, due to his body armor. He was, however, seriously hurt and partially buried in debris. Thinking he was dying, the Red Skull defiantly told Captain America that the Sleepers would avenge the Nazis' defeat. Then, suddenly, an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] attack on [[Berlin]] began. An Allied plane dropped a huge [[blockbuster bomb]] on the bunker, causing a cave-in that Captain America barely escaped. Captain America was picked up by the Allies and returned to England only to fall into Zemo's trap, which led to Bucky's supposed death and Captain America's falling into [[suspended animation]] for decades. Support pillars that crisscrossed over the Red Skull when the bunker caved in saved him from being struck by tons of rubble when the bomb hit. The cave-in also released an experimental gas from canisters in the bunker which put the Red Skull into suspended animation, during which time his wounds slowly healed.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #79</ref>\n\n====Post-World War II era====\n\n=====Modern era=====\n[[File:Skullcosmic.png|left|thumb|The Red Skull wielding the [[Cosmic Cube]]: ''Tales of Suspense'' #80 (Aug. 1966).

Captain America neutralizes all the machines in turn.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nJohann Schmidt is eventually rescued and revived from suspended animation in modern times by the terrorist organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] The Red Skull quickly subverts a cell to his own ambitions of world conquest and the death of Captain America. He steals the [[Cosmic Cube]] after taking control of its Keeper's mind with a device he planted while shaking hands, and reveals that he gave Baron Zemo the order to steal the bomb plane that led to Bucky Barnes's death. He had a rivalry with Zemo, and hoped to set his two foes against each other. Captain America learns, from the dying pilot of a plane that had been following the Keeper's plane, that the Cosmic Cube had been used to destroy the plane. Schmidt tells another A.I.M. member of his plans after getting a mind control device on him, then causes him to shoot himself. He fights Captain America again for the first time in years after getting the Cosmic Cube on an island. He begins sending Captain America to another dimension when Captain America offers to become his servant. The Red Skull encases himself in a golden suit of armor, and talks of creating a new order of knights. Captain America gets close to him while the Red Skull prepares to knight him. Captain America tries to get the Cosmic Cube, and in the fight the island splits apart from the Cosmic Cube's power, and the Red Skull falls off a cliff while trying to get the Cosmic Cube.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #79\u201381</ref> When Johann reappears, he and Albert Malik start to antagonize each other while both claiming the Red Skull identity.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Finally Malik is the victim of an assassination organized by the Red Skull, through a rogue agent of the [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourges of the Underworld]].<ref name=\"Captain America #347\">''Captain America'' #347</ref>\n\nThe Red Skull captures part of Manhattan Island,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #88\u201391</ref> unleashes the fourth Sleeper, and captures Captain America on Exile Island.<ref>''Captain America'' #101\u2013104</ref> The Red Skull then regains the Cosmic Cube and temporarily switches bodies with Captain America.

Now physically weak and feeble in his mid-80s, the Red Skull plans a final showdown with his archrival. Kidnapping Captain America's closest allies, he forces Captain America to surrender himself to a medical treatment that ages his body to its rightful age. The two men, their bodies now ancient, fight a battle to the death. When Captain America refuses to kill him, the Red Skull dies in Captain America's arms, cursing his enemy as his elderly body shuts down.<ref>''Captain America'' #293\u2013300</ref>\n\n=====Resurrection=====\nNazi geneticist Arnim Zola had obtained DNA samples of Captain America years earlier and arranged for the Red Skull's mind to be transplanted into a cloned body of Captain America at the moment of his death. Assuming the identity of \"'''John Smith'''\" (the English equivalent of his natural German name), the Red Skull decides to reinvent himself and his quest for absolute power as a means to celebrate his cheating death. The Red Skull abandons his longstanding beliefs in National Socialism and Hitler, on the belief that the Nazi philosophy made him look like a relic of the past, and turns towards American ideology. The Red Skull sees much potential in the American dream of capitalism and self-determination and sets about establishing his own foothold inside Washington, D.C., culminating in him gaining control over the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]], a government body in Washington that monitors and regulates superhero activities.{{issue|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Red Skull also changes his mode of operations: rather than \"living from one grand scheme to the next\", he begins financing a score of evil organizations that report directly to him, such as the militia group the [[Watchdogs (Marvel Comics)|Watchdogs]]. He also employs one of the [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourges of the Underworld]], an organization dedicated to killing supervillains.{{issue|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Red Skull has the Commission remove Steve Rogers from the position of Captain America and replace him with [[Jingoism|jingoist]] [[U.S. Agent (comics)|John Walker]]. Although Walker attempts to live up to his predecessor's ideals, the Red Skull arranges for the murders of Walker's parents, driving him insane and into a downward spiral of murder as part of his plan to blacken the name of Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #346\u2013348</ref>\n\nThe Red Skull kills his chief pawn in the Commission right in front of Captain America. About to be exposed, the Red Skull tries to manipulate Walker into killing Rogers. When Rogers defeats Walker, the Red Skull appears to gloat at what he had done to Rogers, Walker, and the reputation of Captain America. However, Rogers remains openly dubious of his claims to be his dead archenemy. The Red Skull tries to kill Rogers with a cigarette holding a lethal dose of the dust of death (the Red Skull's favorite poison), but Walker hits him from behind with his shield. The Red Skull inhales the dust of death and his face takes on the appearance of a living red skull; his head loses its hair and its skin shrivels, clinging tightly to his skull, and taking on a red discoloration. The Red Skull survives the exposure due to the effects of the [[Captain America#Fictional character biography|Super-Soldier Formula]].<ref>''Captain America'' #350</ref>\n\nAfter this, the Red Skull masterminds a conflict between the United States and [[Symkaria]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #325</ref> He joins the \"[[Acts of Vengeance]]\" conspiracy, but is attacked by the mutant terrorist [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], a [[Holocaust]] survivor who wants to punish him for his involvement in Hitler's regime. Magneto buries him alive with enough water to last a few months. The Red Skull remains imprisoned, close to death and beginning to see the error of his ways, until he is rescued by his henchman [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. Feeling ready to die in peace, the Red Skull requests to be taken to his private estate's bed, and for Captain America to come see him. Upon seeing his archenemy's face, the Red Skull is surprised to feel a sudden burst of hatred that reignites his will to live.<ref>''Captain America'' #364\u2013367, 369\u2013370</ref>\n\nThe Red Skull proposes an alliance with the Kingpin to bring a new designer drug to New York, but the Kingpin refuses to ally with the Nazi and the two engage in a drug war. He then defeats the Red Skull in hand-to-hand combat, sparing his life on the condition that he never come near the Kingpin's territory again.<ref>''Captain America'' #376\u2013378</ref> After the Red Skull's agents allow fellow Nazi Baron [[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]] to be reborn, the grateful Strucker allows the Red Skull the use of HYDRA resources.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #26</ref>\n\nThe Red Skull's tenure in Washington comes to an end when he is captured by [[Hauptmann Deutschland]], and taken to Germany to stand trial for crimes against humanity, stemming from his days as an agent of the Third Reich. The Red Skull narrowly escapes and is rescued by Arnim Zola, and forced to fake his death and go into hiding in a Rocky Mountain compound. He recruits the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], a move that alienates his minions and is further rocked when his chief henchman Crossbones kidnaps Captain America's girlfriend [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], resulting in Captain America finding the Red Skull's new lair. The Red Skull fires Crossbones and goes into hiding while the Viper, using funds she plied from the Red Skull as part of a scheme to use televisions across America to blind TV viewers, is defeated by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #387\u2013391, 393\u2013398</ref>\n\nThe Red Skull discovers that he is facing the same permanent paralysis that Captain America was facing due to their exposure to the Super-Soldier Formula.<ref>''The Avengers'' (vol. 3) #68</ref> When the evil scientist [[Superia]] offers Captain America a cure, Captain America refuses it because Superia said that Captain America would owe her. The Red Skull takes the cure and apparently kills Superia, then arranges for Captain America to be kidnapped by his remaining forces (including Sharon Carter, whom he found still alive and recruits), and given a blood transfusion that cures him.<ref>''Captain America'' #445</ref>\n\nCaptain America's recovery segues into a reluctant team-up with the Red Skull; a Nazi cult that worshiped Hitler as a god had discovered a Cosmic Cube that contained Hitler's soul, put there by the Red Skull himself. The two try to stop the cult from fully powering the Hitler Cosmic Cube, but the Red Skull opts instead to send Captain America (against his will) into the cube to kill Hitler, imprisoning Captain America in the cube while he uses its power to conquer humanity. Captain America escapes and uses his shield to sever one of the Red Skull's arms, causing him to drop the Cube. The Cube becomes unstable, destroying the Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' #445\u2013448</ref>\n\nTrapped in a hellish nightmare dimension and forced to serve as a bellhop to a world of non-European immigrants, the Red Skull's will ultimately is so great that he is able to escape his prison. As a result, the Red Skull now possesses limited reality-warping powers that make him a cosmic threat. He is further aided by [[Korvac]], posing as [[Kang the Conqueror]]. He is sent to [[Galactus]]'s ship to steal more power (particularly the power of omniscience), which would remove all limits to the Red Skull's reality-warping powers. The Red Skull is ambushed by Korvac, who steals his cosmic powers and banishes him back to Earth.<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 3) #13\u201319</ref>\n\nThe Red Skull later manipulates his way into the position in the form of [[US Secretary of Defense]] '''Dell Rusk''' (an [[anagram]] of \"Red Skull\") to develop a biological weapon he tested at [[Mount Rushmore]].<ref>''The Avengers'' (vol. 3) #65</ref> He is exposed and defeated by the Avengers. The [[Black Panther (Marvel Comics)|Black Panther]] beats him so badly that he breaks the Red Skull's jaw in half.<ref>''The Avengers'' (vol. 3) #70</ref>\n\n=====Aleksander Lukin=====\n[[File:Wsoldier11.jpg|thumb|125px|The Red Skull in Alexander Lukin's mind. Art by Steve Epting]]\nThe Red Skull was assassinated by the mysterious Winter Soldier, under orders from the renegade former Soviet general [[Aleksander Lukin]] wanting to possess the new Cosmic Cube the Red Skull had manufactured.<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 5) #01</ref> When the Red Skull was shot, he attempted to use the Cosmic Cube to switch bodies with Lukin to survive, but as the Cosmic Cube was still weak he only managed to transfer his mind into Lukin's body, so that the two enemies are trapped together, waging a constant war for dominance which the Red Skull seems to be progressively winning. During a plot to lure out Captain America, the Red Skull/Lukin recruited several German skinheads and made them the successors to [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]]. He then had these soldiers, dubbed the \"Master Race\", launch an attack on London, which was thwarted by Captain America, [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] and [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]]. Then, the Red Skull/Lukin activated a Sleeper, a robot programmed for mass destruction that was presumably created by Doctor Doom. The robot damaged a significant portion of the new London Kronas H.Q., and was ultimately destroyed by Captain America and Bucky. In the aftermath, the Red Skull sent a videotape, announcing to the world his return, followed by Lukin holding a press conference condemning the actions of both the Red Skull and Captain America, and supporting the [[Superhuman Registration Act|Superhero Registration Act]]. Then, in his office, the Red Skull introduced Lukin to his old/new associates [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nWith America's superheroes [[Civil War (comics)|divided over the act]], the Red Skull manipulates events to his own ends, with the aid of [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]], [[Doctor Doom]] and Arnim Zola. His plans involved the reunion of Captain America and his former lover [[Sharon Carter]] being manipulated by Faustus.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, the Red Skull puts his plans into action, arranging for Crossbones to shoot Captain America as he enters a courthouse in New York City; in the ensuing chaos, Carter, acting under Faustus's mental directive, assassinates Captain America. This is only the first phase of the Red Skull's plan. Upon the discovery of his identity as Lukin, the Red Skull fakes his death, and initiates the second phase of his plan: using the Kronas Corporation's vast holdings to economically cripple the United States, before having S.H.I.E.L.D. agents brainwashed by Doctor Faustus open fire on crowds of protesters in front of the [[White House]]. The Red Skull continues his assault by engineering a riot by placing Kronas security troops and drugged water in a protest on the [[Lincoln Monument]].<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 5) #33\u201335</ref>\n\nAll of this has apparently been to elevate his puppet politician, Gordon Wright, elevated in the public's eye with being credited as \"resolving\" the situations, as well as surviving a (staged) attack by the [[Serpent Squad]]. Once elected, Wright will lead the country directly into a police state secretly controlled by the Red Skull. The Red Skull also plans to transfer his consciousness into Sharon's unborn child, apparently sired by Steve Rogers himself and potentially having inherited his Project: Rebirth enhancements.<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 5) #36</ref>\n\nBoth schemes fail because of the impatience and incompetence of the Red Skull's daughter\u2014her near-fatal attack on Sharon causes her to lose the baby, and she intentionally botches her pseudo-assassination of Wright by attempting to kill him for real. As Faustus has surreptitiously tampered with Sharon's programming, she is able to rebel, and before escaping shoots Lukin to death. This is not the end of the Red Skull, since Zola had seconds earlier transferred his mind to one of the spare robotic bodies, but after having his current form damaged by the [[Captain America (William Burnside)|impostor Captain America]], he is unable to return to the Red Skull, essentially trapping him in his current robotic form for the time being.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #42</ref>\n\n=====''Captain America: Reborn''=====\nIt has been revealed that the Red Skull did not actually kill Steve Rogers, but trapped his body in a fixed position in space and time. He was planning on using Sharon Carter and a machine created by Doctor Doom to return his body back to their time, but since Sharon destroyed the machine, his body is now drifting through time and space.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #1</ref> Apparently, it is presumed that the Red Skull intended to transfer his mind into Rogers' body. [[Norman Osborn]] decides to assist in completing his plan, as a figurehead of Captain America leading [[Dark Avengers|his team of Avengers]] would increase popularity with as the Iron Patriot.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #2</ref> Sin and Crossbones find him and take him to Latveria in order to place the Red Skull's mind in a living body.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #3</ref>The Red Skull, Sin and Crossbones land in Latveria and Doctor Doom confronts them, saying that he would kill them if he was not a man of his word. Doctor Doom and Zola complete the machine and, after [[Victoria Hand]] brings Sharon to them, they strap her in. They activate the machine and soon Steve's body returns. When Steve opens his eyes, they are shown to be red, signifying that the Red Skull is now in control.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #4</ref> Rogers still resides in the body and during the Red Skull's invasion of Washington, D.C., he and Steve battle in the mind of Steve's body.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #5</ref> Steve eventually forces the Red Skull out, placing him back into his robot body. To prevent him from escaping the immediate area, Sharon hits the Red Skull with a shot of [[Pym particles]], making him a massive robot who cannot elude any pursuer's attention. While Rogers and the Avengers keep the Red Skull occupied with a team attack, he is destroyed by a missile barrage fired by Sharon on a hijacked A.I.M. battleship.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #6</ref>\n\n=====Return=====\nAfter Lukin was brought back from the dead by the Power Elite, a side effect has a fragment of the original Red Skull's mind also revived.<ref name=\":0\">''Captain America'' (vol. 9) #6.

In 1953, [[Soviet]] [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian]] [[KGB]] agent '''Albert Malik''' set up his spy/criminal organization in [[French Algeria|Algeria]] and assumed the Red Skull identity, pretending that he was the original, when he was actually serving Soviet interests, in ''Captain America Comics'' #61.<ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/rskul2.htm|Red Skull (Communist, Albert Malik)}}</ref> During the 1950s, he faced the [[Captain America (William Burnside)|then-active version]] of Captain America, who was also pretending to be the original. While the Captain and [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]] ([[Jack Monroe (character)|Jack Monroe]]) were placed into suspended animation when his flawed replicate of the Super-Soldier Formula seriously affected his and Bucky's minds, Malik continued his activities, and over time severed his links to the Soviet Union.<ref>''Solo Avengers'' #6</ref>\n\nHe was also responsible for the deaths of [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker and Mary Fitzpatrick-Parker]], the parents of [[Peter Parker]], tipped off by the supercriminal [[Gentleman (character)|Gustav \"the Gentleman\" Fiers]] to their spy status.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #5</ref><ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #366</ref>\n\nMalik was later killed by a [[Scourge of the Underworld]], operating on behalf of the original Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) disguised as a pilot.<ref name=\"Captain America #347\"/>\n\n====Sinthea Schmidt====\n{{main|Sin (Marvel Comics)}}\nSinthea \"Sin\" Schmidt is the daughter of Johann Schmidt who briefly adopts the Red Skull moniker after being scarred like her father.\n\n====Clone of Johann Schmidt====\nFollowing the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, the Red Skull mysteriously returns and assembles a team called the [[S-Men]]. The Red Skull's S-Men attack [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] at [[Professor X]]'s grave and steal the mutant's body. In his hideout, the Red Skull is then seen removing Professor X's brain in a plot to \"eradicate the mutant menace\".<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #1</ref> This Red Skull is revealed to be a clone of the original created by Arnim Zola in 1942 and held in [[cryogenic]] stasis in the event that Germany lost the war. Fusing part of Professor X's brain with his own, the Red Skull brainwashes the Scarlet Witch as part of a plot to wipe out the world's mutant population. Rogue attacks the Scarlet Witch and they fight until they both discover the lobotomized body of Professor X. The Red Skull arrives and reveals that he has fused his brain with Professor X's brain.<ref name=\"Uncanny Avengers #2\">''Uncanny Avengers'' #2</ref> Using Professor X's telepathy, the Red Skull provokes ordinary citizens of New York into a mass assault against even potential mutants, even managing to take control of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. However, his telepathy is still erratic, with the Red Skull being unable to completely control Captain America and an attack against him by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] cutting off his right hand and disrupting his powers long enough for Rogue and the Scarlet Witch to break free.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #3</ref> The team ultimately force the Red Skull to retreat after Rogue manages to temporarily disrupt his powers, [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] mockingly comparing the Red Skull to the jock who beats up gay kids to conceal his own homosexuality.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #4</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Magneto finds out that the Red Skull has turned [[Genosha]] into a concentration camp for mutants and still has Professor X's brain inside him. Magneto attacks the Red Skull, but is quickly stopped by the S-Men.<ref>''Magneto'' (vol. 3) #9</ref>The Red Skull mind-tortures Magneto with visions of those closest to the mutant suffering while being unable to do anything to stop it. After being freed by the Scarlet Witch, Rogue and Havok, he bites down on a vial beneath his skin of Mutant Growth Hormone, giving himself enough power to fight.<ref>''Magneto'' (vol. 3) #10</ref> When the Scarlet Witch, Rogue and Havok want to leave the island and alert the rest of the Avengers and the X-Men of what the Red Skull is doing, Magneto wants to stay and fight. Before they can do anything, the Red Skull appears.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #24</ref>The Red Skull now has the group mind-controlled. He plans on using the Scarlet Witch's power to shape reality in his image. He tells Magneto to bow if the Scarlet Witch were to remain alive, but Magneto performs a sneak attack enough to break the Red Skull's control over the others. After killing the S-Men, Magneto attacks the Red Skull, who then tells Magneto that Professor X's greatest fear was leading the X-Men. Magneto kills the Red Skull while the others look on in horror. Magneto believes everything is over, only for the Red Skull to appear as a giant called \"'''[[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]]'''\".<ref name= \"Uncanny Avengers #25\">''Uncanny Avengers'' #25</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to defeat the new Red Onslaught and his army of Stark Sentinels\u2014created from information acquired from Tony Stark during the time of the Superhuman Registration Act\u2014Magneto gathers a team of villains to try to take the Red Skull's forces by surprise.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: Axis'' #2</ref>The Scarlet Witch attempts to cast a spell that will 'invert' the Red Skull and bring out the part of Professor X that still exists in his brain.

The Red Skull was later taken away by Doctor Doom.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: Axis'' #9</ref>\n\nAs part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', it is revealed that the Red Skull is hiding in [[Avengers Mansion]] (now a theme hotel as the various Avengers teams have moved on to new bases) in a secret underground room along with Sin (whose original appearance has been restored) ever since he was defeated. He is nearly discovered when [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Deadpool]] investigate the room, but uses a psychic suggestion to convince them that the room is empty, as well as planting a command in Quicksilver's subconscious that will be triggered later.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 2) #6</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, the Red Skull infiltrates the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility Pleasant Hill by disguising himself as a priest named Father Patrick. As Patrick, the Red Skull secretly instigates an uprising of the facility's brainwashed inmates by manipulating Baron [[Helmut Zemo]] and the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] into restoring them to normal.<ref>''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #7</ref> In the aftermath of the battle with the villains at Pleasant Hill, the Red Skull founds his own version of HYDRA with Sin and Crossbones.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega'' #1</ref> Their first strike occurs when they use Kobik\u2014a sentient Cosmic Cube that once belonged to the Red Skull, now 'educated' to perceive HYDRA as a great organization\u2014to manipulate Steve Rogers's memories into believing of being a HYDRA sleeper agent since childhood,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Steve Rogers: Captain America'' #2</ref> although the Red Skull is unaware that the HYDRA-converted soldier now intends to stage a coup of the organization for his own ends.<ref>''Steve Rogers: Captain America'' #4</ref>\n\nThe Red Skull eventually mounts an assault on the Avengers, using previously-planted commands to take control of the team, but Deadpool is able to resist him long enough to place Magneto's old helmet on Rogue's head, rendering Rogue immune to telepathy long enough to knock the Red Skull out and take him to be operated on by the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].<ref name= \"Uncanny Avengers Vol. 3 #21\">''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 3) #21</ref> The fragment of Professor X's brain is extracted from the Red Skull, but although Rogers attempts to take custody of the fragment for his own ends, Rogue and [[Johnny Storm]] fly up and incinerate the brain fragment, leaving the Red Skull to be taken into 'custody' by Rogers.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' (vol. 3) #22</ref> Although he is rescued by Sin, Sin and Crossbones subsequently betray the Red Skull to prove loyalty to Rogers, who kills the clone for good by pushing him over the cliff outside the Red Skull's mansion with Rogers revealing never being loyal to the Red Skull from the beginning.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #15</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, the disheveled man in a torn World War II uniform that introduced himself as Steve Rogers, alongside people claiming to be \"Bucky\" and \"Sam Wilson\", encounters the Red Skull's clone who plans to taken them \"home\".<ref>''Secret Empire'' #5</ref> As the other Steve Rogers is hanging from a rope tied to a tree, he finds himself next to a rambling man. As the Red Skull's clone takes the rambling man away, he tells the other Steve Rogers that his time will come soon. The other Steve Rogers asks the Red Skull's clone where he is and the Red Skull's clone claims that they are in \"Hell\". He also states that they are nothing but ghosts that are remnants fading into death. The Red Skull's clone then uses a barbed bat on the other Steve Rogers' chest, stating that the only path to peace is death.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #6</ref>The Red Skull's clone is torturing the other Steve Rogers with a burning, thorn-wrapped piece of wood. The Red Skull's clone claims he is granting the other Steve Rogers \"peace\" and is about to deliver the killing blow to the other Steve Rogers. Before he can strike, the other Steve Rogers sees the beautiful blond girl he saw at the beginning of the series who was the same one that was poisoned and that he thought had died. He realizes there is still hope and evades the Red Skull's clone's attack. The other Steve Rogers then tackles the Red Skull's clone and they both plummet off the cliff into the water below. The Red Skull's clone calls the other Steve Rogers an idiot for his actions.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #7</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAlthough he has no superhuman abilities, the Red Skull possesses a high intellect and inventive genius and is a highly gifted subversive strategist and political operative. At one point, the Red Skull's mind inhabited a body cloned from Captain America's, which possessed the mutagenic alterations induced by the Super-Soldier Formula. He was thus endowed with a body that was in perfect physical condition, with strength, speed, durability, agility, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, balance and physical endurance that exceeded that of an Olympic athlete. Despite the scar tissue covering his face and head, his senses were still above-average. He has been shown as a superb martial artist, though he was never on par with Captain America himself; he was originally trained by German athletes appointed by Hitler. He is heavily trained as a skilled marksman with various forms of handguns and well-versed in the use of firearms and explosives.\n\nWhile sharing Alexander Lukin's body, he lost his superhuman abilities. Since then, he resides in one of the android bodies engineered by Arnim Zola, with enhanced endurance and resilience.\n\nHe typically armed himself with a trick cigarette that could fire a fatal poison gas\u2014his trademark \"dust of death\"\u2014toward his victim. The \"dust of death\" is a red powder which kills a victim within seconds of skin contact. The powder causes the skin of the victim's head to shrivel, tighten and take on a red discoloration, while causing all of his hair to fall out; hence the victim's head resembles a \"red skull\". He also carries a large arsenal of conventional and advanced firearms and explosives.\n\nAfter fusing his own brain with that of [[Charles Xavier]], the clone of the Red Skull gains powerful telepathic abilities.<ref name=\"Uncanny Avengers #2\"/> After being killed in a fight with Magneto, the Red Skull clone temporarily evolved into a psionic entity similar to [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], vastly increasing his original powers while also giving him new ones,<ref name=\"Uncanny Avengers #25\"/> ranging from material astral projection, total control over his psionic state producing tendrils, changing size and such, energy projection in the form of optic blasts, on top of greatly enhanced control over his psychic abilities being able to effect minds the world over to initiate worldwide hate.{{issue|date=July 2016}} After reverting to his original form, however, he later expressed frustration with this new power as it makes conquest too easy for him, realizing that he wants people to grovel before him of their own free will, rather than just making people mindlessly submit.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>The Red Skull eventually loses these abilities when he is captured by Rogue and taken to the Beast, who performs surgery on the Red Skull to extract the elements of Xavier's brain from his own.<ref name= \"Uncanny Avengers Vol. 3 #21\"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Earth-110===\nThe Red Skull allied with Doctor Doom, the Hulk, Magneto, Namor, and Ultron in order to take over Manhattan.<ref>''Fantastic Four: Big Town'' #1\u20134</ref>\n\n===''Heroes Reborn''===\nIn the [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]] universe, the Red Skull is revealed to be the banker of [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]]'s [[White supremacy|World Party]].

Ben Beckley took on the identity of the '''Skull''' (not the Red Skull as he had no idea who the Red Skull was) and set out to conquer the world, starting with a coast-to-coast drive across America. Using his power of control over the cerebrum (and thereby actions) of anyone, he gathered an army of thousands, only to come into conflict with Steve Rogers in his Captain America identity. Insulting Captain America as being old and out of date, the Skull spared him, but took several of Captain America's allies as part of his army.<ref>''Earth X'' #1\u20136</ref> After reaching New York City, the Skull was opposed by Captain America and other heroes, with Captain America breaking the Skull's neck in order to stop him.<ref>''Earth X'' #7\u20139</ref> Beckley would later be seen in the Land of the Dead with his father, [[Comet Man]], and would help the heroes to convince the dead that they were deceased.<ref>''Earth X'' #10</ref>\n\n===''Elseworlds''===\nIn the 1997 DC/Marvel special ''Batman and Captain America'', the Red Skull hires the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] to steal an [[atomic bomb]] during World War II.

However, his easygoing personality is a ruse. Around the age of 17, he kills over 200 men on the base and then cuts off his own face in rejection of his father, leaving a \"red skull\".<ref name=\"Ultimate Avengers #2\">''Ultimate Avengers'' #2</ref> As a final symbol of his rebellion against the system that created him, he assassinates President John F.

After decades of working as a professional assassin, the Red Skull joins [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] so that he and his men can steal the blueprints of the Cosmic Cube. There he finally meets Captain America and brutally beats his father. Before throwing Captain America out of a helicopter, the Red Skull reveals his true identity. At A.I.M. headquarters in Alaska, the Red Skull kills the lead officer and takes charge of the operation. Now in control of the Cosmic Cube, he gains great power. As a sadistic display of his power, he has the entire Alaskan A.I.M. team cannibalize each other. When the Avengers arrive on the scene and immediately attack, the Cosmic Cube imbues him with nearly unlimited power, making him absolutely invulnerable. Captain America arrives in a stolen Teleporter Jet, but the Red Skull forces the jet to crash.

Petra (disguised as a nurse) enters the room and shoots the Red Skull in the head, killing him.

He and the other villains are later sent back to Earth when Doctor Doom claimed the Beyonder's powers.\n* The Red Skull appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'', voiced by [[Mark Hamill]] in a German accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm|title=Comics Continuum|publisher=Comics Continuum|date=2009-07-28|accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref> He appears in the episodes \"Wrath of the Red Skull\" and \"World War Witch\". \n* The Red Skull appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Steven Blum]] in a German accent for the Red Skull and an Americanized-style tone for Dell Rusk's animated debut.<ref name=\"TVoRS\"/> During World War II, the Red Skull uses HYDRA's resources during World War II to abduct [[Germanic mythology|Nordic mythological]] beasts from the Nine Realms and subject them to their control. Although [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes]] thwarted his scheme, the Red Skull indirectly causes Captain America's suspended animation and Bucky's demise. In the present, he quietly returns as Dell Rusk, the Secretary of Defense and the leader of Code Red with the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Doc Samson]], the [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] and the Winter Soldier. He releases a biological weapon in New York and accuses the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] of having released the weapon. He sends the Code Red to arrest them while the Winter Soldier captures Captain America for the Red Skull. Thanks to [[Iron Man]] and the Winter Soldier, Captain America was able to defeat the Red Skull. With his Dell Rusk alias exposed to the public, the Red Skull is remanded to Hydro Base until his [[Sleeper (Marvel Comics)|Sleepers]] spring him out of prison. It is revealed that he turned his nemesis' partner into the Winter Soldier to be his brainwashed assassin that served him. Using his Sleeper robots, which combine into one equipped with a Nova Cannon, he attacks Washington, D.C.. As the Avengers fought the combined Sleeper, Captain America and the Winter Soldier fight the Red Skull in the Sleeper's head. The Red Skull appears to be victorious until the Winter Soldier damages the Sleeper's computer. The Avengers manage to defeat the Sleeper and capture the Red Skull.\n* The Red Skull appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]] in a German accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://family-room.ew.com/2013/05/08/marvels-avengers-assemble-on-disneyxd-exclusive-first-look/|title='Marvel's Avengers Assemble' on DisneyXD -- EXCLUSIVE FIRST LOOK|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}</ref> In the first season, he is the leader of the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]]. In the two-part pilot \"The Avengers Protocol\", the Red Skull appears before Captain America, much to Captain America's surprise. After seemingly vaporizing Captain America with a laser gun, the Red Skull is confronted by Iron Man. He escapes, however, thanks to having allied with [[MODOK]]. After the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] are reassembled to storm the Red Skull's base, it is revealed that Captain America is alive, but is hooked to a machine with the Red Skull. Captain America subsequently attacks Iron Man, revealing that he is the Red Skull, having mindswapped himself in order to live longer, while leaving his nemesis to die in his own dying body. But after a battle with the Avengers, the mindswap is reversed, and the two enemies are back in their own bodies. However, MODOK steals Iron Man's [[Iron Man's armor|armor and arc reactor]] for the Red Skull, rechristening himself the '''[[Iron Man's armor|Iron Skull]]'''. Throughout season one, the Iron Skull recruits [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], [[Attuma]] and [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] to join him and MODOK in the Cabal to beat the Avengers at their own game while obtaining the Tesseract. But the season finale revealed the Iron Skull intended to eliminate his allies under the farce that he was sending them into other dimensions as he takes the Tesseract. But he is eventually defeated, losing his Iron Skull suit to Iron Man as he retreats into a portal where he presents the Tesseract to [[Thanos]]. In season two, the Red Skull returns to Earth, having been tortured by Thanos (to the point of being a shell of his former self) with the Power Stone as the Avengers place him in their custody. After surviving the Winter Soldier's kidnapping attempt, the Red Skull is restored to his former glory and escapes during the chaos caused by the Time Stone's temporal disruptions. He escaped to Monster Island, thanks to an alliance with [[Dormammu]] to gain control over the [[Mindless Ones]]. He wanted to cover the whole island in an impenetrable magic force field to protect himself from Thanos, despite the loss of the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]]. He succeeded, but was kicked out from the island when [[Scott Lang|Ant-Man]] used [[Fin Fang Foom]] and arrested him. The Red Skull also made sporadic appearances in ''Avengers: Secret Wars'' and ''Avengers: Black Panther's Quest''. \n* The Red Skull appears in the summer 2013 Disney/Marvel animated special ''[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]'',<ref name=\"Phineas&Ferb\">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/19084/phineas_and_ferb_mission_marvel_preview|title=Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel Preview|date=July 18, 2012|accessdate=August 31, 2012|work=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722034455/http://marvel.com/news/story/19084/phineas_and_ferb_mission_marvel_preview|archivedate=July 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> voiced again by Liam O'Brien.<ref>{{cite web| last= Goldman |first= Eric|title=Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel Debut Date Announced| url= https://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/06/28/phineas-and-ferb-mission-marvel-debut-date-announced |website= IGN}}</ref>\n* The Red Skull appears in ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'', voiced again by Liam O'Brien.<ref name=\"TVoRS\"/> In the episode \"Days of Future Smash: Year of the Hydra\", when the [[Hulk]] followed the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] to World War II and met Captain America, they come across the Leader's plot to use a replica of [[Abraham Erskine]]'s lab to use gamma energy to turn the Red Skull into the Green Skull. The Green Skull manages to overwhelm Hulk and Captain America. While the Leader uses his gamma siphoner on the Hulk, the Green Skull frees Captain America in order to force him to surrender. This leads to an alternate present where the Leader rules HYDRA, uses a wheel-shaped device powered by the Green Skull, and fights the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. alongside an older Captain America. Thanks to a tactic from Captain America before the public mention of a surrender over the airwaves, the Hulk is freed, turning the gamma siphoner onto the Green Skull, regressing him back to the Red Skull. The Hulk then defeats the Red Skull and the Leader escapes, causing the HYDRA-dominated present to shift back to the real present.\n* The Red Skull appears in the ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes: Maximum Overload]]'' miniseries, voiced by [[Chi McBride]].<ref name=\"TVoRS\"/>\n* The Red Skull appears in ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]'', voiced by [[Motomu Kiyokawa]].<ref name=\"TVoRS\"/>\n* The Red Skull appears in ''[[Marvel Future Avengers]]'', reprised by Motomu Kiyokawa in Japanese and Liam O'Brien in English.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Film===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = RedSkull1990Film.png\n| width1 = 200\n| caption1 = [[Scott Paulin]] as the Red Skull in the 1990 film ''[[Captain America (1990 film)|Captain America]]''\n| image2 = Hugo Weaving as Red Skull.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| caption2 = [[Hugo Weaving]] as the Red Skull in the 2011 film ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''\n}}\n* The Red Skull appeared in the 1990 film ''[[Captain America (1990 film)|Captain America]]'', portrayed by [[Scott Paulin]].

Tadzio was a boy genius whose family was killed by Axis soldiers who subjected him to the Super-Soldier Formula, leaving him deformed and evil. The Red Skull launches a missile at Washington, but Captain America attacks the Red Skull's base. The Red Skull battles Captain America aboard the flying missile and is forced to cut off his hand to avoid death. After Captain America is trapped in ice, the Red Skull forms a criminal organization with his daughter Valentina Santis. The Red Skull attempts to brainwash the President, only to be stopped via a recording of his family's death.

Schmitt ordered Dr. Erskine to use the experimental Super-Soldier Formula on him. The unfinished formula had physically enhanced him, but had also permanently deformed him. He was exiled by Adolf Hitler, who gave him his \"Red Skull\" moniker. The Red Skull leads an incursion into Norway in 1942, where he recovers the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], an artifact once owned by the Norse God [[Odin (character)|Odin]] which contains the [[Infinity Gems|Space Stone]], and has his chief scientist [[Arnim Zola]] develop advanced weapons powered by the device. Ultimately, disillusioned with the Nazis, the Red Skull breaks away from the Nazi regime and establishes HYDRA as its own force against the Allies and Axis alike with aspirations of world dominion. [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] leads the fight as Captain America against HYDRA, forcing the group to retreat to their final base in the Alps. In 1945, the Red Skull launches his plan to destroy every major capital on the planet, starting with New York. He is defeated by Rogers on board his plane, the ''Valkyrie'', seemingly disintegrated by the Tesseract upon using the object.\n** [[Ross Marquand]] portrays the character in the 2018 film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/04/avengers-infinity-war-recast-a-character-and-you-probably-didnt-even-notice/|title=Avengers: Infinity War Recast a Character, and You Probably Didn't Even Notice|website=[[Gizmodo]]|last=Pritchard|first=Tom|date=April 26, 2018|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> Following the events of ''The First Avenger'', the Red Skull is revealed to have been transported to the planet Vormir, where his punishment is to serve as a \"stonekeeper\", guiding those who seek the [[Infinity Gems|Soul Stone]]. Because he had nothing to sacrifice, the Red Skull was unable to claim the Soul Stone himself. The Red Skull leads Thanos and [[Gamora]] to the nearby abyss and reveals that Thanos must sacrifice someone whom the Titan loves for the Infinity Stone; he tearfully murders Gamora.
