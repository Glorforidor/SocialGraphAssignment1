The third was in Action Comics #353 (August 1967).The Jack Kirby Atlas' first and only appearance prior to Superman #677 was in 1st Issue Special #1. James Robinson brought Atlas back in Superman #678. According to Robinson, Atlas is going to save humanity: "The way I like to look at him is like in the Marvel Universe, Namor is a hero but he really skates the fine line between being a hero and a villain, but he stays on the side of the hero. Atlas, skates that line between hero and villain but he ultimately always falls on the villain side". He continued to say that Atlas will become a major player in the Superman mythos moving forward and there will be some real twists to the character.One of the earlier characters named Atlas re-appeared in Grant Morrison's All-Star Superman, where a version of Atlas appears in issue 3. This Atlas is more closely based on the mythological figure of Atlas and competes with Superman and Samson to "win" Lois Lane, similar to the story in Action Comics #320 from January 1965.


== Fictional character biography ==
The Jack Kirby Atlas' family and people were slain by the raiders of Hyssa the Lizard King. Atlas was raised by a wise and mysterious traveller named Chagra. Because of an alien crystal carried by Atlas, Chagra theorized that Atlas was one of the people of the Crystal Mountain. Chagra agrees to help Atlas achieve his revenge, but only if Atlas leads him to the Crystal Mountain. Atlas grew up to become a protector of the innocent, but once King Hyssa was defeated, his petulance and darker nature came to the forefront.Atlas returns in Superman #677 as part of The Coming of Atlas storyline and his origin is retold in issue #678 where he is seen saving citizens of Metropolis he himself had endangered. He is currently working with a secret government project that intends to kill Superman. Atlas wants to defeat Superman and replace him as Metropolis' champion on his way to conquer the modern world. He fights the Science Police and Superman.  He holds the upper hand on Superman for most of the battle, but is interfered with by his dog Krypto, who seems to be powered by magic. Atlas eventually defeats Krypto and prepares to kill him only for Superman to re-enter the fight and defeat him with some magical enhancement from Zachary Zatara.
