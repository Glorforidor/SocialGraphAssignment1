They first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern]]&#39;&#39; #176 (May 1984) and were created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Dave Gibbons]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Demolition Team | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 98  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fictional character history==\nIn their initial appearance, the Demolition Team were hired by [[Congressman]] Jason Bloch to destroy the [[Los Angeles]] branch of Ferris Aircraft.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ferris employees were virtually defenseless against the team and their state-of-the-art weaponry provided by the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]]. Help finally arrived in the form of the mysterious [[Carol Ferris|Predator]] who defeated the entire team unaided.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt; It is assumed the Demolition Team were sent to prison soon after the incident.\n\nThe Demolition Team returned several years later with updated technology only to be handily defeated by the [[Blood Pack (comics)|Blood Pack]] after attacking a nuclear power plant in [[Germany]]. Hardhat later appeared committing crimes in [[Opal City]].\n\nRosie, together with several other scientific geniuses and cybernetic beings (Automan, Brainstorm, [[Doctor Cyber]], Ford, and [[Emil Hamilton]]), was for a brief period part of the composite cybernetic being known as &#39;&#39;&#39;Enginehead&#39;&#39;&#39;. However (if this story is still canon), the being seems to have been divided into the individual personalities again shortly after the events of the series &#39;&#39;Enginehead&#39;&#39; 1&amp;ndash;6 (2004).\n\nMost of the team met their end at the hands of the [[OMACs]] during the events of &#39;&#39;[[The OMAC Project]]&#39;&#39;, but Hardhat was seen alive in &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; #7. He is participating in the &#39;Battle of Metropolis&#39;, which was a supervillain first step to conquer the world.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-ency\&quot;/&gt;\n\nStill later, Hardhat was seen among the \&quot;forgotten characters\&quot; of [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]]. Other notables include [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], [[Geist (DC Comics)|Geist]], [[Gunfire (comics)|Gunfire]] and Merryman of the [[Inferior Five]]. As Merryman explains, Hardhat and all the other inhabitants came here to a realm of &#39;no stories&#39; because they were forgotten about in the real world. They all are rescued by Superman and assist in the battle against the cosmic threat of Mandrakk.&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;Final Crisis Superman Beyond 3D\&quot; #1-2 (October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Members==\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Hardhat&#39;&#39;&#39; - A former heavyweight [[boxing]] palooka from [[New York City]]. His powered helmet and harness made him into a human [[juggernaut]], currently a resident of [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]].\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Jackhammer&#39;&#39;&#39; - A former [[Oil platform|oil rig]] worker from [[Houston]]. He carried a larger, more powerful version of a [[jackhammer]] capable of untold destruction. He is not to be confused with a similarly named character (real name Jackson Hammersmith) who employed an armor suit with two hydraulically charged hammer pistons against Superman while he had been weakened by [[Blaze and Satanus|Lord Satanus]] and Syren for a time.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Rosie&#39;&#39;&#39; - Leader of the Demolition Team. A former, no-nonsense bar owner in [[New Orleans]], she brandished a rapid-fire hot [[rivet]] gun.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Scoopshovel&#39;&#39;&#39; - A former professional [[jai-alai]] player from [[San Diego]]. His [[hydraulic]] power-arm allowed him to dig up almost anything.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Steamroller&#39;&#39;&#39; - A former [[motorcycle]] stunt rider from [[Chicago]]. He rode a compact version of a [[steamroller]] that could flatten buildings.\n\n==In other media==\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]&#39;&#39; series, a character named Steamroller is a cybernetic villain and a member of [[H.I.V.E.]] and [[Brotherhood of Evil]].\n* The Demolition Team appears in the fourth season of &#39;&#39;[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]&#39;&#39; with Rosie portrayed by [[Rachel Luttrell]], Hardhat portrayed by Marc Trottier and Jackhammer portrayed by [[Daniel Cudmore]]. Scoopshovel and Steamroller are absent from the team. This version is a team of mercenaries that specialize in destroying buildings. In \&quot;Code of Silence\&quot;, the team is hired by [[Damien Darhk]] and [[H.I.V.E.]] to kill [[Larry Lance|Quentin Lance]] by destroying a building that he&#39;s in, but were stopped by Team Arrow. The Demolition Team managed to escape and try to destroy the building where a mayoral debate between Oliver Queen and Ruve Adams is taking place. Ruve, Damien Darhk&#39;s wife, orders the Demolition Team to kill Oliver, but they were defeated by Team Arrow and arrested by the police.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\nThe Demolition Team appears in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; comic (based on the animated series of the same name) #43.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Green Lantern}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillain teams]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Len Wein]]&quot;</span>
