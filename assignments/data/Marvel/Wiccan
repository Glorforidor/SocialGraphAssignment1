Created by writer [[Allan Heinberg]] and artist [[Jim Cheung]], the character first appeared in ''Young Avengers'' #1 (April 2005).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=408}}</ref> The character's appearance is patterned on that of two prominent Marvel superheroes, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Scarlet Witch]], both of whom are members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Like the Scarlet Witch, Wiccan possesses powerful magical abilities which make him a key member of his superhero team.\n\nRecruited to the Young Avengers by [[Iron Lad]], Wiccan's story includes the discovery that he and  fellow teen hero [[Speed (comics)|Speed]] are in fact long-lost twin brothers, and that the pair are the sons of Scarlet Witch and her husband [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. Significant storylines for the character include him and his brother's search for their missing mother, learning to master his powers, and an ongoing relationship with his teammate [[Hulkling]].\n\nAlongside his permanent role as a member of the Young Avengers, Wiccan has also been a member of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Avengers Idea Mechanics|Avengers Idea Mechanics]] and  [[Strikeforce (comics)|Strikeforce]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | footer = The creators of Wiccan: writer Allan Heinberg (left), and artist Jim Cheung (right)\n   | image1 = Allan Heinberg.jpg\n   | width1 = 138\n   | image2 = 10.8.16JimCheungByLuigiNovi1.jpg\n   | width2 = 150}}\nWiccan first appeared in ''Young Avengers'' #1 (April 2005).  The issue was scripted by [[Allan Heinberg]] and drawn by [[Jim Cheung]]. One of the original four members of the Young Avengers, the team was founded after the Avengers disbanded in the story line ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]''.\n\nInitially, Heinberg assumed that Marvel would not allow him to write two leading homosexual characters. Because of this, he originally planned to write Billy's love interest, Hulkling, as a female shapeshifter named Chimera. Chimera would discover that her true form was male, which would force Billy to decide if he was still in love with him.<ref name=HeinbergInterview>{{cite web | last =Johnston | first =Rich | authorlink =Rich Johnston | title =Allan Heinberg \u2013 The Gay Times Interview | publisher =[[Bleeding Cool]] | date =February 24, 2011 | url =http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/02/24/allan-heinberg-the-gay-times-interview/ | format = Interview | accessdate = February 26, 2014}}</ref> However, due to the complexity of this proposed story line, editor [[Tom Brevoort]] suggested simply making both characters gay.<ref name=HeinbergInterview />\n\nWiccan  appeared in the new 2013 ''[[Young Avengers]]'' series by [[Kieron Gillen]] and [[Jamie McKelvie]].<ref name=\"YoungAvengers\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41439 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Gillen & McKelvie Assemble New Volume of \"Young Avengers\" |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=9 October 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the [[All-New All-Different Marvel]] rebranding, Wiccan (along with Hulkling) appears as a member of the [[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]] led by [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] along with [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], [[Squirrel Girl]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]] and [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The New Avengers Take A.I.M.|author=Jim Beard|date=August 17, 2015|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/24879/the_new_avengers_take_aim|archive-url=https://archive.is/20151120043516/http://marvel.com/news/comics/24879/the_new_avengers_take_aim|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 20, 2015|work=Marvel.com}}</ref> He later guest-starred in the [[Scarlet Witch]] series written by [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]].\n\nIn 2019, he will star in ''Strikeforce'' alongside [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], [[Angela (comics)|Angela]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], [[Monica Rambeau]], [[Daimon Hellstrom]] and [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]].<ref>https://www.newsarama.com/45536-strikeforce-promises-to-do-marvel-s-dirtiest-jobs.html</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBilly Kaplan is the eldest of three sons born to Jeff Kaplan, a [[Cardiology|cardiologist]],  and Rebecca Kaplan, a  [[psychologist]].\n\nRegularly [[Gay bullying|bullied in school because of his homosexuality]], Billy found solace outside the gates of the Avengers Mansion. One day, Billy encountered the Avenger the [[Scarlet Witch]], who told him to stand his ground the next time it happens. She then touched his head, causing a red light to flash briefly. The flash healed Billy's wounds, and a few weeks later, he stood up for another kid being bullied, demonstrating his [[mutant]] powers for the first time, and nearly killing his tormentor.<ref name=YASpecial />\n\n===Young Avengers===\nHe was one of the Young Avengers chosen as a result of the [[Iron Lad]]'s plan for the reformation of the Avengers, in the event the team ever disbanded. He originally chose the code name '''Asgardian''', but later changed it to '''Wiccan'''.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is unknown, though they include flight and lightning generation. He can cast spells using a technique learned from \"[[Self-help|self-help books]]\" owned by fellow Young Avenger [[Hulkling|Hulkling's]] mother.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Allan Heinberg| penciller=Jim Cheung| inker=John Dell| story= Sidekicks (Part 5).|title=Young Avengers| volume=1| issue=#5| date=August 1, 2005| publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> By chanting a mantra/statement of intent (for example, \"I want Iron Lad to forget\") and focusing on the outcome he wants to achieve, he can manipulate reality, causing certain events and effects to happen.\n\n===Family Matters===\nBilly has said that Wanda Maximoff, the [[Scarlet Witch]], was his favorite Avenger, and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers. Billy's possible relationship to Wanda was revealed by the [[Super-Skrull]] and Vision.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the past, the Scarlet Witch used her reality warping powers to create twin sons, unknowingly, from two (of five) scattered fragments of the soul of the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] that were previously lost to him in an ill-fated encounter with the powerful mutant child, [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]].<ref name=\"Fantastic Four No. 277 Apr. 1985\">{{cite comic| writer=Byrne, John| penciller=Byrne, John | inker=Jerry Ordway| story=Back from Beyond.| title=Fantastic Four | issue=#277| date=April 1, 1985| publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}.</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story= I Sing of Arms and Heroes...| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= 51| date= Mid-November 1989}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story=  Fragments of a Greater Darkness| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= 52| date= December 1989}}</ref> When the boys' souls were reabsorbed into Mephisto, because of the power Wanda put into the soul fragments, they destroyed him and their souls were reincarnated as [[Speed (comics)|Thomas Shepherd]], the Young Avenger '''Speed''', and Billy.\n\n===Civil War===\nDuring the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Billy and Tommy plan to look for Wanda.  [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] arrests the Young Avengers. However, [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson (Falcon)]] and [[Captain America|Steve Rogers (Captain America)]] intercept the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which is transporting the prisoners and Wiccan teleports the team out of the situation, into the Resistance Fighters base of operations.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Mark Millar| penciller= Steve McNiven| inker= Dexter Vines| title= Civil War| volume= | issue= #2| date= August 1, 2006}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] try to stay out of the conflict, they barely manage to escape from the government forces. Hearing of this development in the news, the Young Avengers decide to help the Runaways even though Captain America vetoes the plan. Wiccan uses his magic to locate and teleport to the Runaways. However, the Runaways believe that the Young Avengers have come to capture them and a fight ensues until Eli Bradley ([[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]]) succeeds in convincing [[Nico Minoru]] to stop the hostilities. The two teams are later attacked by [[Noh-Varr]], who captures Wiccan, [[Karolina Dean|Karolina]], and [[Hulkling]], and (apparently) kills the Runaway [[Xavin]]. The young heroes become the prisoners of the Warden, who proceeds to practice [[vivisection]] on the unconscious Teddy. The boys are rescued by Xavin, whose [[Skrull]] physiology allowed him to recover from Noh-Varr's attack. He comes close to killing the Warden, but Teddy stops him.<ref>''Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways''. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWiccan is among the Secret Avengers who takes part in the first major battle of the Civil War and was one of the first two casualties. [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] realize that the two rebels with [[teleportation]] powers needed to be incapacitated to prevent an escape from the ambush. So, Wiccan and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] are shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious. This attack on two of his youngest followers infuriates Steve Rogers ([[Captain America]]). A violent battle ensues, by the end of which, [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]] lies dead, slain by [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]], the [[cyborg]] [[Cloning|clone]] of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Most of the Anti-Registration group escapes, but Wiccan is left behind and captured by the Pro-Registration side.<ref>''Civil War'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBilly and the other imprisoned anti-Registration heroes are eventually freed in a raid led by Captain America. This liberation is made possible largely by Teddy's shape-shifting ability, which allows him to mimic [[Hank Pym]]'s retinal and voice patterns, and thereby release all the prisoners from their cells.<ref>''Civil War'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBilly is shown to be a member of the Initiative, along with Hulkling. However, it is later revealed that some, perhaps most, of the Young Avengers did not actually join The Initiative or even register.  They were registered by their [[Earth-A]] counterparts; both Wiccan and Hulking are seen complaining about being registered to their \"A Selves\".<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 3 #21. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>[http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=7066 SHE-HULK #21 - Marvel Comics Publishing Catalog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIt's been subsequently shown that since registration, Billy has spent most of his time at home, apparently grounded, with his parents wanting him to register.<ref>''Young Avengers Presents #1''. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===The Search for the Scarlet Witch===\nWiccan and Speed later search for the Scarlet Witch following the events of Civil War.  While Billy and Tommy both search for Wanda (referring to her as \"Mom\") they encounter [[Master Pandemonium]], who recognizes Wiccan's magic as that of the Scarlet Witch and further explains their original history as the Scarlet Witch's children. However, he likens the boys' search for their past and Wanda to his own former life as rising actor, and tells them that their past was \"darkness and chaos\" and advises them that they should embrace who they are now. This appears to have satisfied Wiccan, who calls off his search for now, deciding that he is happy with the person he is and the people in his life.<ref>''Young Avengers Presents'' #3 (March 2008).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===The Children's Crusade===\nDuring a fight between a group of nuclear-armed [[Sons of the Serpent]] and the Young Avengers, Wiccan loses control of his powers and renders the entire group of terrorists comatose. The Avengers arrive and take Wiccan to their base stating that they want to examine his full capabilities, concerned that, like the Scarlet Witch, if he were to lose control of his powers, he could cause massive devastation. In the process, the Avengers reveal to the team that the Scarlet Witch, having gone insane after losing her twin sons, killed several of her teammates, changed all of reality into [[House of M]], and then was responsible for the depowering and deaths of millions of mutants. Wiccan reiterates his belief that he and Speed are truly the transposed souls of the Scarlet Witch's children and that she may not have been purposefully behind those events. Seeing the Avengers' and his friends' distrust of the Scarlet Witch and their discomfort with him due to uncertainty of his powers, he storms out, only to find that Captain America has informed his parents of what occurred during the early battle. Wiccan, accompanied by Hulkling, goes with [[Captain America]] and is situated for observation. However, the other Young Avengers decide to break them out, urging Wiccan to search for the Scarlet Witch. By showing her that the children she lost may be alive and well, the Young Avengers believe that she may be cured of her madness and be able to reverse the damage she had done. In particular, [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]] hopes that locating and curing the Scarlet Witch could mean a chance at reviving [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|her father]]. Immediately, [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] arrives, stating that he wants Wiccan and Speed to finally know him as their grandfather.<ref name=\"ACC1\">{{Cite comic| writer = [[Allan Heinberg]]| penciller = [[Jim Cheung]]| inker = [[Mark Morales (artist)|Mark Morales]]| story = Avengers: The Children's Crusade| title = Avengers: The Children's Crusade| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = July 2010| publisher = Marvel Comics| location =| page =| panel =| id =}}</ref>\n\nHowever the Avengers intercede in the conversation and go into battle with Magneto and the Young Avengers. Wiccan is attacked by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and is then convinced by [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]] that this is a battle they cannot win. Wiccan then teleports his team and Magneto to Wundagore Mountain in Transia, The Scarlet Witch's birthplace, leaving the Avengers behind, who decide to let Wiccan find the Scarlet Witch so they can take care of both of them at once. Upon arriving, Patriot lashes out in anger at Wiccan, but Hawkeye intercedes and decides that they will look for the Scarlet Witch together. Patriot then confides with Hawkeye that he believes the Avengers are right and that they need to go back. However Hawkeye tells Patriot that he needs to pick a side and walks away angry. The Vision confides his fear that Stature may sacrifice herself to bring back her father, and that that is something that neither he nor her father would want. Finally, the group reaches the Grave of Magda, Wanda's mother, and Magneto tells the children about the Scarlet Witch and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver's]] birth. Wiccan then reaches out with his magic and finds the Scarlet Witch in the town, and Speed goes to investigate, only to run into Quicksilver. Quicksilver then threatens Magneto and kidnaps Wiccan. Speed however catches up with Quicksilver and the two race, with Wiccan being carried by Quicksilver the whole time. Eventually, Quicksilver decides that the only way to stop his father and get Wiccan to help him find his sister is to kill Magneto. He fashions out stakes using fence posts and runs back to the village, throwing wooden stakes at Magneto, who dodges them. In the process, Quicksilver seemingly impales Wanda, who is discovered to be a Doombot, and that [[Doctor Doom]] has the real Scarlet Witch.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThat night, everyone, Magneto and Quicksilver included, debates over invading Latveria to retrieve the Scarlet Witch, and they decide to sleep on it until the morning. Wiccan secretly leaves the group and is in the middle of a spell to teleport himself to Latveria. Quicksilver interrupts him, pointing out their similarities and again trying to get Wiccan to help him. However, Hulking arrives with the rest of the Young Avengers, threatening Quicksilver and reprimanding Wiccan. Meanwhile, the Avengers meet with [[Wonder Man]], hoping to use him to find Wanda and Wiccan. Simon, however, refuses and decides to go and find Wanda himself and help bring her back. Late that night in Transia, Wiccan writes a note for Hulkling expressing his love and apologizing for leaving for Latveria alone. Wiccan then teleports to Doom's castle and disguises himself as the Scarlet Witch to gain access. He is escorted by [[Doombot]]s to a room where he is then assaulted by an amnesiac Scarlet Witch. Wiccan tells Wanda that he plans to rescue, omitting that he is her son. However, Wanda states that there is no need for that as she is about to be married. [[Doctor Doom]] then arrives to tell Wiccan that it is he whom Wanda will marry, and then attacks Wiccan.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWiccan tries to tell Wanda about her past life as the Scarlet Witch, but Doctor Doom knocks him unconscious during the battle before Wiccan can finish. Later, Doom tells Wiccan that Wanda came to him, and although he does not understand how, he has truly fallen in love with Wanda. Later, Wanda comes to see Wiccan asking him to tell her everything about the Scarlet Witch before she marries Doom. In the meantime, Magneto and the Young Avengers plan to invade Doom's castle in order to get Wiccan back, but are stopped by Wonder Man, and the Avengers who followed him secretly. A battle ensues, and Wolverine goes to find Wanda and Wiccan to kill them, but is stopped by Iron Lad, who states that the future depends on Wiccan's survival.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nEventually Wanda recovers her memory and powers. Billy asks her to use her magic to determine whether or not they are truly mother and son. It becomes clear that they are, and Wanda begs Billy's forgiveness. Mother and child embrace lovingly and weep for joy. Wanda is now determined to undo the harm she did, and restore the mutants. The first beneficiary is [[Rictor]].<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHowever, the [[X-Men]] intervene, and as the Avengers arrive, the two teams fight. Wanda teleports herself and the Young Avengers back to Latveria. Wiccan decides to help Doctor Doom and Wanda cast a spell to give the mutants back their powers. However, Patriot refuses to trust Doctor Doom, and shoots an explosive arrow at him to stop the spell, which results in Doctor Doom attaining Wanda's reality altering powers. The new Doctor Doom teleports the team after Wanda begs him to relinquish the power. Doctor Doom appears in front of the X-Men, the Avengers, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the Young Avengers, and Wanda, and a battle ensues ending in Cassie's death. Wanda and Wiccan manage to drain the power from Doctor Doom, and he leaves. Iron Lad wants to take back Cassie's body into the timestream to find someone who could bring her back, but the [[Vision (Jonas)|Vision]] stops him and is subsequently destroyed. Wanda leaves to find herself, the X-Men go back to Utopia, and the Young Avengers decide to disband. Wiccan blames himself for everything that has happened, and ends up falling into a depression, but with Hulkling proposing to him the two get back into costume with Hawkeye and Speed (Patriot moved to Arizona) and Captain America makes the team full-fledged Avengers. In a one-shot issue of ''Children's Crusade: Young Avengers'', a flash to the future shows Billy wearing the uniform of Dr. Strange, implying he has attained the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme at some point in the future.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Allan Heinberg| penciller=Alan Davis| inker=Mark Farmer| title=Avengers: The Children's Crusade - Young Avengers (One-Shot)| issue=#1| date=March 16, 2011| publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| page=23| panel=2 }}.</ref>\n\n===Battle against Mother===\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | footer = The creators of volume 2: Kieron Gillen (left) and Jamie McKelvie (right)\n   | image1 = 10.16.11KieronGillenByLuigiNovi1.jpg\n   | width1 = 115\n   | image2 = 10.10.10JamieMcKelvieByLuigiNovi.jpg\n   | width2 = 150}}\nSome time later, it is revealed that the group went their separate ways due to their several losses. Billy and Teddy are living together with Billy's parents. Billy discovers though that Teddy has broken their promise to give up being superheroes by fighting crime at night. After getting into an argument, Billy tries to make it up to Teddy by shuffling through different realities to find one identical to theirs at the moment before Teddy's mother died. Billy finds this moment and brings Teddy's mother back to life. However, the Mother soon displays strange abilities and attempts to kill Billy and Teddy, with somehow Billy's parents not noticing. After escaping her, they run into [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], who due to recent events, is a child again. He tells them that the Mother is not actually Teddy's mom, but a parasite from the multiverse who takes the guise of whatever travelers are looking for. Due to its strange abilities, adults are oblivious to whatever happens around the Mother, and any parents around them become part of her personal army (save for Scarlet Witch, who is able to resist, but still remains oblivious to what is going on, as with the rest of the Avengers). The three soon reunite with Kate, who has been having one night stands with Noh-Varr, while joined by America Chavez, a god from another universe with super-strength and the ability to kick holes in reality. Discovering that any parents around the group fall prey to Mother's spell, the group uses Noh-Varr's ship to leave Earth, while Loki will train Billy in magic to hopefully reverse what he has done. On their travels, Loki talks to Teddy about Billy's powers, saying that it's highly unlikely that some attractive alien prince would just happen to find Billy, happen to be gay, and happen to fall in love with him. Teddy begins to wonder if he was indeed created by Billy to fill a hole in his life. Soon they are summoned back to Earth by former X-Men member [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|David Alleyne]], who has been working a temp job with Tommy. According to him, a mysterious figure wearing Patriot's old outfit kidnapped Tommy, and he requires their help to find him. Apparently, Tommy was brought to another reality, and America uses her powers to let them travel between worlds. The group hop from universe to universe for a while, eventually finding a universe of adorable creatures worshipping Billy as a god named 'the demiurge'. Loki and America have been trying to hide this from Billy for a while, but they reveal that one day he shall become an entity known as the demiurge, and during his time as this being, will change the laws of magic in every universe and every time period, past, present, and future. However, the group is soon ambushed by Mother while in between universes, and they become separated. When reuniting, Teddy tells Billy and what he and Loki discussed, and the two break up while on Earth. Teddy takes a break from the group, soon finding a support group for those wronged by the Young Avengers, apparently led by Mother. Mother kidnaps Teddy, and the Young Avengers prepare to save him. Loki develops a plan to have Billy access a fraction of the demiurge's power, which should be enough to kill Mother. Thinking they will be outnumbered by the armies Mother has been amassing made up of other-universe versions of the group and the parents she has brainwashed, David calls every super-powered hero under the age of 23 to help them fight, while all the world's older heroes and villains remain unaware that any of this is happening. Loki, however, tells Billy that Loki can only help if he is at full power, and Billy uses a spell to restore Loki to a young adult. Loki and Billy prepare to give Billy near-unlimited power while the battle in central park begins between Mother's army and the world's teenage and young adult heroes. Kate, America, Noh-Varr, and David save Teddy, Teddy finding Billy on the battlefield, who is unable to access his power. Teddy tells him it is okay, and the two kiss, this being the spark Billy needed to access the demiurge. Billy uses his moment of power to successfully kill Mother, getting rid of her spell and any trace of her through the multiverse. Billy reunites with his parents, introducing them to the group, though Loki has vanished. Later, a party is being held at a club by a mysterious benefactor, which the group and all the heroes who fought in the battle attend. Here, Billy and Teddy are shown to be once again in a happy relationship. The Young Avengers soon get ready to leave, save for Loki, who was watching from a distance, and was the benefactor for the party. The group leaves, as Loki reminisces while looking at a [[selfie]] they all took during their journeys together.<ref>Young Avengers Vol. 2 #1\u201315. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===New Avengers===\nLoki and America's prophecy comes true soon after Billy and Teddy are recruited by [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] to become members of the [[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]], a team working alongside [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]. A group of Kree-Skull hybrids arrive on Earth, intending for Teddy to finally ascend to his position as the Emperor who will unite the two warring races. Unable to stop their teleportation ray, Billy goes with him to their planet whilst the rest of the team attempt a rescue. Upon reaching the planet, they discover that one of the hybrids has been taken over by a ghost wizard named Moridun. He is killed by Teddy who resolves to return and take his place as Emperor when he is ready. Unbeknownst to the New Avengers, Moridun was not destroyed and has actually taken over Billy, who changes his codename to Demiurge. Under the control of Moridun, Billy begins acting weird, suggesting that they should kill some of the thieves they are fighting. It is only when a group of future avengers travel back in time to warn them does Teddy realise what has happened. Despite the future avengers preparing to kill Billy, Teddy encourages him to fight and he successfully drives Moridun out of his body, averting the huge amount of death that was to be caused. Later, Sunspot goes rogue, separating A.I.M. from the New Avengers and abandoning the team.\n\nDuring the [[Civil War II|second superhero civil war]], Wiccan joins forces with several other sorcerers lead by [[Doctor Strange]] to destroy a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. Although initially doubtful of his right to fight alongside such powerful magic users, his confidence is restored by Scarlet Witch. He is contacted by Sunspot, who convinces Billy, Teddy and Squirrel Girl to reform the New Avengers and work alongside A.I.M for one final mission. Wiccan teleports the trio onto a SHIELD helicarrier to aid in the rescue of [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] before regrouping with Sunspot and facing off against the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] and his [[Revengers]]. After this, the New Avengers permanently disband and, as a thank you, Sunspot gifts Wiccan and Hulkling an apartment overlooking Central Park, allowing the couple to focus on their personal lives for the time being.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4 #18.

Loki tries to gain Billy's forgiveness for attempting to manipulate him and steal the power of the demiurge when they both served as Young Avengers but he refuses, telling him it is not his place as he was not the only one wronged. While fighting Malekith's forces, Billy and Teddy see Loki's murder at the hands of [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]] and silently embrace.<ref>''War of the Realms: War Scrolls #2''.

He is taken into custody with the others and is greeted by [[Blade (character)|Blade]], who explains that the group were taken over by mysterious shapeshifters and framed for their actions. Angela quickly identifies these shapeshifters as Asgardian and the team track them to their base. Wiccan is reluctant to join the mission, believing that they are doing the wrong thing by keeping the Avengers in the dark about their mission but he is convinced that it is best if only a small group of people know about the shapeshifters as their power comes from people having knowledge of them. The group is attacked by [[Daimon Hellstrom]] and, assuming he is a shapeshifter in disguise, Blade kills him before receiving a phone call from [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]] who explains that her brother is with her in Las Vegas and is acting strangely. The team go to Satana's club and Wiccan is tasked with destroying the shapeshifter but stresses that his powers don't allow him to resurrect Hellstrom. Destroying the shapeshifter causes it to burst into a swarm of smaller creatures who capture Wiccan, take his form and send the fake Wiccan to meet with Hulking.<ref>''Strikeforce'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref> The shapeshifters keep the real Wiccan in a cell where they reveal that they have also captured Doctor Doom and command Wiccan to use his powers to gain Doom's secrets. Due to his history with Doom, Wiccan is apprehensive but quickly learns that they have captured a [[Doombot]] and have no idea that it is not the real Doctor Doom. Wiccan animates the Doombot and uses it to escape. The team retreat to a safehouse where Wiccan confronts the newly-resurrected Daimon Hellstrom about why he was working with the shapeshifters.<ref>''Strikeforce'' #4-5.

While patterning himself after Thor in the guise of Asgardian, Billy limited himself entirely to flight and lightning-based spells. By stating an intent and focusing on the outcome, Wiccan is capable of a variety of feats, including, but not limited to tracking and locating others, illusionary disguises, tearing down force-fields, mass teleportation, concussive blasts, enchantments, astral projection, and telekinetic force beams.\n\nBilly must be able to hear his spells for them to be successful, but some of Billy's spells can be activated without words. He has consistently been able to create force fields, teleport others, and generate lightning and force blasts with little or no effort.\n\nWiccan was one of the many possible candidates for the title of Sorcerer Supreme,<ref name=\"NA 51\" /><ref name=\"NA 52\" /> and has been described by the Vision as \"one of the most powerful mages on the planet.\"<ref name=\"NA 21\" /> Doctor Strange has partnered with a time-traveling Wiccan from the future and was confirmed that he succeeds Strange being the Sorcerer Supreme. Loki predicted that Wiccan will evolve into a god by his own right one day.\n\nIn Young Avengers vol. 2, it is revealed by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] that Wiccan is destined to ascend to a god-like reality warper who will rewrite the rules of magic known as the Demiurge.<ref>{{cite comic| writer=Kieron Gillen| penciller=Jamie McKelvie| inker=Matthew Wilson| title=Young Avengers| volume=2| issue=#9| date=August 28, 2013| publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| page=18| panel=5-6 }}.

While Kaplan believes himself and Shepherd may be Wanda Maximoff's reincarnated children, Shepherd is more skeptical about the situation.\n\nDuring their search for the Scarlet Witch, Wiccan is even more certain that he and Tommy are siblings.  Both boys refer to one another as \"brothers\" and Speed claims to be the older of the two (though neither knows for certain) and also refer to the Scarlet Witch as \"Mom\" while searching for her.\n\nIn ''Children's Crusade'' #6, Scarlet Witch confirms that Billy and Tommy are the genetic reincarnations of her sons.\n\nWhen Wanda is discussing her life with a psychiatrist, she again confirms that Billy and Tommy are the reincarnated souls of her sons. However, seeing as they are already teenagers, Wanda doesn't know if they were normal kids before her sons' souls took over their bodies (effectively killing whoever they were before) or whether the spirits went back in time to be born and raised by different parents.<ref>''Scarlet Witch'' vol. 2 #8</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\nExchanges between Wiccan and [[Hulkling]] had led to speculation that the two teens had a much more intimate bond than mere friendship.<ref name=\"10 Great LGBT Superheroes\">Alan Kistler (20 November 2013).

Teddy is able to bring Billy back \"out of the dark\" by proposing to him.\n\nIn Young Avengers Vol. 2, Billy and Teddy's relationship is tested due to the meddling of Loki, who plants the idea in Teddy's head that he is not real and was unknowingly created by Billy using his reality warping powers. Teddy is kissed by Prodigy. The couple reconcile at the conclusion of the storyline and are last seen happily dancing together at Marvel Boy's party.\n\nIn ''New Avengers'', the hybrids refer to Teddy as Emperor Dorrek VIII and Billy as his \"prince consort\".

As the Grim Reaper, Billy wielded a scythe of unknown nature, either technological or mystic, that could teleport back to him if it left his hand.
