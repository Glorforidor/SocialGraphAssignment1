As a young man in the Japanese military, Ichir\u014d's life was saved by Logan during the United States' [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]] and even offered his personal sword as gratitude. As an old man dying of cancer, Yashida arranged to be visited by Logan before seemingly passing with a family suit of samurai armor (referred to as the ''Silver Samurai'') at his funeral as a symbolic guardian. Unfortunately, his successor being Mariko instead of Shingen leads to his son's own plans. In actuality, Yashida faked his death and equipped himself into his own giant robotic [[adamantium]] Silver Samurai suit which wields a [[katana]] and a [[wakazashi|wakizashi]] (both of which are adamantium and can generate heat) with [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Dr. Green]] and [[Kenuichio Harada]] as enforcers. Obsessed with Wolverine's healing factor and immortality, Yashida devised his Silver Samurai armor not only to sustain himself but also to steal Wolverine's healing powers. Even eliminating Harada in his way, he uses his heated adamantium blades to sever Wolverine's adamantium claws which allowed him to extract Wolverine's healing factor via his Silver Samurai armor and regains his youthful form. However, Ichir\u014d gets struck by his granddaughter with Wolverine's broken adamantium claws. As Ichir\u014d loses control of his Silver Samurai armor, Wolverine's regrown bone claws impales Yashida through his chest which made him revert to his elderly form before tossing him to his death in a crevasse below.\n\n===Video games===\n* The Kenuichio Harada iteration of Silver Samurai was a [[player character|playable character]] in ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]'' and ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom 2]]'', voiced by Yasushi \"Ike-Bomb\" Ikeda.{{cn|date=May 2019}} \n* The Kenuichio Harada iteration of Silver Samurai appears in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'', voiced by [[Keone Young]].<ref name=\"btva\">{{cite web|title=Silver Samurai Voice - X-Men franchise <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors|url=https://behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/X-Men/Silver-Samurai/|website=behindthevoiceactors.com|date=December 19, 2019|postscript=.
