Art by George P\u00e9rez.|left|thumb]]\nWhen a Godwave spilled forth from the creation of the [[Jack Kirby&#39;s Fourth World|Fourth World]], the Earth was seeded with great power. It first manifested in the form of old gods, then of metahumans. Some of the oldest of these gods were hidden from the universe until the time of ancient Greece by the sorceress, [[Hecate]]. Hecate reasoned that the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Gods]] (as they would eventually be called) were greatly weakened after usurping power from their father [[Cronus]] and the [[Titans of Myth (comics)|Titans of Myth]]. She feared that other powerful gods in the universe (notably [[Darkseid]] of [[Apokolips]]) would seize Earth for himself. Because of Hecate&#39;s enchantment, Darkseid wrongly believed that he and the other [[New Gods]] pre-dated the Olympians.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #600&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #19&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nOne day, the young Uxas of [[Apokolips]] came to Rome. There he spread tales of the great Olympian gods. Their following grew tremendously in Rome and so they created avatars of themselves; they were worshipped under different names. Uxas knew that each half of the pantheon would be less powerful than the original gods. Later as the alien dark and demon god Darkseid, Uxas would use this knowledge to crush Zeus himself.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #132\u2013133&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nCenturies ago, an argument between [[Aphrodite (DC Comics)|Aphrodite]] and [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] led to the creation of the Amazons, who have been guided and protected by the goddesses ever since. Ares&#39; recent schemes to destroy the Amazons and his fellow gods led to an Amazon champion being chosen.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt; This champion was the Princess Diana, daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], whom Hermes escorted to Man&#39;s World. There she was called Wonder Woman. [[Hephaestus (DC Comics)|Hephaestus]] forged [[Wonder Woman]]&#39;s golden [[Lasso of Truth]] from the [[Golden Girdle of Gaea|girdle]] of the earth-goddess [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]], and her silver bracelets which he formed from the splintered Aegis of Zeus. While the Olympian gods were her patrons, other gods were her foes. Ares and his progeny, [[Children of Ares#Deimos|Deimos]] and [[Children of Ares#Phobos|Phobos]], quickly set about challenging the princess in her quest. Phobos created the creature [[Decay (DC Comics)|Decay]] from the \&quot;heart of the [[Gorgon]]\&quot;, which Diana quickly dispatched. Meanwhile, Deimos recruited humans on opposing sides, inciting them to war.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #3\u20134&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAres&#39; daughter, [[Children of Ares#Harmonia|Harmonia]], chose to help Diana, however. She gave her a powerful amulet with the power to transport across dimensions. Diana slew Deimos with her razor sharp tiara, and from him acquired the other half of Harmonia&#39;s amulet. Finally, Ares stepped in to claim the talisman, but Diana bound him with her lasso of truth. He realized that to allow humans to war would leave no kingdom for him to rule. In failure, Ares declared that he would no longer trifle with the affairs of man, and also forbade his offspring from appearing on Earth. He also took the amulet and all the power which had been collected therein.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #5\u20136&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn defeating Ares, Diana was greatly injured. The gods were so pleased with her that they took her into the sea and healed her. Then, [[Hermes (DC Comics)|Hermes]] gave her winged sandals which would enable her to travel freely between [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] and Man&#39;s World.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #7&lt;/ref&gt; At some point, the god Pan was killed and replaced by a [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunter]] android. It was this impostor who began a feud among the gods. The feud began when Zeus turned an amorous eye towards Diana, offering to make her a goddess if she participated in &#39;the ultimate sharing of the flesh&#39;. When Diana and her mother opposed the great god, he was angered and punished Diana. She would have to complete a task for each of the gods, culminating in the defeat of the monsters beyond \&quot;Doom&#39;s Doorway\&quot;. This doorway was the Amazon&#39;s charge for millennia and if Diana was unsuccessful, the Amazons would be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #10&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDiana succeeded in her trials, defeating numerous monsters including [[Echidna]], the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], the [[Cyclops]], the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], the [[Harpy|Harpies]], and the [[Minotaur]]. Eventually, Pan&#39;s bones were discovered on Olympus but it was too late to save Diana from her labors. Joined by her mother, Diana did indeed destroy the demons beneath Themyscira with the help of the amulet of Harmonia (these demons were funneled into Ares). Diana also freed [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Heracles]], who had borne the weight of Themyscira for eons while imprisoned in a stone form and had been scarred by various monsters. Heracles was accepted into [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #11\u201314&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSoon thereafter, the gods secreted themselves away for a conference. At this time, Darkseid attacked Olympus. The dark god ceased hostilities, though, as soon as he realized the place was deserted.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39; #600&lt;/ref&gt; When the gods returned, they had decided upon destroying Mount Olympus and undertaking a \&quot;cosmic migration\&quot; to the stars. Over Hermes&#39; objections, they took several steps. First, the three elder brothers made a new pact to replace the original pact which divided Earth among them. Then, they combined the will of all the gods (minus Ares) and the strength of Amazon prayer, and used Diana&#39;s bracelets to amplify that power (the bracelets are all that remained of Zeus&#39; Aegis; this Aegis was made from the hide of Amalthea, the goat which reared him. Thus, the old home was demolished and New Olympus was created. In order to properly establish this new home, it was necessary for the Gods to sequester themselves indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #16\u201319, 21&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHermes defected from his brethren and would not join the migration. He had already involved himself in Man&#39;s World by stopping the evil Circe.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #19&lt;/ref&gt; Hermes elected to remain on Earth and joined Diana in her mission.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #23\u201324&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Wars of the Gods===\n{{Main|War of the Gods (comics)}}\nPhobos returned alongside his sister Eris in alliance with [[Circe (comics)|Circe]]. Circe had amassed great power by bringing gods of various pantheons together. Among them were the Roman gods, who challenged the Olympians for their domain. It took much strength for Zeus to summon Hermes and Diana to New Olympus, where the gods had been trapped. Earth&#39;s heroes were able to turn the tide against Circe, but three gods died: Circe killed Hermes; Harmonia was killed by her sister Eris; and Eris herself was slain by [[Son of Vulcan]]. Zeus and the Olympians decided then to follow the call of Cronus and the Titans to help guide other worlds in the universe. New Olympus was left to the Roman gods.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;War of the Gods&#39;&#39; #1\u20134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #58\u201360&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFor unexplained reasons, Heracles struck a deal with a mortal man, Harold Campion, whereby the two would exchange places (Earth for Olympus) Heracles used the mirror of Circe to conceal his identity and adventured under the name Champion.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #110\u2013112&lt;/ref&gt; He cast a love spell on Diana and accompanied her for a time, until Diana discovered his true identity.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #115\u2013117&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the Gods&#39; absence, the Amazons began to revert to clay. To justify the Olympians&#39; return to Earth, Zeus summoned Diana and several of her friends to testify before him. It was Hippolyta who tipped the scales, however. She played a secret card which greatly swayed them. In truth, she simply reminded Ares that before her reincarnation, Hippolyta had been Ares&#39; daughter, and thus Zeus&#39; granddaughter. At this time, Zeus also granted strength and flight to [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Cassie Sandsmark]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #122&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, [[Highfather]] of the New Gods summoned Zeus and Heracles to once gain battle Darkseid. To this end, Zeus, [[Odin]], Ares, [[Jove]] and Highfather merged into one being and entered the Source. When cast out, Zeus was gravely injured and remained bonded to Jove. Heracles returned with him to Olympus.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Jack Kirby&#39;s Fourth World&#39;&#39; #8&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTheir greatest champion, Princess Diana soon lost her life against the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #125&lt;/ref&gt; Hera (now presiding over Olympus) transfigured Diana into a goddess of truth and welcomed her to live with the gods. Diana was told she could not interfere with the daily lives of mortals, unless prayed to. Hera sits on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #127\u2013129&lt;/ref&gt; The gods shared the secret of their division with Diana and decided to reunite their essences with those of their Roman counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #130\u2013133&lt;/ref&gt; Diana could not be prevented from interfering with the mortal world and so she was banished to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #136&lt;/ref&gt; She was soon also stripped of her immortality.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #139&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe merger of the Greek and Roman pantheons did not sit well with the Roman goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. She accepted an offer of power from the old \&quot;Shattered God\&quot;, separated from Artemis and betrayed the Olympians. Diana died in battle with Wonder Woman when she was crushed by a statue of Zeus. The Olympians were incapacitated, but Wonder Woman eventually found a way to awaken them in time for them to strike decisively at the Shattered God.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #189\u2013194&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Merger of Pantheons===\n[[File:UnitedGoddesses.jpg|thumb|Goddesses (l to r): Mammitu, Demeter, Isis, Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite, Neith, Hestia and Bast]]\nWith the appearance of the [[Bana-Mighdall]]ian Amazons, the Olympians faced a new prospect. Though devout Amazons, these newest citizens of Themyscira do not worship the Greek gods. Renouncing them millennia ago, the tribe instead worship a combination of Egyptian and middle eastern deities. The central gods worshipped by the desert Amazons are: [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]] (wisdom and magic), [[Mamitu|Mammitu]] (judgement bringer), [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]] (nature and feminine), and [[Neith]] (mother figure and protection). These gods followed the Bana-Mighdallian Amazons to Themyscira where they continued to be worshipped. Facing the situation with hands tied, both pantheons agreed to integrate themselves with each other for the benefit of their people. Though these new gods do not reside on Olympus, they are treated with diplomacy when called to aid the Amazons in a united godly role. Despite the gods mentioned being part of the inner-circle of deities in the Bana&#39;s belief system, less significant gods have been shown to be part of their godly pantheon as well such as [[Sekhmet]] (war god), [[Thoth]] (their only known male god) and possibly [[Ishtar]] (love goddess). The gods of Bana-Mighdall proved their loyalty to the Olympians by aiding the Greek gods in battle when the war gods Sekhmet and Ares previously devised a coup on Olympus.\n\n===Revolution===\nFor millennia, the goddess Athena waited patiently for the chance to prove herself worthy of the crown of Olympus. As Earth society developed, the goddess of knowledge grew in power and cunning, and ultimately challenged her father Zeus for the throne. To win this challenge, Athena sent for her champion, Wonder Woman, to face that of Zeus \u2014 Briareos of the [[Hecatoncheires]]. Though she was still blind, Diana was aided by the winged [[Pegasus]] but seemingly fell to Briareos. Unknown to Zeus, this was a trick played by Athena and Diana to prove to the latter that Zeus had no compassion and was not a worthy ruler. Athena agreed to forfeit if Zeus would spare Diana&#39;s life, but he denied her, proving his unworthiness. This prompted the other goddesses to deliver the head of [[Medusa]] unto Diana, which she used to turn Briareos to stone. Athena took the throne at last, but Zeus immediately began plotting a coup with his brothers in [[Tartarus]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #212\u2013213&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAthena immediately set Diana on a quest into [[Hades (DC Comics)|Hades]]&#39; realm to free the god Hermes. She descended beneath Doom&#39;s Doorway with [[Wonder Girl]] (Cassandra Sandsmark) and Ferdinand the Minotaur and was confronted by Zeus&#39; alliance. Ironically, she might not have succeeded but for the machinations of her constant nemesis, Ares.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #215&lt;/ref&gt; Ares acted as a double agent and gained Zeus&#39; trust, but when the opportunity arose, he killed his uncle Hades and assumed control of the Underworld. Diana then used Hermes&#39; [[caduceus]] to revive him. Back on Olympus, Zeus asked for Athena&#39;s forgiveness, which she granted. Athena then also restored Diana&#39;s sight, but bound it to her own.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #216\u2013217&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIt was on this quest that Cassandra Sandsmark finally learned of her own godly origins. Her mother had indeed lain with Zeus, but Helena Sandsmark forbade Diana or anyone from revealing the truth to Cassie.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #217&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nNot long after this, Athena sensed a dark destiny for the gods amidst the cosmic mechanations of [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]]. In the crisis created by his chaos, Diana was forced to kill [[Maxwell Lord]], and incurred the ire of the world&#39;s public.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #219&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government responded by mobilizing against Themyscira, and Diana realized that as long as she was a target, the Amazons would never be safe. Diana prayed to the gods to take the Amazons to safety, but got more than she bargained for.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #224&lt;/ref&gt; On Olympus, she pleaded against Athena&#39;s decision to remove the gods from Earth&#39;s affairs. Regardless, the gods departed, leaving Diana bereft of family and faith.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; #225&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Aquaman]] has also had run-ins with the Olympian sea deities. Poseidon had long relinquished the title of Sea King to Orin of Atlantis, but when Aquaman&#39;s subjects lost faith in him, Poseidon arranged a challenge with his son [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Aquaman&#39;&#39; vol. 5 #34&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaman bested Triton and the godling fell from grace with his father. In anger, Triton slayed Poseidon and claimed his power.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Aquaman&#39;&#39; #42&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaman freed Poseidon by appealing to Lord Hades. When they returned from the dead, Poseidon slew his son in turn.
