Fury and his Howling Commandos&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; was a comic book series created by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Stan Lee]] and published by Marvel Comics from 1963 to 1981. The main character, Sgt. [[Nick Fury]], later became the leader of Marvel&#39;s super-spy agency, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The title also featured the [[Howling Commandos]], a [[character (arts)|fictional]] [[World War II]] unit that [[first appearance|first appeared]] in &#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&#39;&#39; #1 ([[cover date]]d May 1963).\n\n==Publication history==\nStan Lee has described the series &#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&#39;&#39; as having come about due to a bet with his publisher, [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] that the Lee-Kirby style could make a book sell even with the worst title Lee could devise.&lt;ref&gt;Ro, Ronin. &#39;&#39;Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution&#39;&#39; (Bloomsbury USA, 2005 reissue {{ISBN|1-58234-566-X}}), p. 78:\n{{blockquote|To this day, Stan claims that [the replacement for the canceled title &#39;&#39;[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]&#39;&#39;] was the result of a bet between him and Goodman. As Stan tells, Goodman told him their books were selling because of buzzwords like &#39;&#39;Amazing&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Fantastic&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Mighty&#39;&#39;, and &#39;&#39;Incredible&#39;&#39;. Stan answered that the Lee-Kirby style was responsible ... and offered the following challenge: \&quot;I&#39;ll do a war book with the worst title I can come up with, but if it&#39;s done in the Marvel style, I bet it&#39;ll sell.\&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee elaborated on that claim in a 2007 interview, responding to the suggestion that the series title did not necessarily seem bad:\n{{blockquote|It did at the time. First of all, it was too long for a title &amp;mdash; we didn&#39;t have any that were six words. And \&quot;Howling\&quot; was a long word, and \&quot;Commandos\&quot; was a long word. I got the name \&quot;Howling Commandos\&quot; because in the Army there was a group called the [[101st Airborne Division|Screaming Eagles]]. And I loved the sound of that. So I figured we&#39;d have the Howling Commandos.&lt;ref&gt;Archive of [https://www.webcitation.org/5unr2TLup?url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/fast-chat-stan-lee-1.620730 \&quot;Fast Chat: Stan Lee\&quot;]. &#39;&#39;[[Newsday]]&#39;&#39;, April 1, 2007. Online version March 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Comics-artist contemporary [[John Severin]] recalled in an interview conducted in the early 2000s that in the late 1950s, Kirby had approached him to be partners on a [[print syndication|syndicated]], [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] \&quot;set in Europe during World War Two; the hero would be a tough, cigar-chomping sergeant with a squad of oddball GIs &amp;mdash; sort of an adult &#39;&#39;[[Boy Commandos]]&#39;&#39;\&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Ro, pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; referring to a 1940s wartime \&quot;kid gang\&quot; comics series Kirby had co-created for [[DC Comics]].\n\n&#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&#39;&#39; followed an elite special unit, the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the \&quot;Howling Commandos\&quot;, which was stationed in a military base in [[England]] to fight missions primarily, but not exclusively, in the [[European theatre of World War II]].&lt;!--Howlers fought in Okinawa and elsewhere; Izzy was imprisoned for several issues as a POW in Japan--&gt; Under Captain \&quot;Happy Sam\&quot; Sawyer, Fury was the cigar-chomping [[non-commissioned officer|noncom]] who led the racially and ethnically integrated unit (racial integration was unusual for the then-segregated U.S. military, though possible in elite special forces units).&lt;ref&gt;Lovece, &#39;&#39;Nimbus&#39;&#39; #3, p. 4: \&quot;[T]he book was unlike most group comics in that the cast were not all [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]], but instead, a superb melting pot of various religions, races, colors, and creeds, an incredible challenge to do [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistically]] yet inoffensively.\&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was obliged to send a memo to the color separator at the printing plant to confirm that the character [[Gabe Jones]] was [[African American]], after the character had appeared with [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] coloring in the first issue.&lt;ref name=markalexander /&gt;\n\nThe series ran 167 issues (May 1963 - Dec. 1981), though with reprints alternating with new stories from issue #80 (Sept. 1970), and only in reprints after issue #120 (July 1974); at this point the formal [[copyright]]ed title in the [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]], which had been simply &#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury&#39;&#39;, was changed to match the [[trademark]]ed cover logo, &#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=gcd-sgtfury&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/7233/ &#39;&#39;Sgt.

Fury and his Howling Commandos&#39;&#39;] (issues #121-167) at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; Following seven issues by creators Lee and Kirby (who returned to collaborate on #13 and on the opening and closing pages of #18),&lt;ref name=gcd-sgtfury /&gt; [[penciller]] [[Dick Ayers]] began his long stint on what would be his signature series, penciling 95 issues, including two extra-length [[annual publication|annuals]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovece, &#39;&#39;Nimbus&#39;&#39; #3, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Severin]] later joined as inker, forming a long-running, award-winning team; he would, additionally, both pencil and ink issues #44-46. The series&#39; only other pencilers came on one issue each by [[Tom Sutton]] (which Ayers said was \&quot;done that time I asked for a furlough and reassignment\&quot;)&lt;ref name=ayersnimbusp9&gt;Ayers in Lovece, &#39;&#39;Nimbus&#39;&#39; #3, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herb Trimpe]] (\&quot;They shuffled Trimpe and me around, [him] to &#39;&#39;Fury&#39;&#39; and [me] and Severin to &#39;&#39;[[Hulk|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;The Incredible&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Hulk]]&#39;&#39;\&quot; Ayers recalled.)&lt;ref name=ayersnimbusp9 /&gt;\n\n[[Roy Thomas]] followed Lee as writer, himself followed by [[Gary Friedrich]], for whom this also became a signature series.&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/1575/ &#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ayers said in 1977, \&quot;Stan Lee left &#39;&#39;Fury&#39;&#39; first to Roy Thomas because the [[superhero]]es were gaining in popularity at that time it was best he concentrate on them\&quot;, referring to the young Marvel&#39;s then growing line of superhero comics, such as &#39;&#39;[[Fantastic Four]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39;. \&quot;I must admit I resented somewhat those superheroes taking Stan away from &#39;&#39;Fury&#39;&#39;!&lt;ref name=ayersnimbus&gt;Ayers in Lovece, &#39;&#39;Nimbus&#39;&#39; #3, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFriedrich began as a co-scripter of issues #42-44 (May\u2013July 1967). The Friedrich-Ayers-Severin team began in earnest, however, with #45 (Aug. 1967), the first of what would be several of the series&#39; \&quot;The\&quot; stories: \&quot;The War Lover\&quot;, a shaded exploration of a trigger-happy soldier and the line drawn, even in war, between killing and murder. Daring for the time, when majority public sentiment still supported the undeclared [[Vietnam War]], the story balanced present-day issues while demonstrating that even in what is referred to as \&quot;a [[just war theory|just war]]\&quot;, a larger [[morality]] prevails. As one writer in the 1970s observed,\n\n{{blockquote|...&#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury&#39;&#39; #45 took a firm moralistic stance for the rest of the series by premiering what would become one of the most acclaimed series of stories in comics: the Gary Friedich \&quot;The\&quot; series, beginning with \&quot;The War Lover\&quot;. ... Future stories in that fashion \u2014 all but one written by Friedrich \u2014 would center on what war could do to \&quot;The Assassin\&quot; (#51), the tragedy of a man turned hired liquidator, his family held hostage by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]&#39;s [[Gestapo]]; \&quot;The Informer\&quot; (#57), an observation on loyalty and trust, staged in a German [[prisoner of war|P.O.W.]] camp; \&quot;The Peacemonger\&quot; (#64) [about a World War II [[conscientious objector]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;; \&quot;The Deserter\&quot; (#75), an allusion to the real-life execution of Private [[Eddie Slovik]]; \&quot;The All-American\&quot; (#81), [[Al Kurzrok]]&#39;s tale of a man [caught] between the twin microcosms of sport and war; and ultimately, \&quot;The Reporter\&quot; (#110), an account of a [[journalist]] faced with the [question of] when might a human life be forfeit? Many feel, also, that #46&#39;s tale, \&quot;They Also Serve\&quot;, should be included ... for that story might as easily have been called \&quot;The Medic\&quot;....&lt;ref&gt;Lovece, &#39;&#39;Nimbus&#39;&#39; #3 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\n[[Image:SgtFury57.jpg|thumb|left|&#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury&#39;&#39; #57 (Aug. 1968), featuring a Friedrich \&quot;The\&quot; story. Cover art by [[Dick Ayers]] &amp; [[John Severin]].]]\nAt his best, Ayers&#39; art in &#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury&#39;&#39; showed \&quot;a clear, forthright storyteller, excellent in medium close shots with a subtly out-of-focus background. He blended large panels with thin or small ones for movement, and often provided vast, [[CinemaScope|cinemascopic]] panoramas for his writers to work with.... [E]ven in a scene that would ordinarily be static you could feel his characters breathing.\&quot;&lt;ref name=nimbus3p7&gt;Lovece, &#39;&#39;Nimbus&#39;&#39; #3, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Inker Severin \&quot;took the art even further, laying dark, scratchy inks\&quot; that gave grit to Ayers&#39; pencils.&lt;ref name=nimbus3p7 /&gt; Ayers himself \&quot;liked the results of John Severin&#39;s work on &#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury&#39;&#39; immensely\&quot;, he said in 1977. \&quot;He added details beyond what I&#39;d put in. He always seemed to go one step beyond.\&quot;&lt;ref name=ayersnimbus /&gt;\n\nFriedrich continued through #83 (Jan. 1971), with the late part of this run having reprint issues alternating with new stories. He returned for the even-numbered issues from #94-114 (Jan. 1972 - Nov. 1973).&lt;ref name=gcd-sgtfury /&gt;\n\n&#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury&#39;&#39; ran concurrently with two other, short-lived Marvel World War II series, &#39;&#39;[[Captain Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders|Capt.&lt;!--sp abbreviated OK--&gt; Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders]]&#39;&#39; (later titled &#39;&#39;Captain&lt;!--spelled fully OK--&gt; Savage and his Battlefield Raiders&#39;&#39;), which lasted 19 issues from 1968\u20131970; and &#39;&#39;[[Combat Kelly and the Deadly Dozen]]&#39;&#39;, which lasted nine issues from 1972-1973. The Howlers guest starred in #6 and #11 of the former series, and #4 of the latter.\n\nLee explained the series&#39;s transition to reprints: \&quot;... so much fan mail came in from readers who wanted more of &#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury&#39;&#39;, but we didn&#39;t have time, I didn&#39;t have the men to draw it, I didn&#39;t have the time to write it, and we were busy with other things, so we just started re-printing the books, and strangely enough, the reprint versions of &#39;&#39;Sgt.

The final three contain reprints only, save for a 10-page framing sequence in #6. In annuals #1 and #3, the Howlers reunited for a special mission each in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]], respectively; annual #2 found them storming the beaches at [[Normandy]] on [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] in 1944, and annual #4 was a flashback to the [[Battle of the Bulge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/1687/ &#39;&#39;Sgt.

Suddenly, with the death of &#39;Junior&#39; Juniper, the series acquired some real cachet. It now played like a true-life war drama where people got killed and never came back.

His first appearance was in &#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos vol. 1 #1&#39;&#39; (May 1963).\n\n====Fictional character biography====\nCohen is one of the many allies of [[Nick Fury]] who work together in battling the Nazi menace throughout World War 2. Cohen has had dozens of adventures with the team, such as in &#39;&#39;Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos #32&#39;&#39;, where he comes under the influence of Nazi brainwashing. He manages to resist the commands to kill his friends and is able to help turn the tables on his brainwasher and complete the interrupted mission to destroy a weapons plant. During his adventures, his sister, unnamed, is briefly seen.{{issue|date=February 2017}}\n\nAfter the war, Cohen goes back to Brooklyn, settles down with his wife and runs his father&#39;s mechanic shop. He has two sons and one daughter. He turns the family business into a string of car dealerships, which he eventually passes down to his sons.{{issue|date=February 2017}}\n\nCohen signs up for a tour of duty in the Korean War, where he makes the rank of sergeant.{{issue|date=February 2017}}\n\nCohen&#39;s military career continues to the Vietnam war, where he reunites with the Commandos for a special mission. Outside of the war, Cohen still ends up in trouble. In a 1972 reunion he ends up shot and a decade later, he confronts a [[Life Model Decoy]] of the Nazi war criminal [[Baron von Strucker]].{{issue|date=February 2017}}\n\nWhen Nick Fury&#39;s espionage organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] is corrupted by a sentient Life Model Decoy and nearly destroyed from within, Cohen serves with the group until it can get back on its feet.{{issue|date=February 2017}}\n\nOver the years Cohen and his friends have dealt with Nick Fury&#39;s deaths, mostly correctly guessing it was some sort of ruse or LMD. They were fooled in one instance where the vigilante [[Punisher]], not in his right mind, had slain a Fury LMD.{{issue|date=February 2017}}\n\n====Powers and abilities====\nCohen is considered a mechanical genius. Though he specializes in automobiles, he has a talent for rigging and fixing all sorts of mechanical devices. As a ranger, he is also trained in explosives. His weaponry tends to consist of grenades and machine guns.\n\n====In other media====\n* Izzy appears briefly in the &#39;&#39;[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]&#39;&#39; animated series from the 1990s, in the episode \&quot;Old Soldiers\&quot;,{{cn|date=February 2018}} along with two of his comrades of the Howling Commandos, Nick Fury and [[Dum Dum Dugan]], rescuing [[Captain America]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].\n* Cohen appears in &#39;&#39;[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Wrath of the Red Skull\&quot;.{{cn|date=February 2018}} He alongside Dum Dum Dugan and [[Gabe Jones]] were featured in a flashback when Nick Fury recounts how he and Captain America fought the Red Skull.\n* Izzy Cohen appears in the 1998 live-action [[television film|TV movie]] &#39;&#39;[[Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Their death-defying stunts caught the attention of [[Lieutenant]] [[Happy Sam Sawyer|Samuel \&quot;Happy Sam\&quot; Sawyer]] when Fury and Hargrove were training British [[Commando]]s in low-level parachuting. Sawyer was serving with the British Commandos in 1940 and underwent training by Fury.&lt;ref name=markalexander /&gt; Sawyer enlisted them for a special mission in the [[Netherlands]]. Nick and Red later joined the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], with Fury undergoing basic training under a Sergeant Bass at [[Fort Dix]] in [[New Jersey]]. Both Fury and Red were stationed at [[Schofield Barracks]], [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]] when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] attacked the base on December 7, 1941, and Red was among the many killed in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;bass\&quot;&gt;This paragraph per &#39;&#39;Sgt.

Sawyer assigned Fury the command of the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the \&quot;Howling Commandos\&quot;.

Fury fell in love with an English [[nursing|nurse]], Pamela Hawley, who died in a bombing raid of London before he could propose to her.&lt;ref name=markalexander /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduced in #4 (Nov. 1963), died in #18 (May 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Howling Commandos&#39; earliest (but not first-published) assignment occurred in the autumn of 1942. They were to recover British [[aerospace engineering|rocket scientist]] Dr. MacMillan from a German military base in occupied [[Norway]]. Their success brought the attention of British [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], who incorporated the unit into the [[British Army]], and given the title of \&quot;Commandos\&quot;.\n\nThe Howlers fought against the likes of [[Germany|German]] General [[Erwin Rommel]] and inter-squad [[bigotry]], often in the same story. Antagonists included [[Baron Strucker]], [[Captain America]]&#39;s nemeses [[Baron Zemo]] and the [[Red Skull]] ([[Adolf Hitler]]&#39;s prot\u00e9g\u00e9), and other [[Axis powers|Axis]] villains. The Howlers encountered [[Office of Strategic Services]] agent Reed Richards (later [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]) in issue #3 (Sept. 1963), and fought alongside Captain America and [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky]] in #13 (Dec. 1964).\n\nThey reunited for missions in the [[Korean War]], where Fury received a field promotion to [[lieutenant]], and the [[Vietnam War]], each in a summer-[[annual publication|annual]] special, as well as at a present-day, fictional reunion gala in issue #100 (July 1972).\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n\n====Animation====\n* The Howling Commandos appear in a cameo of &#39;&#39;[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]&#39;&#39; animated series from the 1990s.
