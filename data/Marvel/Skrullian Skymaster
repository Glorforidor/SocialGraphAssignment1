The Skrulls first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]&#39;&#39; #2 and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. They originated from the planet Skrullos and their empire is located in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].\n\nThe Skrulls appeared in the 2019 films &#39;&#39;[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]&#39;&#39; with their leader [[Talos the Untamed|Talos]] portrayed by [[Ben Mendelsohn]] and his wife Soren by [[Sharon Blynn]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=January 2019}}\nThe Skrulls first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]&#39;&#39; #2 and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;IGNretrospective\&quot; /&gt; The Skrulls next appear in &#39;&#39;Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; #18. The four who impersonated the members of the [[Fantastic Four]] next appear in &#39;&#39;[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]&#39;&#39; #92. The concept of the Skrulls would be explored and used throughout multiple storylines, spin-off comics, and derivative projects.\n\n==Fictional species biography==\n\nMillions of years ago, in the main Marvel continuity,  the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] perform genetic experiments on the [[reptile|reptilian]] ancestors of the Skrulls, resulting in three branches of Skrulls: The &#39;&#39;&#39;Prime&#39;&#39;&#39;, the &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]&#39;&#39;&#39; and the &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]&#39;&#39;&#39;. Eventually the three branches battle with one another, and the Deviant branch \u2013 due to possessing the innate ability to [[shapeshift]] \u2013 were triumphant, and wiped out all members of the other two races until only two were left: the Skrull Eternal, [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kly&#39;bn|Kly&#39;bn]], and Prime Skrull of the original non-Deviant Skrull race. Kly&#39;bn implored them to spare his life, as killing him would kill part of their heritage. The Deviants&#39; leader, Sl&#39;gur&#39;t, eventually fell in love with Kly&#39;bn, with the two eventually becoming the [[Gods (Marvel Comics)|gods]] of the Skrull pantheon.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Incredible Hercules&#39; 2008\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Greg Pak]] and [[Fred van Lente]]|penciller=Rafa Sandoval|inker=Roger Bonet and Greg Adams|colorist=Marte Gracia, Dennis Calero and Raul Trevino|letterer=Joe Caramagna|editor=Mark Paniccia|story=Secret Invasion|title=Incredible Hercules|volume=1|issue=#120|date=August 2008|publisher=Marvel Comics||location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the name Prime Skrull, the last original Skrull escaped to Earth in the 20th century and later became a member of the [[Underground Legion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Glenn Herdling]]|penciller=[[Angel Medina (artist)|Angel Medina]]|inker=Bill Anderson|colorist=Ray Murtaugh|letterer=Jack Morelli|title=Blackwulf|volume=1|issue=#2|date=July 1994|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that point, the Skrulls began to expand their territory. The Deviant branch later split into two more groups, the modern Skrulls and an anomaly called the [[Dire Wraith]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Bill Mantlo]]|penciller=[[Sal Buscema]]|inker=Ian Akin and Brian Garvey|colorist=Ben Sean|letterer=Janice Chiang|editor=Bob Haras|story=Assistant Editor&#39;s Month 1984|title=Rom|volume=1|issue=#50|date=January 1984|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Skrulls originate from the planet of Skrullos, and were originally a mercantile civilization, primarily interested in [[free trade]] and willing to share their [[technology]] with all races they deemed worthy. When they encountered a new race, they simply transformed themselves to resemble that race. The Skrull empire that resulted from these contacts was based on free trade and mutual cooperation.\n\n===Kree\u2013Skrull War===\n{{main|Kree\u2013Skrull War}}\nEventually, the Skrulls developed long-distance space travel; a great tour of the universe was undertaken, led by Emperor Dorrek. Finally, the Skrull delegation reached the planet Hala, home to the then-barbaric [[Kree]] and the peaceful [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]], and held a contest to determine which of the races would represent Hala to the Skrull Empire. Seventeen members of each race were taken to different uninhabited planetoids where they were left with sufficient supplies for one year. At the end of that period, whichever group had done the most with themselves would be adjudged the most worthy. The Kree were taken to Earth&#39;s [[Blue Area of the Moon|Moon]] where they built a great city while the Cotati were taken to another barren world in a different solar system and used their abilities to create a beautiful park. Realizing that the Cotati were going to win, the enraged Kree killed all the Cotati. When the Kree revealed that they had solved the question of who would represent Hala to the Skrulls by destroying their opposition, the Skrull delegates were appalled and vowed that Hala would forever be banned from their circle of favored worlds\u2014so the Kree massacred them as well, took over the Skrull landing spaceship by force, and developed their own technology from it.\n\nBecause of the immense distances involved, decades passed before the Skrulls learned of the Kree&#39;s activities. By this time it was too late. The Kree were now advanced and audacious enough to attack the Skrulls in their home galaxy. During the millennia that followed, the Kree aggression forced the Skrulls to become a militaristic civilization, and the Skrulls eventually developed the vicious streak needed to conduct intergalactic war. Their entire culture was remade in the warrior image. The [[Kree\u2013Skrull War]] continued for thousands of years with only brief interruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Steve Englehart]]|penciller=Sal Buscema|inker=Joe Staton|colorist=Phil Rachelson|letterer=Tom Orzechowski|title=Avengers|volume=1|issue=#133 \u2013 134|date=March \u2013 April 1975|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Skrull Throneworld is later moved from Skrullos to the more central Tarnax IV, with their empire encompassing over fifty worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Scott Edelman]]|penciller=[[Al Milgrom]]|inker=Terry Austin|colorist=Irene Vartanoff|letterer=Joe Rosen and Gaspar Saladino|editor=[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]]|title=Captain Marvel|volume=1|issue=#51|date=July 1977|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Skrulls also created the first [[Cosmic Cube]], which later became the [[Shaper of Worlds]]; the Shaper related that, upon attaining self-awareness, he lashed out blindly, destroying two thirds of the Skrull empire and casting the civilization back into barbarism (suggesting this occurred before the war with the Kree broke out).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Peter Gillis]]|penciller=Brian Postman|inker=Kim DeMulder|colorist=Bob Sharen|letterer=Diana Albers|editor=Mark Gruenwald|title=Captain America Annual|issue=#7|date=October 1983|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Kree Accuser [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] had wrested control of the Kree Empire from the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and attacked the Skrulls, reigniting hostilities. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] become involved once the [[Super Skrull]] kidnaps [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]], and in turn they battle a Kree [[Sentry (Kree)|Sentry]] robot, three of the original Skrulls that had fought the Fantastic Four, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, rogue [[Inhumans]] and legions of Skrulls. The Supreme Intelligence ends the immediate conflict by revealing to Avengers&#39; ally [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] that he has vast mental potential, which is then used to freeze all combatants in place. The Supreme Intelligence announces that, while the Kree and Skrulls have reached genetic dead ends, the human race displays incredible untapped potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Roy Thomas]]|penciller=Sal Buscema|inker=Sam Grainger|letterer=Sam Rosen|editor=[[Stan Lee]]|story=Kree-Skrull War|title=Avengers|volume=1|issue=#89 \u2013 97|date=June 1971 \u2013 March 1972|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed years later that the conflict produced a Kree-Skrull hybrid, [[Hulkling]], who is the child of one-time lovers Captain Marvel and the Skrull Princess [[Anelle]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Young Avengers #9 \u2013 12 2005\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Allan Heinberg]]|penciller=[[Jim Cheung]]|inker=Dave Meikis, John Dell and Jim Cheung|colorist=Justin Ponsor|letterer=Cory Petit|editor=Tom Brevoort|title=Young Avengers|volume=1|issue=#9 \u2013 12|date=December 2005 \u2013 August 2006|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Empire changing events===\nThe Skrulls became aware of Earth when they discovered a space warp linking Earth and Throneworld. Later they discovered the Earth possesses an equidistant link to Hala. They see Earth as a world to conquer but they are content to hold off a full invasion. Because of their caution, the Skrulls have sent only a handful of scoutwarriors to infiltrate Earth, but fail to take into account the presence of the modern [[superhero]].\n\nIn 1958, Skrulls attempted to sabotage Earth&#39;s space program. They battled [[3-D Man]], and set the Cold Warrior against 3-D Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Roy Thomas|penciller=[[Jim Craig (comics)|Jim Craig]]|inker=Dave Hunt|colorist=George Roussos|letterer=John Costanza|title=Marvel Premiere|volume=1|issue=#35\u201337|date=April\u2013August 1977|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later a small scouting party used their shape shifting powers to impersonate the [[Fantastic Four]], committing crimes so the country would turn against the Fantastic Four, the only ones with the power to stop them. But the Fantastic Four were able to locate the Skrulls and tricked their leaders into believing the Earth was full of threats. The fleet left and Mr. Fantastic made the Skrulls that were left behind shapeshift into cows and he hypnotized them to remember nothing about their true heritage.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Fantastic Four #2 January 1962\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Stan Lee|penciller=[[Jack Kirby]]|inker=George Klain and Christopher Rule|title=Fantastic Four|volume=1|issue=#2|date=1 January 1962|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn retaliation the Skrull Emperor Dorrek VII dispatches Kl&#39;rt, a Skrull known as the [[Super-Skrull]], to Earth to defeat the Fantastic Four. Kl&#39;rt possesses the powers of the entire Fantastic Four (in addition to shapeshifting and [[hypnotism]]), and he holds the team at bay until Mister Fantastic discovers the source of his power and uses a miniature device to jam the ray, before the Human Torch imprisons him inside a crater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Stan Lee|penciller=Jack Kirby|inker=Dick Ayers|colorist=Stan Goldberg|letterer=Artie Simek|title=Fantastic Four|volume=1|issue=#18|date=September 1963|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Super-Skrull posed as the jailed Dr. [[Franklin Storm]], after transporting him to the Skrull throneworld, and battled the Fantastic Four as the Invincible Man, another Skrull, ultimately caused the death of Dr. Storm by attaching a bomb to his chest before he was transported back, although Storm turned to the floor, saving the Fantastic Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Stan Lee|penciller=Jack Kirby|inker=Chic Stone|letterer=Sam Rosen|title=Fantastic Four|volume=1|issue=#32|date=November 1964|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fantastic Four later travel to Tarnax IV and find the Skrull responsible for the murder of Susan and Johnny Storm&#39;s father (which turned out to be Warlord Morrat).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Stan Lee|penciller=Jack Kirby|inker=Chic Stone|letterer=Sam Rosen|title=Fantastic Four|volume=1|issue=#37|date=April 1965|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skrulls were involved in other events such as sending the Super-Skrull to battle [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Roy Thomas|penciller=[[Gene Colan]]|inker=Vince Colletta|letterer=Arti Simek|editor=Stan Lee|title=Captain Marvel|volume=1|issue=#2\u20133|date=June\u2013July 1968|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abducting the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] as a contestant in the Skrull Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Stan Lee|penciller=Jack Kirby|inker=Joe Sinnott|letterer=Sam Rosen|title=Fantastic Four|volume=1|issue=#89\u201393|date=August 1967 \u2013 April 1970|publisher=Marvel Comics||location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLater the cosmic being the [[Uatu|Watcher]] adjudicates a duel between champions from both races: Colonel Bel-Dann of the Kree and Warlord Raksor of the Skrulls.

Their galaxy is filled with Governors who have declared themselves to be Emperor of the Skrulls and soon a civil war began. The [[Shi&#39;ar]] maintain a heavy presence in the former empire as well, constantly dealing with packets of resistance.\n\n===Second Kree-Skrull War===\nLater Reed Richards discovered that yet another Governor-turned-Emperor, Zabyk, had created a genetics bomb, which, when it exploded made all the Skrulls lose their shape-shifting abilities. Whatever form they were in they were stuck in at the time of the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Roger Stern]]|penciller=John Byrne|inker=Kyle Baker|colorist=Christie Scheele|letterer=John Workman|editor=Mark Gruenwald|title=Avengers Annual|volume=1|issue=#14|date=30 July 1985|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}; \n{{Cite comic|writer=John Byrne|inker=Joe Sinnott|colorist=Glynis Wein|letterer=Jim Novak|editor=Michael Carlin|title=Fantastic Four Annual|volume=1|issue=#19|date=November 1985|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn desperation, since without their shapeshifting powers they were vulnerable, they managed to kidnap the herald of Galactus, Nova, in an attempt to get Galactus to destroy Kree worlds for them. Their plot failed when the [[Silver Surfer]] helped Galactus rescue Nova in exchange for his freedom from Earth.\n\nWhen the Celestials made an appearance, this scared the Skrulls into starting a second war with the Kree to show they were not powerless. The attack was first made by Kylor, one of five governors claiming to be Emperor. He had a spy in the Kree Empire, Nenora, who gave him the early edge. They tried to hide their secret weakness at all costs from the Kree.\n\nKylor was eventually betrayed by Nenora, as was the entire Skrull race. She assumed power of the empire and wished to keep it for herself. It was Empress S&#39;byll who stepped up to control the Skrulls and finish the war. She was able to resurrect the Super Skrull and he returned to find the empire in shambles. They tricked the Silver Surfer into attacking a [[Badoon]] fleet, which he was not aware were allied with the Kree. Since the Kree waged war on the Surfer, he allied himself with the Skrulls to save Zenn-La from destruction.\n\nTo restore their powers, the Super Skrulls DNA needed to be transferred to S&#39;byll, because only a female could spread the ability to the other Skrulls. The Surfer helped them to power a machine that would return the Empress&#39; shape shifting abilities. The device was successful. With this power she was able to restore every Skrull she touched and became the true Empress of the Skrulls.\n\nShe and Super Skrull waged war with the Kree with the help of the Silver Surfer. She replaced Super Skrull with Captain Reptyl and he helped to change her into an emotionless reptile. But Reptyl was betrayed by one of his own and the Skrull fleet was utterly destroyed by the Kree. S&#39;byll and Silver Surfer went alone to attack the Kree homeworld of Hala.\n\nGaining the knowledge that Nenora was actually a Skrull gave them the advantage. S&#39;byll gave her shape-shifting abilities back to her, crippling her and showing the Kree her true self. A peace treaty was created.\n\nThe Skrulls eventually broke that peace treaty as they kept their military drive and prefer to fight rather than negotiate. Among the other races contained within the Skrull Empire are the Druff, Guna, Kallusina, Morani, Pheragot, Queega, Tekton, and Yirbek races. Other races remain independent, whether through treaties or open resistance. Such races include the Clegrimites, Gegku, Krylorians, Wilameanis, and [[Xandarians]].

The plan involved secretly replacing the real [[Alicia Masters]], The Thing&#39;s blind lover. The plan fell through when she instead seduced Human Torch and the two eventually married one another. The long running facade eventually came to light and the group discovered that the real, human Alicia was actually being held captive by the Skrull nation and Lyja defected, having fallen in love with the [[Human Torch]]. The Fantastic Four rescued her, but Lyja seemingly died in the process as she sacrificed herself to save Johnny when Paibok attacked.\n\nPaibok later revealed to [[Devos the Devastator]] that she was still alive. Paibok, with the assistance of Devos, awoke Lyja from her comatose state and gave her the power to fly and fire energy blasts from her hands (she called herself \&quot;Lyja the Lazerfist\&quot;). These powers were later revealed to come from a special device implanted in her. Joining them in search of vengeance, the three arrived on Earth, and battled the Torch at Empire State University. The Torch panicked, used his nova flame and destroyed the campus. Alongside Devos and Paibok, Lyja witnessed a battle between the Fantastic Four and an alternate Fantastic Four. However, Lyja still bore feelings for the Torch and once again betrayed her cohorts to side with the Fantastic Four.

The Skrulls are known for their physical malleability and ability to [[shapeshift]] to any size, shape, or color at will, taking on the appearance but not the characteristics of other beings and objects. Skrulls are able to assume virtually any form, be it organic (e.g., cows &lt;ref name=\&quot;Fantastic Four #2 January 1962\&quot;/&gt;) or inorganic (e.g., lamp &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Roger Stern|penciller=John Byrne|inker=Kyle Baker|colorist=Christie Scheele|letterer=John Workman|editor=Mark Gruenwald|title=Avengers Annual|volume=1|issue=#14|date=30 July 1985|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;). As a result, the Skrulls excel at spying and infiltration. Skrulls are also able to use their shapeshifting abilities to form weapons (e.g., blades and clubs) with parts of their bodies, making them dangerous hand-to-hand combatants. Their [[sexual dimorphism]] is roughly the same of a human being with the exception that the males are mostly bald and have no facial hair, while females have full head of greenish black [[hair]], but their [[sexual orientation]] is more complex since they can change their genders at will.
