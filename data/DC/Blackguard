The 10 debuted in &#39;&#39;[[Superman]]&#39;&#39; #665 (September 2007) and was created by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Rick Leonardi]]. The 100 debuted in &#39;&#39;[[Superman&#39;s Girl Friend Lois Lane]]&#39;&#39; #105 (October 1970) and was created by [[Bob Kanigher]]. The 1,000 debuted in &#39;&#39;[[Booster Gold]]&#39;&#39; #2 (March 1986) and was created by [[Dan Jurgens]].\n\n==Fictional team history==\n===The 10===\nA story in &#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; #665 shows that during Superman&#39;s early years in Metropolis, there was a smaller organization called the 10, with ties to [[Intergang]]. According to &#39;&#39;Black Lightning: Year One&#39;&#39; #4 (April 2009), they have no ties to the 100 but may have ties to the 1,000.\n\n===The 100===\nThe 100, formerly known as &#39;&#39;El Ciento&#39;&#39; (the one hundred), was founded by 71 men and women from all over Europe who came together in [[Aragon, Spain]] in the year 1462, and named themselves El Ciento in order to honor their 29 dead allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving members of El Ciento combined various scientific, [[arcane]] and [[Alchemy|alchemical]] methods of life extension in order to render themselves [[Immortality|immortal]]. At a later point in time, they were driven out of Aragon by the [[Spanish Inquisition]], but by then they had granted themselves vastly extended lifespans. They later discovered that the only way they could stay alive was to own the land they lived on and to feed off the despair and negative emotions of the human tenants on their lands; they also learned how to become immaterial and possess human bodies. Though most members of El Ciento feed off human suffering, some few have been able to survive by feeding on positive emotions. The immortal known as [[Ra&#39;s al Ghul]] considers El Ciento to be a threat to his plans.&lt;ref&gt;As seen in &#39;&#39;Black Lightning: Year One&#39;&#39; #4 (April 2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA member of El Ciento later established himself in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]&#39;s Southside, an area which would later be known as [[Suicide Slum]]. The 100 held a firm grip on the city&#39;s criminal underworld for years, indulging in crimes such as drug trafficking and racketeering. They later seem to have spread across the country with branches operating in other cities. They have also made enemies of many heroes, including [[Thorn (comics)|Rose and Thorn]] (whose father they murdered), [[Halo (comics)|Halo]] (whom they murdered as well as her parents), and [[Superman]] himself. As the 100, they fought foes like [[Black Lightning]] at the behest of the Metropolis section leader [[Tobias Whale]].\n\n===The 1,000===\nThe Director of the 1,000 was a U.S. senator named Henry Ballard who shepherded the organization&#39;s new direction and goals. Under the Director, the 100 changed its name to the 1,000, where it is attempting to expand their reach to even the [[Oval Office]] with Henry Ballard as the presidential candidate. This plan, however, was thwarted and the 1,000 became the 100 again upon retreating into the shadows. As the 1,000 they fought [[Booster Gold]].\n\n==Members==\n===100 Operatives===\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Ned Creegan|Cyclotronic Man]]&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2014 Ned Creegan, accidentally subjected to an experimental \&quot;purple light ray\&quot;. The ray made Creegan&#39;s skin transparent so that only his skeleton was visible, and charged him with electricity. As &#39;&#39;&#39;\&quot;Bag O\u00b4 Bones\&quot;&#39;&#39;&#39;, he fought [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]].&lt;ref&gt;As seen in &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #195 (September 1967). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; As 100 operative Cyclotronic Man, he later tried to eliminate both Black Lightning and Superman, but was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;As seen in &#39;&#39;Black Lightning&#39;&#39; #4 (September 1977). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Joey Toledo]]&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2014 A drug pusher.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Black Lightning #1\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Black Lightning&#39;&#39; #1.

Upon being saved by [[Intergang]] and joining up with them, Desaad sewed a new face onto him which was made from dead humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Gotham Underground&#39;&#39; #1.

He committed suicide after believing he had murdered Black Lightning.&lt;ref name=\&quot;multiref1\&quot;/&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Syonide II&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2014 The second Syonide was female. She first succeeded the original as an agent of the 100 and fought the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. Later, she became a mercenary in her own right, sometimes working together with Merlyn the Archer.\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Tobias Whale]]&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2014 Super-strong and tough albino enemy of Black Lightning. He is the leader of the 100&#39;s [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] branch.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Black Lightning #1\&quot;/&gt;\n\n===1,000 Operatives===\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Blackguard&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2014 An enforcer for the 1,000 who clashed with Booster Gold.

She was second in command of the 1,000 behind the Director. Mindancer recently reappeared as a prison escapee during &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; where she crossed paths with Kyle Rayner.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Booster Gold #1\&quot;/&gt;\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;Shockwave&#39;&#39;&#39; \u2014 A frequent agent of the 1,000, Arnold Pruett wears a suit of sophisticated armor that endows abilities such as super-strength and generating vibrations capable of leveling buildings.
