Created by writer [[Peter David]], the Pantheon first appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #368 (April 1990), and was a large part of that book's supporting cast from issue #379 (March 1991) to issue #426 (February 1995).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=266}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional organization history==\n[[Agamemnon (comics)|Agamemnon]], a half-human and half-[[Norse mythology|Asgardian god]], is born immortal. Although he never physically ages beyond the age of 16, the Pantheon are all his descendants.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #401 (January 1993)</ref> Stationed in the Mount, their headquarters in a Nevada desert, the Pantheon recruits the [[Hulk]] as a member and ally after he is transformed into the Merged Hulk persona. The Hulk accepts the offer as a means of making up for the damage he's done in his Savage Hulk days.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #382 (June 1991)</ref> The Hulk works with the Pantheon on many rescue and relief missions, the focus of the Pantheon's purpose. In return, several members help the Hulk out with personal missions, which sometimes dovetail into the Pantheon's intended purposes.\n\nFor a while, the Hulk even leads the entire Pantheon. Together they endure attacks by the [[U-Foes]],<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #397-#399 (September - November 1992)</ref> confrontations with X-Factor<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #391 (March 1992)</ref> and a vast space chase when one of the members is kidnapped by a lovesick alien prince. This eventually leads to a confrontation with Agammemnon, who attempts to ensure the long-term survival of his children &mdash; none of whom inherited his immortality &mdash; by offering the Troyjans the pick of his descendants in exchange for technology to extend their lifespan.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #413-#416 (January - April 1994)</ref>\n\nAs Agamemnon raises an army of deceased Pantheon members, the Hulk leads the rest of the team against their former leader in their final battle. The Mount is destroyed during a battle between the Pantheon and Agamemnon's cyborgs, the Endless Knights. Agamemnon and Achilles are slain during the battle.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #424-#425 (December 1994 - January 1995)</ref> Ulysses leaves the group to find Delphi, who had left before the final battle.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #426 (February 1995)</ref> Paris wants nothing to do with the Hulk, but the rest of the team wants the Hulk to return. The Hulk refuses.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #448 (December 1998)</ref> Members of the team all have dense skin due to their [[Asgardians (Marvel Universe)|Asgardian]] heritage, making them highly resistant to physical damage. They also possess superhuman strength, stamina and durability, a healing factor, and they do not age.\n\n==Members==\n* '''[[Achilles (Pantheon)|Achilles]]''' (Helmut Halfling) - Achilles is invulnerable except when he is close to low-level gamma radiation.
