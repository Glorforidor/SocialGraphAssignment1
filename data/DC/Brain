Animation]], after &#39;&#39;[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]&#39;&#39;. It initially ran a total of 99 episodes, along with a feature-length film, &#39;&#39;[[Wakko&#39;s Wish]]&#39;&#39;.\n\n&#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; is a [[variety show]], with short [[sketch comedy|skit]]s featuring a large cast of characters. While the show had no set format, the majority of episodes were composed of three short mini-episodes, each starring a different set of characters, and bridging segments. Hallmarks of the series included its music, character catchphrases, and humor directed at an adult audience.\n\nA revival of the series was announced by [[Hulu]] in January 2018, with at least two seasons to be produced in conjunction with Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation, with Spielberg, Rogel, and many of the main voice actors returning, set to premiere on November 20, 2020, with a second season expected to premiere in 2021.&lt;ref name=\&quot;variety revival date\&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Background==\n\n===Premise===\nThe Warner siblings live in the water tower on the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot in [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;creation\&quot;/&gt; However, characters from the series had episodes in various places and periods of time. The &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; characters interacted with famous people and creators of the past and present as well as mythological characters and characters from contemporary pop culture and television. [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]], the casting and recording director of &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39;, said that the Warner siblings functioned to \&quot;tie the show together,\&quot; by appearing in and introducing other characters&#39; segments.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint1\&quot;&gt;{{cite video\n| people = Maurice LaMarche\n| title = Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Volume 1.

Shown here are the majority of the characters from the series.]]\n{{See also|List of Animaniacs characters}}\n&#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; had a large cast of characters, separated into individual segments, with each pair or set of characters acting in its own plot. The Warner kids, [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]], are three 1930s cartoon stars of an unknown species (one [[Tom Ruegger]] named \&quot;Cartoonus characterus\&quot;) that were locked away in the [[Warner Bros. Water Tower]] until the 1990s, when they escaped.&lt;ref name=\&quot;creation\&quot;&gt;{{cite episode\n| title = Newsreel of the Stars\n| series = Animaniacs\n| network = Fox Kids\n| airdate = September 13, 1993\n| season = 1\n| number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their escape, they often interacted with Warner Bros. studio workers, including [[List of Animaniacs characters|Ralph the Security Guard]]; [[List of Animaniacs characters|Dr. Otto Scratchansniff]], the studio psychiatrist, and his assistant [[List of Animaniacs characters|Hello Nurse]]. [[Pinky and the Brain]] are two genetically altered laboratory mice who continuously plot and attempt to take over the world.&lt;ref name=\&quot;pinkyandthebrain\&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode\n| title = Win Big\n| series = Animaniacs\n| network = Fox Kids\n| airdate = September 14, 1993\n| season = 1\n| number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slappy Squirrel]] is an octogenarian cartoon star who can easily outwit antagonists and uses her wiles to educate her nephew, [[Skippy Squirrel]], about cartoon techniques.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Slappy\&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode\n| title = Slappy Goes Walnuts\n| series = Animaniacs\n| network = Fox Kids\n| airdate = September 15, 1993\n| season = 1\n| number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional principal characters included [[Rita and Runt]], [[Buttons and Mindy]], [[Chicken Boo]], [[List of Animaniacs characters#Flavio and Marita|Flavio and Marita]] (The Hip Hippos), [[Katie Ka-Boom]], and three pigeons known as The [[Goodfeathers]].\n\n===Creation and inspiration===\nThe &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; cast of characters had a variety of inspiration, from celebrities to writers&#39; family members to other writers. Executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] said that the irreverence in &#39;&#39;[[Looney Tunes]]&#39;&#39; cartoons inspired the &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; cast.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Spielberg1\&quot;/&gt; Tom Ruegger created &#39;&#39;[[Pinky and the Brain]]&#39;&#39;, a series [[Sherri Stoner]] had also written for, after being inspired by the personalities of two of his &#39;&#39;Tiny Toon Adventures&#39;&#39; colleagues, Eddie Fitzgerald and Tom Minton. Ruegger thought of the premise for &#39;&#39;Pinky and the Brain&#39;&#39; when wondering what would happen if Minton and Fitzgerald tried to take over the world.&lt;ref name=\&quot;pinkyorigin\&quot;&gt;{{Cite news\n| last = Will\n| first = Ed\n| title = Brain Power: Pinky, genius pal to resume plotting in 1997\n| newspaper = The Denver Post\n| date = June 11, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deanna Oliver contributed &#39;&#39;The Goodfeathers&#39;&#39; scripts and the character &#39;&#39;Chicken Boo&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt; while Nicholas Hollander based &#39;&#39;Katie Kaboom&#39;&#39; on his teenage daughter.&lt;ref name = \&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt;\n\nRuegger modeled the Warners&#39; personalities heavily after his three sons.&lt;ref name=\&quot;origin1\&quot;&gt;{{Cite news\n| title = TV Production: What a Character! Part II of a series: The Evolution of Animaniacs\n| magazine = Animation Magazine\n| page = 12\n| date = July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Warners were portrayed as cartoon stars from the early [[The Golden Age of American animation|1930s]], Ruegger and other artists for &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; made the images of the Warners similar to cartoon characters of the early 1930s.&lt;ref name=\&quot;origin1\&quot;/&gt; Simple black and white drawings were very common in cartoons of the 1920s and 1930s, such as&lt;!--\n\nPlease restrain your intense urge to list more early cartoon characters here. Five major characters are listed already, and eight more are not going to clarify anything.\n\n--&gt; [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]], [[Felix the Cat]], [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], and the early versions of [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]].\n\nSherri Stoner created &#39;&#39;Slappy the Squirrel&#39;&#39; when another writer and friend of Stoner, John McCann, made fun of Stoner&#39;s career in TV movies playing troubled teenagers. When McCann joked that Sherri would be playing troubled teenagers when she was fifty years old, the latter developed the idea of Slappy&#39;s characteristics as an older person acting like a teenager.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt; Stoner liked the idea of an aged cartoon character because an aged cartoon star would know the secrets of other cartoons and \&quot;have the dirt on [them]\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint1\&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Production==\n\n===Producers===\nSteven Spielberg served as executive producer, under his [[Amblin Television]] label. [[Showrunner]] and senior producer Tom Ruegger lead the overall production and writer&#39;s room. Producers Peter Hastings, [[Sherri Stoner]], [[Rusty Mills]], and Rich Arons contributed scripts for many of the episodes and had an active role during group discussions in the writer&#39;s room as well.\n\nThe writers and animators of &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; used the experience gained from the previous series to create new characters cast in the mold of [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Tex Avery]]&#39;s creations.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Spielberg1\&quot;&gt;{{cite web\n| last = Carugati\n| first = Anna\n| title = Interviews: Steven Spielberg\n| work = World Screen\n| publisher = WSN Inc.\n|date=October 2006\n| url = http://worldscreen.com/interviewscurrent.php?filename=Spielberg1006.htm\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011232156/http://worldscreen.com/interviewscurrent.php?filename=Spielberg1006.htm\n| accessdate = May 8, 2007\n| archivedate=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional writers for the series included [[Liz Holzman]], [[Paul Rugg]], [[Deanna Oliver]], [[John P. McCann|John McCann]], Nicholas Hollander, Charlie Howell, Gordon Bressack, Jeff Kwitny, Earl Kress, [[Tom Minton]], and Randy Rogel. Hastings, Rugg, Stoner, McCann, Howell, and Bressack were involved in writing sketch comedy&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt; while others, including Kress, Minton, and Rogel, came from cartoon backgrounds.&lt;ref name = \&quot;airdate1\&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt;\n\nMade-up stories did not exclusively comprise &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; writing, as Hastings remarked: \&quot;We weren&#39;t really there to tell compelling stories&amp;nbsp;... [As a writer] you could do a real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, or you could parody a commercial&amp;nbsp;... you could do all these kinds of things, and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt; Writers for the series wrote into &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; stories that happened to them; the episodes \&quot;Ups and Downs,\&quot; \&quot;Survey Ladies,\&quot; and \&quot;I Got Yer Can\&quot; were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg,&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint3a\&quot;/&gt; Deanna Oliver, and Stoner,&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt; respectively. Another episode, \&quot;Bumbie&#39;s Mom,\&quot; both parodied the film &#39;&#39;Bambi&#39;&#39; and was based on Stoner&#39;s childhood reaction to the film.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint1\&quot;/&gt;\n\nIn an interview, the writers explained how &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; allowed for non-restrictive and open writing.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt; Hastings said that the format of the series had the atmosphere of a sketch comedy show because &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; segments could widely vary in both time and subject,&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt; while Stoner described how the &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; writing staff worked well as a team in that writers could consult other writers on how to write or finish a story, as was the case in the episode \&quot;The Three Muska-Warners\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt; Rugg, Hastings and Stoner also mentioned how the &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; writing was free in that the writers were allowed to write about parody subjects that would not be touched on other series.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Cast===\n&#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; featured [[Rob Paulsen]] as Yakko, Pinky, and Dr. Otto von Scratchansniff, [[Tress MacNeille]] as Dot, [[Jess Harnell]] as Wakko, [[Sherri Stoner]] as Slappy the Squirrel, [[Maurice LaMarche]] as the Brain, Squit and the belching segments \&quot;The Great Wakkorotti\&quot; (Harnell said that he himself is commonly mistaken for the role),&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint1\&quot;/&gt; and veteran voice actor [[Frank Welker]] as Ralph the Security Guard, Thaddeus Plotz and Runt.&lt;ref name = \&quot;airdate1\&quot;/&gt; [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] said that the casters wanted Paulsen to play the role of Yakko: \&quot;We had worked with Rob Paulsen before on a couple of other series and we wanted him to play Yakko.\&quot; Romano said that the casters had \&quot;no trouble\&quot; choosing the role of Dot, referring to MacNeille as \&quot;just hilarious&amp;nbsp;... And yet [she had] that edge.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint1\&quot;/&gt; Before Animaniacs, Harnell had little experience in voice acting other than minor roles for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] which he \&quot;fell into\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint1\&quot;/&gt; Harnell revealed that at the audition for the show, he did a [[John Lennon]] [[impressionist (entertainment)|impression]] and the audition \&quot;went great\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint1\&quot;/&gt; Stoner commented that when she gave an impression of what the voice would be to Spielberg, he said she should play Slappy.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint1\&quot;/&gt; According to Romano, she personally chose [[Bernadette Peters]] to play Rita.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint1\&quot;/&gt; Other voices were provided by [[Jim Cummings]], [[Paul Rugg]], [[Vernee Watson-Johnson]], [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Gail Matthius]].

Notable catchphrases include Yakko&#39;s \&quot;Goodnight, everybody!\&quot; often said following adult humor, Wakko&#39;s \&quot;Faboo!\&quot; and Dot&#39;s frequent assertions of her cuteness. The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all three Warners was \&quot;Hello-o-o, nurse!\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;creation\&quot;/&gt; Tom Ruegger said that the \&quot;Hello-o-o, Nurse!\&quot; line was intended to be a catchphrase much like [[Bugs Bunny]]&#39;s line, \&quot;What&#39;s up, doc?\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint3a\&quot;/&gt; Before the theme song for each \&quot;Pinky and the Brain\&quot; segment, Pinky asks, \&quot;Gee, Brain, what do you want to do tonight?\&quot; Brain replies, \&quot;The same thing we do every night, Pinky: try to take over the world!\&quot; During these episodes, Brain often asks Pinky, \&quot;Pinky, are you pondering what I&#39;m pondering?\&quot; and Pinky replies with a silly non sequitur that changes every episode.&lt;ref name=\&quot;pinkyandthebrain\&quot;/&gt; Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode \&quot;Win Big\&quot;, and then producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint2\&quot;/&gt;\n\n[[Running gags]] and recurring segments were very common in the show. The closing credits for each episode always included one joke credit and ended with a water tower gag similar to &#39;&#39;The Simpsons&#39;&#39; couch gag. Director Rusty Mills and senior producer Tom Ruegger said that recurring segments like the water tower gag and another segment titled \&quot;The Wheel of Morality\&quot; (which, in Yakko&#39;s words, \&quot;adds boring educational value to what would otherwise be an almost entirely entertaining program\&quot;, and ends with a \&quot;moral\&quot; that makes no sense) eased the production of episodes because the same animated scenes could be used more than once (and, in the case of the Wheel segments, enabled the producers to add a segment in where there was not room for anything else in the episode).&lt;ref name=\&quot;dvdint3a\&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Humor and content intended for adults===\nA great deal of &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39; &#39;&#39; humor and content was aimed at an adult audience, revolving around hidden sexual innuendo and throwback pop culture references. &lt;!--In an interview with TV Guide, Tom Ruegger stated, \&quot;We don&#39;t just write for kids[...] We fill the stories with cultural references that people our age \u2014 for the most part, we&#39;re baby boomers \u2014 will understand, as well as [references for] younger people.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;adultjokes2\&quot;&gt;{{Cite news\n| magazine = TV Guide\n| volume = 45\n| date = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; &#39;&#39;Animaniacs&#39;&#39; parodied the film &#39;&#39;[[A Hard Day&#39;s Night (film)|A Hard Day&#39;s Night]]&#39;&#39; and the [[Three Tenors]], references that &#39;&#39;[[The New York Times]]&#39;&#39; wrote were \&quot;appealing to older audiences\&quot;.&lt;ref name=\&quot;adultjokes\&quot;&gt;\n{{Cite news\n| last = Strauss\n| first = Neil\n| author-link = Neil Strauss\n| title = The Pop Life\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/27/arts/the-pop-life-648949.html?scp=2&amp;sq=yakko&#39;sworld&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=2\n| page = 2\n| newspaper = The New York Times\n| date = October 27, 1994\n| access-date = February 14, 2017\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305121308/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/27/arts/the-pop-life-648949.html?scp=2&amp;sq=yakko&#39;sworld&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=2\n| archive-date = March 5, 2016\n| url-status = live\n}}\n&lt;/ref&gt; The [[comic opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] &#39;&#39;[[Pirates of Penzance]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[H.M.S.
