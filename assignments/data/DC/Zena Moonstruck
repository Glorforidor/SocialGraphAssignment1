The principal subject of the comic book is a team of [[fictional]] [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] superheroes. The characters first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]]&#39;&#39; #1 (December [[1988 in comics|1988]]). The original series chronicled the formation and activity of an [[wikt:interplanetary|interplanetary]] [[police force]] whose mission was to act as a peace-keeping force in their galaxy. \n\n==Publication history==\n===&#39;&#39;Invasion!&#39;&#39;===\nThe characters who went on to form L.E.G.I.O.N. were first introduced in the three-part miniseries &#39;&#39;[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]]&#39;&#39;\n\nVril Dox, Garryn Bek, Strata, Lyrissa Mallor, and the Durlan appeared as prisoners of the Alien Alliance who helped stage a breakout from the Starlag, a prison spacecraft overseen by the alien race known as the Citadel.\n\n===&#39;&#39;L.E.G.I.O.N.&#39;&#39;===\n\n&#39;&#39;L.E.G.I.O.N. &#39;89&#39;&#39; debuted in [[1989 in comics|1989]] (as indicated by the title) and reached issue #70 (as &#39;&#39;L.E.G.I.O.N. &#39;94&#39;&#39; in [[1994 in comics|1994]]).  L.E.G.I.O.N. stands for Licensed Extra-Governmental Interstellar Operatives Network.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThis series followed the adventures of Vril Dox and his allies after their escape from the Starlag in &#39;&#39;Invasion!&#39;&#39;.  Dox takes his companions to Colu, where they overthrow the Computer Tyrants running the planet.  They encounter the bounty hunter [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], who had been tracking Bek to exact revenge on him for having accidentally killed one of Lobo&#39;s treasured space dolphins.  Dox smoothly and swiftly turns Lobo into a valued ally.  With this group, Dox decides to form an interplanetary police force.  He bases his operation on the planet Cairn after a difficult and bloody coup against Cairn&#39;s ruler, Bek&#39;s father-in-law, whom Dox shoots point blank.  The series follows the rise, heyday, and fall of this police force.\n\n===&#39;&#39;R.E.B.E.L.S.&#39;&#39;===\n{{main|R.E.B.E.L.S.}}\n\nAs a consequence of the &#39;&#39;[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]&#39;&#39; event, the original title was replaced by &#39;&#39;R.E.B.E.L.S. &#39;94&#39;&#39; (&#39;&#39;&#39;R&#39;&#39;&#39;evolutionary &#39;&#39;&#39;E&#39;&#39;&#39;lite &#39;&#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39;&#39;rigade to &#39;&#39;&#39;E&#39;&#39;&#39;radicate &#39;&#39;&#39;L&#39;&#39;&#39;.E.G.I.O.N. &#39;&#39;&#39;S&#39;&#39;&#39;upremacy) (beginning with issue #0), continuing the same storyline with basically the same characters.  &#39;&#39;R.E.B.E.L.S. &#39;96&#39;&#39; #17 was the last issue.\n\nWhen L.E.G.I.O.N. is usurped by Vril Dox&#39;s son Lyrl, Dox and those members who remain loyal to him (Lobo, Phase, Strata, Stealth, and Borb) are forced to flee in a mysterious new ship in order to regroup and regain control of L.E.G.I.O.N.  Telepath comes along unwillingly.  Garv, Strata&#39;s husband, unbalanced by not understanding recent events, becomes involved in a desire to get Strata back.  Borb (who is in love with Stealth) sacrifices his life in order to protect his friends from an other-dimensional army of brain-stealing entities; the very ones that had created the ship they had been fleeing in.  They soon name the ship the &#39;Di&#39;ib&#39;, after an old L.E.G.I.O.N. hero.\n\nThe team has to fight old friends, such as Zena Moonstruk, Gigantus and Davroth.  Behind the scenes help comes from old ally Marij&#39;n and [[Captain Comet]].  The group also encounters the demonic entity [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], who plays a critical role in the resolution of the main storyline providing the means to defeating Lyrl in exchange for the soul of a future generation of the Dox line.\n\nThe heroes regain control in the last issue, with Vril using the knowledge given to him by Neron to find a way to lobotomize his son, stripping him of his super-intelligence. Dox and Stealth retire to take care of Lyrl, whose brain has been reduced to that of a normal one-year-old, while Captain Comet is placed in charge of L.E.G.I.O.N.\n\n===Post-series appearances===\nIn the [[2004 in comics|2004]] &#39;&#39;[[Adam Strange]]&#39;&#39; (issues #5-8) and the later &#39;&#39;[[Rann/Thanagar War]]&#39;&#39; series (issues #1\u20136 and the &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; special), Vril Dox has resumed control of L.E.G.I.O.N. and is using droids as officers. Adam Strange is pursued by the group in the pages of his own series, framed for the seeming destruction of Rann. Former L.E.G.I.O.N. members have been referred to in the subsequent &#39;&#39;Infinite Crisis&#39;&#39; series, and many make a cameo appearance in one panel of &#39;&#39;Infinite Crisis&#39;&#39; #1, although the lineup appears to be out of date (in addition to Darius&#39; appearance on one of the screens, Bertron Diib is visible between several of the dialogue balloons).  L.E.G.I.O.N. and Vril Dox are mentioned several times, although not shown, in &#39;&#39;[[Mystery in Space]]&#39;&#39; ([[2006 in comics|2006]]) featuring  [[Captain Comet]].  Dox plays a major role in the six-part &#39;&#39;[[Omega Men]]&#39;&#39; [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] (2006-[[2007 in comics|2007]]).\n\n===&#39;&#39;R.E.B.E.L.S.&#39;&#39; (second series)===\n{{main|R.E.B.E.L.S.}}\nIn 2009, &#39;&#39;R.E.B.E.L.S.&#39;&#39; returned as an ongoing series. According to writer [[Tony Bedard]] he originally \&quot;pitched it as &#39;&#39;L.E.G.I.O.N.&#39;&#39; and then the Legion of Super-Heroes exploded.... We needed a title to emphasize that, despite the distant connection to the Legion, this is its own book. We didn\u2019t have to look far.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=18891 Tony Bedard Cries a R.E.B.E.L.S. Yell], [[Comic Book Resources]], November 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=20002 REFLECTIONS: Tony Bedard], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe new series opens with Dox a wanted criminal on the run from a L.E.G.I.O.N. made up of robotic constructs controlled by Silica, a living computer Dox had designed.  While a robot-based, computer-controlled L.E.G.I.O.N. had made it easier for Dox to control the behavior of his police force throughout the 80 worlds under their protection (a common complaint of his in the first series), it also enabled the Star Conqueror (a.k.a. [[Starro]]) to wrest control of L.E.G.I.O.N. from Dox and make himself the de facto ruler of all the client worlds just by corrupting Silica.  The first issues show Dox building his team based on instructions smuggled to him by Brainiac Five, a team that will be the prototype of the future Legion of Super-Heroes.\n\n===&#39;&#39;The New 52&#39;&#39;===\nIn September 2011, &#39;&#39;[[The New 52]]&#39;&#39; rebooted DC&#39;s continuity. In this new timeline, L.E.G.I.O.N. still exists, but it is unclear how much of its history remains intact. L.E.G.I.O.N. officers make a brief appearance in the [[Larfleeze]] backup story in &#39;&#39;[[Threshold (DC Comics)|Threshold]]&#39;&#39; #3. Stealth, a L.E.G.I.O.N. member in previous continuity, also appears in the main storyline of &#39;&#39;Threshold&#39;&#39;, although she is not affiliated with the organization.\n\n==List of characters==\n===Founding members===\n*[[Vril Dox II]] (Genius Coluan; founder and team leader; clone of Vril Dox, the original [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]])\n*[[R.
