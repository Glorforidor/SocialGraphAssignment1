The character was introduced after DC Comics created [[Earth-Two]], a [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel world]] that was [[retcon|retroactively]] established as the home of characters whose adventures had been published in the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. This provided justification within the fictional world of Batman stories for DC Comics publishing Batman comic books that disregarded the character&#39;s Golden Age stories, as Batman had been presented as a single ongoing incarnation of the character since his earliest stories were published.\n\n==Publication history==\nBatman of Earth-Two first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]&#39;&#39; #82 and was created by [[Dennis O&#39;Neil]] and [[Dick Dillin]].\n\nThe character history of the [[Earth-Two]] Batman accordingly adopts all of the earliest stories featuring the character from the 1930s and 1940s, while the adventures of the then-mainstream [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] Batman (who lived on \&quot;[[Earth-One]]\&quot;) begin later in time and with certain elements of his origin retold. Each were depicted as separate, though parallel, individuals living in their respective [[fictional universe|universes]], with the \&quot;older\&quot; Earth-Two character eventually reaching his retirement and death.\n\nA parallel to this character is introduced in &#39;&#39;Justice Society of America Annual&#39;&#39; #1 (2008) entitled \&quot;Earth-2\&quot; where the Post Crisis Earth-2 is fully introduced. The most notable difference between Pre-Crisis Earth-Two Wayne and his newer Post-Crisis Earth-2 incarnation is that the Post-Crisis Earth-2 Joker learned the real identities of Robin and the Huntress after turning Gotham DA Harvey Simms into the new Two-Face (Harvey knowing Helena&#39;s identity already).\n\nA new parallel to this character was introduced in the 2012 &#39;&#39;Earth-2&#39;&#39; series who died in the first issue, protecting that world from Darkseid&#39;s forces, alongside that world&#39;s Superman and Wonder Woman. His father, Thomas Wayne, later took up the mantle to atone for earlier sins, including deceiving his son about his own death. Dick Grayson would also take up the mantle during &#39;&#39;Earth 2: Earth&#39;s End and Earth 2: Society&#39;&#39;. Helena would later don the mantle after Dick retired at the end of the &#39;&#39;Society&#39;&#39; series.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Childhood and early history===\n{{main|Batman}}\nBatman&#39;s origin and history is essentially similar to the Earth-One version of the character, but events unfold in more of a real-time fashion. For example, the Batman makes his debut in 1939, meets [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Robin]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Catwoman]] and [[Clayface]] at various points in 1940, the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] in 1941, [[Two-Face]] in 1942, etc. These dates reflect the publishing dates of the original stories, rather than taking the Earth-One and Modern Age approach of keeping the characters eternally youthful.\n\n* Bruce Wayne was born in [[Gotham City]] circa 1915-1916.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceA\&quot;&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = Secret Origins Starring the Golden Age Batman| Title = Secret Origins| Volume = 2|Issue = 6| Date = (Sept 1986)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Bruce&#39;s parents, [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]], were killed when he was eight years old by a robber named [[Joe Chill]], in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The Batman Wars Against the Dirigible of Doom| Title = Detective Comics| Issue = 33| Date = (November 1939)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a later [[retcon]], Martha died from a heart attack soon after Thomas was shot to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The Origin of the Batman!| Title = Batman| Issue = 47| Date = (June 1948)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Like his Earth-One counterpart, the Earth-Two Wayne is raised by his father&#39;s brother, Phillip Wayne, though he never recovers from his parents&#39; murder and vows to one day wage a war against the criminal underworld in Gotham City. This aspect of the Batman mythos was retconned in the Post-Crisis history established by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Year One]]&#39;&#39;, where Phillip is eliminated and [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] largely raises Bruce. In the Golden Age and Earth-Two reality, Wayne and Alfred meet for the first time in 1943, after Batman has already met [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (and in fact, this version of Alfred is Alfred Beagle - his originally published name which was kept for the Earth-Two distinction).\n* After a period of training, a young Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. His first printed story is \&quot;The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The Case of the Chemical Syndicate| Title = [[Detective Comics]]| Issue = 27| Date = (May 1939)| Publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although story content implies that this was not his first mission.\n* Bruce Wayne meets eight-year-old [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Dick Grayson]], following the murder of his parents by a gangster who he overheard.  Grayson eventually takes the identity of Robin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = Robin the Boy Wonder| Title = Detective Comics| Issue = 38| Date = (Apr 1940)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Batman meets [[Superman]] for the first time and the two heroes soon become lifelong friends. Unlike their Post-Crisis incarnations, they get along right away and often team up over the years. Along with [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]], Batman participates in the [[Justice Society]] and the [[World War II|war-time]] only [[All-Star Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The Mightiest Team in the World| Title = Superman| Issue = 76| Date = (June 1952)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = $1,000,000 for War Orphans| Title = All-Star Comics| Issue = 7| Date = (October 1941)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The World on Fire!| Title = All-Star Squadron| Issue = 1| Date = (September 1981)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Batman dies in 1979.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceB\&quot;&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = Only Legends Live Forever!| Title = Adventure Comics| Volume = 1| Issue = 462| Date = (Mar 1979)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Divergence with Earth-One===\nAt the dawn of the [[Silver Age of comics]], DC Comics decided to reintroduce several of their Golden Age superheroes, all of whom had ceased publication several years earlier. [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] and [[Green Lantern]] were reimagined as [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = Mystery of the Human Thunderbolt!| Title = Showcase| Volume = 1| Issue = 4| Date = (Sept/Oct 1956)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hal Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = SOS Green Lantern!| Title = Showcase| Volume = 1| Issue = 22| Date = (Sept/Oct 1959)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman, having been continuously published since their Golden Age introductions, were not given any reimaginings (although much about the mythos of each had evolved slowly over the years). It was later revealed that the current heroes live on a parallel world to the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age heroes]]:  The newer Silver Age heroes are on \&quot;Earth-One\&quot;, while the older Golden Age characters reside on \&quot;Earth-Two\&quot; (the numbering does not indicate any hierarchy of parallel Earths, only the number by which they were discovered). When Barry Allen met [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = Flash of Two Worlds!| Title = The Flash| Volume = 1| Issue = 123| Date = (Sept 1961)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; it meant there were two Flashes, two Green Lanterns, two Supermen and two Batmen.  Unlike the Silver Age versions of the Flash and Green Lantern, who had entirely different secret identities from their Golden Age counterparts, the Batman and Superman of each world were both Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent, respectively. There is no clear demarcation between when the stories of one Batman ends and the other begins. Indeed, many stories from the 1940s and the 1950s were treated as canon to both incarnations of Batman after the concept of Earth-One and Earth-Two was established;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = Batman meets \&quot;Professor Hugo Strange\&quot;| Title = Detective Comics| Issue = 36| Date = (February 1940)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The Joker| Title = Batman| Issue = 1| Date = (June 1940)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The Cavalier of Crime| Title = Detective Comics| Issue = 81| Date = (November 1943)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The Batwoman| Title = Detective Comics| Issue = 233| Date = (July 1956)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stories from the mid-1950s could have only occurred on Earth-One,&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = When Batman Was Robin| Title = Detective Comics| Issue = 226| Date = (December 1955)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The First Batman| Title = Detective Comics| Issue = 234| Date = (September 1956)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some stories as late as the early-1960s seem as though they could have also occurred on Earth-Two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = Batman&#39;s First Case| Title = Detective Comics| Issue = 265| Date = (March 1959)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = Web of the Spinner| Title = Batman| Issue = 129| Date = (February 1960)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC has mandated that only the Earth-One Batman wore a yellow oval around the bat symbol on his chest, making 1964 the fixed year in which all Batman stories were set on Earth-One,&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The Olsen-Robin Team Versus the Superman-Batman Team!| Title = World&#39;s Finest Comics| Issue = 141| Date = (May 1964)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The Mystery of the Menacing Mask!| Title = Detective Comics| Issue = 327| Date = (May 1964)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = Two-Way Gem Caper!| Title = Batman| Issue = 164| Date = (June 1964)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are several instances where this is contradicted in-story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcindexes.com/planet/weeklyplanet.php?issue=31 |title=\&quot;The Dividing Line Between Earth-1 and Earth-2\&quot; (Part 7) |publisher=Tfaw.com |date=2002-12-02 |accessdate=2011-07-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121124331/http://dcindexes.com/planet/weeklyplanet.php?issue=31 |archivedate=2010-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Earth-Two Wayne made several different character evolutions from the mainstream Batman, as the Earth-Two Bruce accepts his one-time adversary Catwoman as his true love and shares his secret identity with her after her memory is restored of her real life. The Earth-Two Wayne and [[Catwoman]], [[Selina Kyle]], later marry, after she had voluntarily served prison time for her crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The Autobiography of Bruce Wayne!| Title = Brave and the Bold| Issue = 197| Date = (April 1983)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a daughter, [[Helena Wayne]], [[Huntress (comics)|the Huntress]],&lt;ref&gt;First appearance: {{Comic book reference| Story = Divided We Stand!| Title = All Star Comics| Volume = 1| Issue = 68| Date = (Sept/Oct 1977)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the family resides at Wayne Manor where Bruce devotes himself and his fortune to philanthropy. By the early 1960s, Wayne has retired as Batman with Robin taking over crimefighting in Gotham City. He even accepted Wayne&#39;s position in the reformed Justice Society.&lt;ref&gt;Justice Society (Vol 1) #55&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne is later called out of retirement by the ancient god, Mercury to help defeat [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]] along with other superheroes of Pre-Crisis Earth-Two, Earth-One and Earth-S. Several years after, that he again dons his costume to answer the Batsignal when Robin is away from Gotham City, but this adventure ends in tragedy as Batman&#39;s kick causes a criminal to fire his gun wildly, striking and killing Selina Wayne. Bruce burned his cape and cowl that night, swearing to never wear it again. His years of civic volunteerism results in him being named to replace the retiring [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] as Police Commissioner. In this capacity, Wayne is soon mind-controlled by the [[Psycho Pirate]]. Resulting in his declaring the current roster of the [[Justice Society of America]] to be outlaws and he attempts to arrest them.  Once freed from the Psycho Pirate&#39;s control, Wayne clears the JSA of all trumped-up charges.\n\n[[File:adventure462.jpg|thumb|upright|&#39;&#39;Adventure Comics&#39;&#39; #462 (1979), featuring the death of Batman. Cover art by [[Jim Aparo]].]]\nThe elder Earth-Two Wayne is eventually coaxed out of retirement for one last mission as Batman when a thief named Bill Jensen is magically empowered by a sorcerer named Frederick Vaux (possibly the Earth-Two analogue to [[Felix Faust]]) and attacks Gotham City. As when he was eight, Earth-Two Wayne faces an overpowering criminal with a weapon that is greater than himself, though this time it is magical bolts rather than bullets. Already dying of cancer from his years of pipe smoking (as stated in &#39;&#39;Brave and the Bold&#39;&#39; #197), Wayne decides to fight to the death against Jensen, who bears a furious grudge against Wayne, stopping his threat at the cost of his own life.&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceB\&quot;/&gt; In the aftermath of the battle, the public learns that Wayne was Batman&#39;s secret identity. The Earth-Two [[Doctor Fate]] later removes the memory of the battle from the consciousness of the general public, so as to protect the secret identities of Robin and the Huntress, which were also thus exposed, and causing everyone to believe instead that Wayne died of cancer at home on the same day that Batman died.\n\nSeveral years after Bruce Wayne&#39;s death, Batman&#39;s diary was discovered and made public (as described in the limited series &#39;&#39;[[America vs. the Justice Society]]&#39;&#39;). In it, he charged the JSA with treason, being spies for Hitler, resulting in the team being put on trial. It is ultimately revealed that this was a hoax on Batman&#39;s part, designed to set a trap for a longtime Justice Society foe, [[Per Degaton]]. Knowing he was dying and would not be alive to combat Degaton&#39;s as yet unrevealed scheme, Wayne fabricated the treason charges so as to bring about a reexamination of the JSA&#39;s history, giving them clues as how to defeat the time traveling villain. It would prove to be the Earth Two Batman&#39;s final case, solved from the grave. Professor Zee, the scientist who had invented the Time Machine (and someone Per Degaton shot), appeared from it, which he had used to transport himself 40 years into the future, and accused Per Degaton of murder. Per Degaton then shot himself in the head.\n\nAs a tribute to this version of the character, his final formal &#39;appearance&#39; was in &#39;&#39;[[Secret Origins]]&#39;&#39; vol. 2, #6 (Sept. 1986) in the story \&quot;Secret Origins Starring the Golden Age Batman\&quot; by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artists [[Marshall Rogers]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]], a retelling of the Earth-Two Batman&#39;s origin.\n\nIn the limited series &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39;, the [[Anti-Monitor]] destroys most universes, reducing the universe to the [[anti-matter]] universe and a single positive matter universe. Earth-Two \&quot;never existed\&quot; in this new universe&#39;s history, which retroactively removes the Earth-Two Batman from history, blending elements of his past with that of the [[Earth-One]] Batman&#39;s, effectively creating a Batman with a new fictional history.&lt;ref name=\&quot;COIE12\&quot;&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = Final Crisis| Title = Crisis on Infinite Earths| Issue = 12| Date = (Mar 1986)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = The End of the Beginning| Title = All-Star Squadron| Issue = 60| Date = (Aug 1986)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===One Year Later===\nDuring &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39;, senior members of the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]] regain some memories of Earth-Two&#39;s previous existence. [[One Year Later|One year later]], when the [[Gentleman Ghost]] attacks the JSA using powers of limited control over the spirits of the dead, [[Jakeem Thunder]] and the Thunderbolt are assisted in battle by the spirits of various deceased JSA members and allies, including the Batman of Earth-Two. Although Jakeem is confused by his presence, noting that Batman is not dead, the Thunderbolt tells him not to worry about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| Story = ...The Living Must Answer| Title = JSA| Issue = 85| Date = (Jul 2006)| Publisher = DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The New 52===\nIn September 2011, DC Comics carried out a line-wide revision to its superhero comic book series and the fictional histories of their characters, branded as \&quot;[[The New 52]]\&quot;. In this revised fictional history, the Earth-2 Batman is now Thomas Wayne, father to Bruce Wayne. Wayne, a corrupt doctor, works for the Mafia in Gotham City until he fakes his own death, deceiving his son about whether he has survived. The original Batman (Bruce Wayne) discovers his father&#39;s actions and disassociates himself with Thomas. Following Bruce Wayne&#39;s death, Thomas Wayne becomes the second Batman. As Batman, Thomas Wayne uses [[Hourman]]&#39;s Miraclo pills.\n\nAfter Thomas Wayne sacrifices his life to prevent villains from a [[parallel world]] from entering his own, Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Earth 2: Society&#39;&#39; #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==In other media==\nBruce Wayne of Earth-Two&#39;s mask appears in &#39;&#39;[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;[[Starling City (Arrowverse)|Starling City]]\&quot;. It is seen on Lian Yu during [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]]&#39;s narration. Around the end of the episode, Adrian Chase of Earth-Two alludes to a previous encounter with Bruce as he quoted to Green Arrow \&quot;Bruce Wayne once told me that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\&quot;\n\nTwo Earth-Two Batman skins are available as downloadable content for &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]&#39;&#39;. One based on the New 52 Earth-Two Bruce Wayne, and the other on the New 52 Earth-Two Thomas Wayne. The last skin is also available as downloadable content for &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]&#39;&#39;.\n\n==See also==\n* [[All-Star Squadron]]\n* &#39;&#39;[[America vs. The Justice Society]]&#39;&#39; \u2014 A miniseries in which Batman (through his diary, discovered post-mortem) accuses the JSA of committing [[treason]] during World War II\n* [[Batman]]\n* [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Golden Age Robin]]\n* [[Catwoman#Golden and Silver Age versions|Golden Age Catwoman]]\n* [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)]]\n* [[Multiverse (DC Comics)]]\n* [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Superman of Earth-Two]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.today/20121209190627/http://www.dcindexes.com/indexes/indexes.php?character=7 Mike&#39;s Amazing World of DC Comics: Earth-Two Batman Index]\n* [http://www.cosmicteams.com/jsa/batman/index.htm The Golden Age Batman Chronology]\n* [http://www.comicsarchives.org/JSA%20FAct%20File/BATMAN.html JSA Fact File: Batman]\n\n{{Batman}}\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{Justice Society of America}}\n{{All-Star Squadron}}\n{{Earth-Two}}\n\n[[Category:Batman characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dick Dillin]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dennis O&#39;Neil]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1939]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1970]]\n[[Category:DC Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Earth-Two]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from parallel universes]]\n[[Category:Fictional detectives]]\n[[Category:Fictional escapologists]]\n[[Category:Fictional police commissioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]&quot;</span>
