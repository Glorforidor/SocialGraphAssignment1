Bonebreaker, as well as Pretty Boy and Skullbuster, avoided being sent through the Siege Perilous along with the other Reavers after being defeated by the X-Men.Following their defeat, Bonebreaker sought out Donald Pierce and Lady Deathstrike to aid in rebuilding the Reavers and defeating the X-Men.
