The Rocketeers also fire rockets as weapons from portable launching equipment they carry.  The Rocketeers' costumes and equipment were designed by the Dire Wraiths for use against the Spaceknights of Galador.  The Rocketeers' costumes are, however, inferior imitations of their prototype, which was worn by the Torpedo until his death.\nThe first group of Rocketeers was a collection of human criminals who were unwittingly being used by the Dire Wraiths to test the costumes.  Later, Dire Wraiths in human form wore the costumes themselves.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRocketeers at The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
