Their name and much of their code of behavior was modeled by the Guardians of the Universe on the [[Martian Manhunter|Manhunters]] of Ma&#39;aleca&#39;andra (Mars) millions of years ago (This creates an apparent chronology problem, since the Manhunters were created many millions of years ago, while the Green Martian race were [[retcon]]ned as having come into existence from the Burning Martians only about 20,000 years ago. For thousands of years, they served the Guardians well. However, the Manhunters became obsessed with the act of \&quot;hunting\&quot; criminals. Their code, \&quot;&#39;&#39;No man escapes the Manhunters&#39;&#39;\&quot; (corrupted from the [[#Chant|original]] \&quot;&#39;&#39;No evil...&#39;&#39;\&quot;), became more important to them than seeing justice done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|last= |first= |year=2004|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=0-7566-0592-X|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Exile===\nEventually, the robots conspired to rebel against their masters, but the Guardians defeated and destroyed most of them. Those that survived hid away on many planets, slowly rebuilding their forces and spreading their beliefs to others. Since then, the over-riding goal of the Manhunters has been to take revenge on the Guardians, as well as on their replacements, the [[Green Lantern Corps]].\n\nThe Manhunters infiltrated and liberated many planets disguised as living beings and created a \&quot;Cult of the Manhunters\&quot; that trained others to be their minions. On Mars, the people of that world started a group of Martian Manhunters based on the lessons of preserving justice taught unto them by the Manhunters and even erected a temple based on the appearance of their inspiration. On Earth, most of the Manhunters&#39; agents were unaware that their masters were robots, or that their real purposes were not noble. Some of these agents became superheroes [[Manhunter (comics)|also known as Manhunters]]. They wore red-and-blue costumes patterned after the Manhunters themselves. The most famous of these was a big game hunter called [[Manhunter (comics)#Paul Kirk|Paul Kirk]]. He was active in the 1940s, and starred in his own series. The character was brought back in a modern version in the 70s, in which he was supposedly killed years before but was in truth placed in suspended animation by a secret conspiracy. He was [[cloning|cloned]], and when he finally reawoke, he dedicated himself to battling those who had used him, eventually dying in the process, but some of his clones survived.\n\nThe Manhunters were discovered by the [[Justice League]] who seemingly defeated the Manhunter&#39;s leader, [[Grandmaster (DC Comics)|the Grandmaster]]. One of their human pawns, [[Manhunter (comics)#Mark Shaw|Mark Shaw]], adopted a new identity as the costumed hero, the Privateer but was later discovered to be a criminal posing as a hero.\n\n===Millennium===\n[[File:Grandmaster (DC Comics).jpg|thumb|A Grandmaster from &#39;&#39;Millennium&#39;&#39; #1.]]\nYears later, it was revealed that the Manhunters not only still existed, but had infiltrated the lives of most superheroes with their agents. They even managed to infiltrate the [[Olympian Gods (DC Comics)|Olympian Gods]], one of their number posing as the goat god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], as shown during the &#39;&#39;Challenge of the Gods&#39;&#39; storyline. They revealed themselves when a Guardian and a member of the [[Zamaron]]s tried to evolve some humans into becoming the next Guardians of the Universe, during what became known as the [[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]] crisis. On this occasion, there was a massive counterstrike operation by the heroes against the Manhunters, and it seemed that the Grandmaster had finally been destroyed, along with their hidden home planet. Former Privateer Mark Shaw readopted his identity as Manhunter in the wake of the battle, seeking to redeem both the name and himself.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Secret Origins]]&#39;&#39; issue #22, 1988 (&#39;&#39;Millennium&#39;&#39; tie-in focusing on the Manhunters&#39; post-&#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39; [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] history)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Post-Emerald Twilight===\n[[Kyle Rayner]] encountered the Manhunters not long after [[Hal Jordan]]&#39;s destruction of the Guardians and the Central Power Battery on [[Oa]]. The first of the androids encountered a still inexperienced Kyle Rayner and was almost able to defeat him using brute force until Kyle used his wits to outsmart and destroy it (Green Lantern Vol. 3 #117). The next time, multiple Manhunters appeared. They were all sentient individuals, upgraded by a passing alien ship with technology onboard that gave them a hive consciousness. They would capture Kyle in an attempt to use his last remaining Green Lantern ring for their purposes. They failed and Kyle managed to escape (Green Lantern Vol. 3 #129-131).\n\n===Sector 3601===\n[[File:Manhunters 2006.jpg|thumb|right|&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; #12 (July 2006). Manhunter technology. Art by Ivan Reis.]]\n\nWhen the Manhunters were replaced by the Green Lantern Corps, they retreated to Biot, their homeworld in Sector 3601, an uncharted area of space incapable of sustaining organic life. [[Hank Henshaw]], the Cyborg Superman, came to Biot and became the Manhunters&#39; new Grandmaster. He used his mastery over machinery and [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] technology to upgrade the Manhunters with organic enhancements, resulting behavioral developments such as emotions. They seem to have rebuilt the first Central Power Battery originally destroyed by Hal Jordan (under the influence of [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]). Henshaw decided not to interfere in the reformation of the Green Lantern Corps after an encounter between a Manhunter and Green Lanterns [[Hal Jordan]] and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]].\n\n===Sinestro Corps===\n\nThe Manhunters have recently resurfaced as part of the [[Sinestro Corps]]. Some of them carry miniature yellow Power Batteries inside them which are used by the Sinestro Corps members to charge their yellow power rings while others still carry the green ones for taking powers from the Green Lanterns&#39; rings.\n\n===Secret Origin===\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern: Secret Origin]]&#39;&#39; storylines (which revises Hal Jordan&#39;s beginnings), it is revealed that the Manhunters suffered a programming glitch that caused them to wipe out all life in space sector 666, believing it to be evil. It was this event that gave rise to the [[Atrocitus|Five Inversions]], the only survivors of the massacre, who vowed to make the Guardians pay for what their creations had done.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; (vol. 4) #33 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Blackest Night===\nDuring the events of &#39;&#39;[[Blackest Night]]&#39;&#39;, it is revealed that [[Amanda Waller]] and [[King Faraday]] have a deactivated Manhunter in their possession, having recovered it from the Belle Reve swamp after the &#39;&#39;Millennium&#39;&#39; event (which the Suicide Squad had a hand in stopping). Waller sends the Manhunter to Belle Reve in order to assist the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] and the [[Suicide Squad]] in their battle with members of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. Waller ultimately uses a self-destruct mechanism to destroy the Manhunter, unleashing an explosion of Green Lantern energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Six&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #18 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Brightest Day===\nIt was eventually revealed that the programming glitch the Manhunters suffered was caused by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] to prove to the other Guardians of the Universe that there are flaws in an emotionless police force.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39; #63&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The New 52===\nWhile running from the [[Alpha Lanterns]], [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] find dozens of deactivated Manhunters in the Guardian&#39;s Ring Foundry. They re-energize the robots using the Foundry essence in order to fend off the Alphas. However, during the fight, the Manhunters are accidentally fused in a massive bio-mechanic monster.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern Corps V3&#39;&#39; #11&lt;/ref&gt; It as since been revealed that the Manhunters were created to apprehend the First Lantern during a time the Maltusians were still trying to harness the Emerald Light of Willpower in the Emotional Spectrum which they eventually would use as a source of energy to fuel their efforts to police the cosmos.\n\n==Chant==\nThe Manhunters have had a mixture of oaths over the years: \&quot;&#39;&#39;No evil escapes the Manhunters!&#39;&#39;\&quot;, \&quot;&#39;&#39;Death to the Green Lantern Corps!&#39;&#39;\&quot;, and \&quot;&#39;&#39;No man escapes the Manhunters!&#39;&#39;\&quot;\n\n==Highmaster==\n[[Image:Highmaster.jpg|thumb|right|The Highmaster]]\nThe &#39;&#39;&#39;Highmaster&#39;&#39;&#39; is the supreme Manhunter which appeared on Orinda in &#39;&#39;Justice League International #10&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]] | Cowriters = [[J.

The Kryptonian technology was incorporated into the Manhunters by Hank Henshaw on Biot, which enabled them to use the Central Power Battery on Oa as a power source for the Manhunters.\n*Originally the Manhunters used special energy pistols which were charged by the green lanterns which they carried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glcorps.dcuguide.com/profile.php?name=manhunters |title=The Unofficial The Manhunters Biography |publisher=Glcorps.dcuguide.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527200245/http://glcorps.dcuguide.com/profile.php?name=manhunters |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Other versions==\n===Injustice: Gods Among Us===\nManhunter makes an cameo appearance in &#39;&#39;[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]&#39;&#39;&#39;s prequel comic. In a flashback in chapter seven of Year Two, [[Sinestro]] is attacked by a Manhunter, though he easily dispatches it before bringing its body before the [[Guardians of the Universe]].\n\n===Star Trek/Green Lantern===\nIn the sequel to &#39;&#39;Star Trek/Green Lantern: The Spectrum War&#39;&#39;, a year after the Green Lanterns and their various allies arrived in the [[Star Trek (2009 film)|new &#39;&#39;Star Trek&#39;&#39; timeline]], [[Saint Walker]] discovers a Manhunter crashed on a distant moon, with the age of the impact damage suggesting that this Manhunter is native to the &#39;&#39;Trek&#39;&#39; universe rather than coming from the Lanterns&#39; reality.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Star Trek/Green Lantern&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Earth One===\nHundreds of years prior to the events depicted in &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern: Earth One]]&#39;&#39;, the Manhunters wiped out the majority of the Green Lantern Corps and captured the Central Power Battery, which was assumed destroyed. In a reverse of most versions of their origin story, the Manhunters were created by the [[Guardians of Oa]] to replace the Corps, who they felt had become too independent. The Manhunters however turned on the Guardians, killing all but a single survivor who fled to an alternate dimension. The Manhunters carved out an empire in the space previously patrolled by the Green Lanterns, centred on Oa. [[Hal Jordan]], an asteroid miner who had stumbled onto a Power Ring was captured and taken to Oa, which the Manhunters had converted into a mine. Jordan was able to find the Central Battery and summon the remaining Ring bearers to Oa. By creating a controlled feedback loop between the Central Battery and their Rings, the Lanterns were able to destroy the majority of the Manhunters, although the surviving Manhunters still pose a significant threat.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Green Lantern: Earth One Vol 1&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The Manhunters have appeared in the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;In Blackest Night\&quot; voiced by [[James Remar]]. Like their comic counterparts, they were the first before the Green Lantern Corps. However according to the Guardians, \&quot;they couldn&#39;t understand the subtle gradations between good and evil\&quot; (probably meaning [draconian justice) and as such, they were reprogrammed for other tasks such as hunting and guarding. Though the Manhunters did not overtly express resentment for this demotion, they began secretly plotting their revenge against the Guardians for their perceived betrayal. The Manhunters bring [[Green Lantern]] [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] to trial on the planet Ajuris 5 for accidentally destroying Ajuris 4. Unknown to everyone else, the planet&#39;s destruction was faked by the Manhunters with the help of [[Kanjar Ro]], as part of their plan to overthrow the Oans and take the Corps&#39; power source, which they believe is rightfully theirs. Their gambit successfully draws several unassigned Green Lanterns to testify for John, as well as five of the Guardians away from Oa, leaving Oa&#39;s defenses severely weakened when the Manhunters attack in force. The Justice League clears John&#39;s name and then aids in defeating the Manhunters, assisted by the Corps. The lead Manhunter manages to absorb the power of the Central Battery, shedding his metallic form and becoming a giant energy being, but John recites the Green Lantern oath while absorbing the energy of the battery, and by extension the Manhunter, into his ring. He then expels the evil of the Manhunter and restores the Central Battery. This was based on the comics story \&quot;No Man Escapes The Manhunters\&quot;, which appeared in &#39;&#39;Justice League of America&#39;&#39; #140-141 (1977).\n* The Manhunters appear in the &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[Josh Keaton]]. They are seen as illustrations in the episode \&quot;Reckoning\&quot;, in walls of glass that detail the history of the Red Lantern Corps, and are noted to have slaughtered [[Atrocitus]]&#39; race, leading to his transformation into the first Red Lantern. In the episode \&quot;Regime Change\&quot;, [[Hal Jordan]] presents this information to the Guardians, initially believing it to be a lie. However the Guardians shamefully reveal they were indeed responsible for the creation of the Manhunters, and that the machines had massacred a number of innocent planets due to their inability to interact with emotional beings. The second half of the first season shows the Manhunters are being rebuilt to act as the [[Anti-Monitor]]&#39;s foot soldiers. According to both the Guardians and the Manhunters themselves, the cause for the destruction was the Manhunters viewing all emotion as the source of evil and thus seeking to exterminate it.\n\n===Film===\n* The Manhunters are mentioned at the end of &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern: Emerald Knights]]&#39;&#39;. When the Green Lantern Corps are out to build a new planet, Hal Jordan mentions to [[Arisia Rrab]] about how he took on an army of Manhunters, and his only backup was [[Ch&#39;p|a squirrel]].\n\n===Video games===\n* The Manhunters appear in &#39;&#39;[[DC Universe Online]]&#39;&#39;, voiced by [[David Jennison]]. They assist the Sinestro Corps with their fight against the Green Lanterns. Some broken Manhunters were rebuilt into remote fear generators to boost the power of the Sinestro Corps&#39; power rings.\n* The Manhunters were the main antagonists in &#39;&#39;[[Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters]]&#39;&#39;, which was set in the same continuity as the [[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern live-action film]], voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. They ally with [[Amon Sur]] - who resents that his father&#39;s ring went to a primitive like Hal Jordan rather than himself - in an attempt to acquire the [[Parallax (comics)|yellow fear energy]] that the Guardians have acquired in the distant past and use it as a power source for themselves.\n* While not making an actual appearance, the Manhunters are mentioned in &#39;&#39;[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]&#39;&#39;. During a mission on [[Ysmault]], Hal Jordan, [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batman]], [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] stumble upon a shielded door that Jordan suggests must have belonged to the Manhunters in the past, while briefly explaining their origin to Robin.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\nManhunters are featured in the &#39;&#39;[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]&#39;&#39; digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110527200245/http://glcorps.dcuguide.com/profile.php?name=manhunters DCU Guide: The Manhunters]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081222014956/http://alankistler.squarespace.com/journal/2008/9/5/alan-kistlers-history-of-the-green-lantern-part-1.html Alan Kistler&#39;s profile on Green Lantern]\n\n{{clear}}\n{{Green Lantern}}\n{{Justice League characters}}\n{{Suicide Squad}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Dick Dillin]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Englehart]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:DC Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:DC Comics robots]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional artificial intelligences]]\n[[Category:Green Lantern characters]]&quot;</span>
