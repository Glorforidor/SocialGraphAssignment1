The &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; was first mentioned in &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Spotlight]]&#39;&#39; #3 (May 1972), but first shown in &#39;&#39;Marvel Spotlight&#39;&#39; #4 (June 1972). The book subsequently appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Werewolf by Night]]&#39;&#39; #1 (September 1972) and &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Chillers]]&#39;&#39; #3 (February 1976).\n\nThe [[comic book]] series &#39;&#39;Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins&#39;&#39; ran 16 issues, from October 1992 through January 1994.\n\nThe &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; received an entry in the &#39;&#39;[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update &#39;89]]&#39;&#39; #2.\n\n== Fictional book history ==\n=== Origin ===\nChthon, a demonic Elder God who was the Earth&#39;s first practitioner of [[black magic]], was the principal author of the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;. Being academic, Chthon wrote all his collected knowledge of magic into the iron-bound scrolls that served as the first form of the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;. It remained as the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; after most of the demonic Elder Gods were slain by the [[Atum (comics)|Demogorge]] except for Chthon and [[Father Set|Set]]. The &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;{{\u2019}}s power is so vast it took the combined strength and will of both [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] and St. Brendan to contain it. Even together, they were unable to destroy it or its power. [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]] also seemed to believe that use of the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; would grant him sufficient strength to challenge Merlin himself.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\n=== First vampire ===\nHumans first found the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; during the time before [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] sank into the ocean. When [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]] slew [[Thulsa Doom (Robert E. Howard)|Thulsa Doom]], Doom&#39;s followers, the Darkholders, used the Darkhold to create the first [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], [[Varnae]], dying due to wounds suffered in battle with Kull. Varnae consumed one of the Darkholders who attempted to command him, and began creating other vampires. Some surviving Darkholders managed to make off with the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; before Atlantis sank.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Doctor Strange&#39;&#39; III #11/2&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen Atlantis sank, Varnae went into hibernation and did not revive until circa 10,000 BC. He found that some parchments of the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; had been left behind in the Flaming Mountains of Khorasha. Varnae attempted to recover these parchments, now bound into \&quot;The Iron-Bound Book Of Skelos.\&quot; In an altercation with [[Conan (Marvel Comics)|Conan]], [[Red Sonja]], and the sorcerer Zula, Varnae controlled bat-like humanoids called the Afterlings. Zula used a spell from the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;/Chthon Scrolls against Varnae, reciting, \&quot;Shemek Iref Wenek Tjhen Inek It-Ek Chthon Djedeni Emm-Maat Wenen Taeei Hemet Ankh-Ek Isheset Antioo Djedte Nes Sep Iree Nen Renek Anhkhu Wi-Im Valka!\&quot; He then noted, \&quot;I&#39;m sorry the incantation ended where it did--and only hurt Lord Varnae, rather than destroying him.\&quot; To Zula, the words appeared in [[Stygia (Conan)|Stygian]], but it had long been known that Chthon had cast a spell that would make the Darkhold appear intelligible in any language. In any event, Varnae fled.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Conan the Barbarian&#39;&#39; #244-245&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Red Sonja ===\nZula also used the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; against the Set-worshipping sorcerer Thugra Khothan. Later Red Sonja and Zula traveled to [[Shadows in Zamboula|Zamboula]], Zamboula serving as the western part of the Turanian empire. Totrasmek, the priest of the deity Hanuman (note that Hindus also worship a simian deity called [[Hanuman]]), came into possession of the Chthon Scroll/Darkhold. Totramesk had been searching for years for the Darkhold. Zula recovered the Darkhold and used the scrolls to transport himself and Sonja away. Zula noted that the scroll disappeared as a result of the spell.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Savage Sword of Conan&#39;&#39; #194-195&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nLater historians in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] would note that at some point scrolls of the Darkhold were taken East during the [[Hyborian Age]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Doctor Strange&#39;&#39; vol. 3 #13/2&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Morgan le Fay ===\nAfter the Hyborian Age, [[Egyptians]], [[Babylonia]]ns, and [[Hebrews]] came to possess the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; scrolls. [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] bound the scrolls into book form for the first time circa the 7th century. It is around this time they were translated from Chthon&#39;s arcane script into [[Latin]]. [[Brendan|Saint Brendan]] tore them up. Numerous pages from the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; have been scattered across the globe by cults of Chthon-worshipping Darkholders. The usage of a page of the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; would summon the Darkhold Dwarf, a minion or manifestation of Chthon, who would attempt to manipulate and corrupt the page&#39;s invoker.\n\nIn the 12th century, a heretical monk named Aelfric had reformed the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;. This monk was burnt at the stake, the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; with him. The &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; reformed itself, and was purchased by a trader, who was then murdered. By the 17th century, the Vatican came to possess the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;. [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] sent a thief to acquire it for him, but [[Cagliostro]] slew the thief and took it for himself.\n\nAt some point the vampire [[Lord Ruthven (vampire)|Lord Ruthven]] may have possessed the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;.\n\n=== Werewolves ===\nThe &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; was also responsible for the curse of the [[werewolf]]; an 18th-century man named Grigori Russoff had been tainted by the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;, and was subsequently bitten by a werewolf who served [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. Grigori passed this curse of [[lycanthropy]] on to his descendants, including eventually Gregor Russoff and his son [[Werewolf by Night|Jacob Russoff]]. Taboo, the sorcerer, claims to have found the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; in an old [[Balkans|Balkan]] [[castle]]. He used to taunt Gregor Russoff with a possible cure.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mystic Arcana&#39;&#39; #3&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nGregor Russoff came to possess the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;. He would later copy much of its content into the journal of his ancestor, and used it as a journal for himself. Accounts vary as to how he came to possess it. Some say he purchased it, while others say he took it from the sorcerer Taboo. Two accounts say that Russoff bought it. In any event, when he read of the origin of lycanthropy in the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;, Gregor Russoff (whose ancestor Grigori had been a werewolf) also contracted lycanthropy. During this time, Dracula shadowed Russoff.\n\nGregor Russoff attempted to raise Chthon hoping he could cure him of lycanthropy. Chthon instead apparently struck Russoff dead, though Russoff evidently somehow revived. The [[High Evolutionary]] and [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Magnus]] managed to defeat Chthon at this point. Presumably, the revived Gregor Russoff recovered the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; and somehow managed to hide his activities from the High Evolutionary and Magnus for some time. He was later slain by villagers no earlier than approximately 20 years ago.\n\nLater, Russoff&#39;s son Jack also became a werewolf. Recovering the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; from Miles Blackgar, he gave it to a Father Jacquez to translate. Aelfric&#39;s ghost possessed Jacquez. At the end of this struggle, Russoff incorrectly thought that the Darkhold was destroyed. Later, Russoff traveled to [[Transylvania]] with the Indian woman [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] to visit Russoff Manor. There they found Gregor Russoff&#39;s diary. Dracula came to possess the diary, but he left it behind in a blizzard in the [[Alps]] once he learned that the diary contained a copy of the Montesi Formula to destroy vampires. Morgan Le Fay later recovered the diary.\n\nAt some point [[Doctor Doom]] found a part of the Darkhold that allowed him to cast a spell to access [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]]&#39;s Limbo. Also at some point, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] imprisoned a demon called Darklove into a page of the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;.\n\n=== Marvel Zombies ===\nThe &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; played a role in the fifth &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Zombies (series)|Marvel Zombies]]&#39;&#39; series, specifically in the third issue.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Zombies 5&#39;&#39; #3&lt;/ref&gt; In this series, [[Machine Man]] and [[Howard the Duck]] (from the primary Marvel universe) and Jackie Kane (from Earth-483) travel between dimensions collecting samples of the various zombie viruses in order to develop a cure. In this issue, they travel to a universe which contains zombies dubbed \&quot;Raimis\&quot; (a reference to the &#39;&#39;[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|Evil Dead]]&#39;&#39; films directed by [[Sam Raimi]]). In this universe, though, the zombies are controlled by the Darkhold rather than by the [[Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]], which is how they are controlled in the film series.\n\n=== Later appearances ===\n[[Carnage (Cletus Kasady)|Carnage]] was augmented by the Darkhold and was successful in resurrecting Chthon, but were defeated by the Symbiote Task Force (composed of [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], [[Eddie Brock]] as [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]], Claire Dixon and Jubil van Scotter).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Carnage&#39;&#39; Vol. 2. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the &#39;&#39;[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]&#39;&#39; storyline, [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] used the Darkhold on [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]] in order to enhance his powers enough to have [[Darkforce]] shadows cover all of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Empire&#39;&#39; #0&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Darkhold Redeemers ==\n{{Ref improve section|date=June 2010}}\nA group led by [[Victoria Montesi]], the last member of the Montesi family, attempted to curtail the effects of the lost pages of the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;. The group starred in the series &#39;&#39;Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins&#39;&#39;. Many pages of the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; were being passed around by a demonic dwarf. The recipients of the page could use them to grant a wish at the cost of their soul; the wish tends to go horrifically wrong.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;The Darkhold&#39;&#39; #1 (October 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Victoria Montesi ===\n{{Main|Victoria Montesi}}\n\n=== Louise Hastings ===\nA member of the Darkhold Redeemers. Professor Louise Hastings was an expert in the occult. She spent her career fighting occult or demonic forces, usually alongside her peers and the [[Midnight Sons]]. During the crisis known as the \&quot;Midnight Massacre\&quot; it was Hastings who saved the day by reading from the Darkhold, sacrificing her soul to Chthon. She was killed months later during the \&quot;Siege of Darkness\&quot; by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] who was possessed by Lilin blood.  She is survived by her grandson, Jinx.\n\n=== Sam Buchanan ===\nLittle is known about Sam Buchanan. He is an [[Interpol]] agent who is assigned to protect Victoria Montesi after she barely survived an attack by a cult worshipping the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;. After Victoria Montesi disappears and Professor Hastings was murdered, Sam walked away from the occult. He is presumed back at Interpol.\n\n=== Modred The Mystic ===\n{{Main|Modred the Mystic}}\n\n=== Jinx ===\nJinx is the grandson of Louise Hastings, an expert in the occult and a mystic of limited power. It is likely that her experiences in the mystic affected her lineage, although her daughter, Caprice, never demonstrated any mystical abilities. Jinx proved able to access magic to perform small feats without any sort of training.{{issue|date=January 2017}} Jinx&#39;s mother was killed in a struggle over of the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; pages, and he came to live with his grandmother, Louise. Almost instantly, he became caught up in a Darkhold plot to reassemble the pages. Sam Buchanan was an agent of Interpol and was convinced by his superior, DeGuzman, leader of a Darkholder sect, to betray and bring in the Darkhold Redeemers. Jinx followed Buchanan back to a base in the southwest, where he accessed the energy of a page of the Darkhold to disperse a group of guards and free Victoria Montesi.{{issue|date=February 2012}}\n\nAn ally of the Darkhold Redeemers, Blade, was temporarily corrupted by a page of the Darkhold, becoming an incarnation of the Demogorge. Modred teleported Jinx back to New Hope to prevent him from being injured in the battle against the Demogorge.{{issue|date=February 2012}}\n\nJinx accompanied the other Redeemers when they investigated Lt. Frank Walsh after he used the \&quot;Troid\&quot; spell of the Darkhold. Following this, Victoria Montesi accessed a page of the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; to gain healing powers. This resulted in the summoning of the creature Monstrosity, which was drawn to follow Victoria and slaughter those it encountered. Jinx attempted to engage the Monstrosity, but was stabbed in the chest by it. He was mortally wounded, but Victoria appeared and used her magics to heal him instantly. It was at this time that Jinx began training as an apprentice to Modred, much to the consternation of the other Redeemers. Jinx demonstrated the ability to focus mystic energy from his right eye while directly participating in the struggle against Spider-X, another &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; page user.{{issue|date=February 2012}}\n\nModred&#39;s training allowed Jinx to participate in the \&quot;Siege of Darkness\&quot;, amplifying Modred&#39;s power to oppose the forces of the demon Lilith I. Internal strife and misunderstandings amongst the Midnight Sons did briefly turn Jinx against Modred, but they soon resolved this. Jinx accompanied the others to the jungles of Central America to locate the Blood member Truth-Sayer. They succeeded, although Truth-Sayer was incinerated by the Fallen member Metarchus. Following this, in order to protect him against the final battle against Lilith and Zarathos, Jinx was sent to the Vatican to remain under the care of Vittorio Montesi.{{issue|date=February 2012}}\n\n== In other media ==\n* The &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; appears in &#39;&#39;[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Mother of Doom\&quot;.

The &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; is revealed by Coulson to be sought by numerous parties over the years. While its pages appear blank, words will manifest before corporeal readers in their native language. The book was found by Momentum Labs worker Joseph Bauer and his wife Lucy Bauer, using it in their research to create matter from nothing. When they touched it, the text appeared in English to Lucy and German for Joseph. But the lab technician [[Eli Morrow]], became obsessed with the power that the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39; offered, turning Lucy and their co-workers Hugo, Frederic, and Vincent into ghost-like beings. Later, he assaulted Joseph in an attempt to get the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;&#39;s location, putting Joseph in a coma.

Lucy is forced to free Eli from South Ridge Penitentiary as her incorporeal state renders her unable to use the book. She succeeds at the cost of her fellow ghosts. When Eli touches the &#39;&#39;Darkhold&#39;&#39;, the text appears in Spanish. In the episode \&quot;The Good Samaritan\&quot;, Eli and Lucy created a replica of their laboratory at the abandoned Roxxon Power Plant previously owned by Isodyne.

She then proceeds to create various LMDs of the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., creating an alternate reality within a computer reality called the Framework, where she assumes the alias of [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Aida Ophelia / Madame Hydra]].
