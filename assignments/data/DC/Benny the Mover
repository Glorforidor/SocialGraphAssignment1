The series was written by [[Geoff Johns]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Greg Rucka]], and [[Mark Waid]], with layouts by [[Keith Giffen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowsill|first= Alan|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah|chapter= 2000s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 325 |quote = The title was masterminded by writers Geoff Johns, Grant Morrison, Greg Rucka, and Mark Waid, with Keith Giffen providing art breakdowns.}}&lt;/ref&gt; &#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; also led into a few limited series spin-offs.\n\n&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; consists of 52 issues, published weekly for one year, each issue detailing an actual week chronicling the events that took place during the missing year after the end of &#39;&#39;Infinite Crisis&#39;&#39;. The series covers much of the [[DC Universe]], and several characters whose disparate stories interconnect. The story is directly followed by the weekly limited series &#39;&#39;[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]&#39;&#39;.  It was the first weekly series published by [[DC Comics]] since the short-lived anthology &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics#Action Comics|Action Comics Weekly]]&#39;&#39; in 1988\u20131989.\n\n==Format==\nThe use of a weekly publication format is unusual in the North American comics industry, traditionally based upon a monthly publication. &#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; and Batman Eternal (2014/2015) both hold the top position, of being the longest-published serialised weekly comic, published by a major North American publisher. The record was previously held by &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics#Action Comics Weekly|Action Comics Weekly]]&#39;&#39;. The story was originally conceived as being a chronicle of what happened in the \&quot;missing year\&quot; between the end of [[Infinite Crisis]] and the beginning of [[One Year Later]]. It would especially focus on how the world dealt with the disappearance of the \&quot;big three\&quot; heroes in the DCU, [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]. As the series went on, it became more of a platform for which to set the stage for upcoming storylines in the DC Universe.\n\n==Back-up stories==\n\n===History of the DC Universe===\nA backup story titled &#39;&#39;History of the DC Universe&#39;&#39; appears in Weeks 2 through 11, with the creative team of [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[Art Thibert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=6410 | title=DC Comics Solicitations for Product Shipping, May 2006 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=February 13, 2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026235244/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article | archivedate=October 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reminiscent of DC&#39;s earlier &#39;&#39;[[History of the DC Universe]]&#39;&#39; limited series, in this story, [[Donna Troy]] explores the history of the [[DC Universe]] with the help of [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]]&#39;s recording device. In the final chapter, both the device and a [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] inform Donna Troy that she was supposed to have died instead of [[Jade (comics)|Jade]].\n\n===Secret Origins===&lt;!--delete list if needed--&gt;\nWeeks 12 through 51 feature &#39;&#39;[[Secret Origins]]&#39;&#39;, written by Mark Waid with a rotating team of artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92806 | title=5.2 (or so) About 52: Week 30 | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=December 1, 2006 | url-status=dead  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210192827/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92806 | archivedate=December 10, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=August 2009}}\nIn the aftermath of &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39;, [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Wonder Woman]] have temporarily retired their costumed identities, and the remaining heroes attend a memorial for [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. Time traveler [[Booster Gold]] attends the memorial, but when Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman do not arrive as he expects, he suspects his robot sidekick [[Skeets (DC Comics)|Skeets]] is malfunctioning. After Skeets reports other incorrect historical data, Booster searches fellow time traveler [[Rip Hunter]]&#39;s desert bunker for answers, but finds it littered with enigmatic [[#Rip Hunter&#39;s lab|scrawled notes]] and photos of himself and Skeets surrounded by the words \&quot;his fault\&quot; with arrows pointing toward them. Booster&#39;s reputation is ruined by his unscrupulous attempts to maintain his [[corporation|corporate]] sponsorships, as well as the arrival of a mysterious new superhero named [[Supernova (comics)|Supernova]].  Booster tries to regain the spotlight by containing an exploding [[nuclear submarine]], but is seemingly killed in the attempt. Skeets uses Booster&#39;s ancestor Daniel Carter to regain access to Hunter&#39;s lab, where he sees the photos and arrows pointing at Skeets himself. Realizing that Hunter is aware of his plan, Skeets traps Carter in a [[time loop]] in the bunker and sets out to locate Hunter himself. He eventually corners Hunter and Supernova in the bottle-city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]], where Supernova reveals himself to be Booster Gold, having faked his death with the help of Hunter to uncover Skeets&#39; true intentions. Hunter and Booster attempt to trap Skeets in the [[Phantom Zone]], but Skeets appears to consume the sub-dimension and pursues his two adversaries through time.\n\n[[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]], the Elongated Man, is told that the gravestone of his dead wife [[Sue Dibny|Sue]] has been vandalized with an inverted version of Superman&#39;s \&quot;S\&quot; symbol, the [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] symbol for resurrection. He confronts [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Cassandra Sandsmark]], and she tells Dibny that she is in a cult which believes that [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] can be resurrected, but they would like to try it first with Sue. Despite his initial consent, Dibny and his friends disrupt the ceremony, and the effigy of Sue crawls to Dibny, calling out to him as it burns; Dibny suffers a nervous breakdown as a result. Ralph seeks out the helmet of [[Doctor Fate]], which promises to revive Sue if he makes certain sacrifices. With unwilling assistance of a demon he tied into knots using Gingold, Dibny journeys with the helmet through the [[afterlife|afterlives]] of several cultures, where he is cautioned about the use of magic for personal gain. After several failed attempts to resurrect his wife, Dibny prepares a spell in [[Doctor Fate]]&#39;s home, the Tower of Nabu. Dibny puts the helmet on, points the gun at his temple, then shoots the helmet to reveal it is actually the sorcerer [[Felix Faust]]. Faust was posing as Nabu to give Dibny&#39;s soul to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for his freedom. Neron kills Dibny, but realizes too late that Dibny&#39;s spell has trapped him and Faust inside a circle of binding that can only be undone by the person who originally created it. With Ralph&#39;s death, Neron and Faust are seemingly trapped together in the tower for all eternity. Ralph and Sue Dibny are reunited in death as ghost detectives.&lt;ref name=\&quot;dc-elon\&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | author-link=Scott Beatty | contribution=Elongated Man | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=114 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[New York City|New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Lex Luthor]] announces the Everyman Project, a program designed to give ordinary people superpowers. [[John Henry Irons]] deactivates his niece [[Natasha Irons|Natasha]]&#39;s Steel armor after an argument about responsibility, then denies her pleas to be allowed to join the Everyman project. Following an encounter with Luthor, Irons&#39; skin transforms into [[stainless steel]], causing Natasha to accuse him of hypocrisy. Out of spite, she enrolls in the Everyman Project and becomes a member of Luthor&#39;s superhero team [[Infinity, Inc.]]  Irons learns that Luthor can deactivate Everyman Project-given abilities and that they expire naturally after approximately six months. Luthor negates the powers of one of Natasha&#39;s teammates during a battle with fatal results, and Irons uses the death of her friend to convince Natasha to question Luthor&#39;s motives. After Luthor, angered by reports that he is incompatible with the treatment, deactivates the powers of the majority of the Everyman subjects on New Year&#39;s Eve, resulting in many of them falling from the sky to their deaths, Natasha works undercover to expose Luthor. Luthor eventually learns the reports were falsified by employees out of fear for what he might do with genuine superpowers, and gives himself the powers of Superman. He discovers Natasha&#39;s spying and beats her violently using his newfound powers. Irons and the [[Teen Titans]] attack Lexcorp and bring Luthor to justice with Natasha&#39;s help. [[Beast Boy]] offers Natasha, in her rebuilt Steel armor, membership in the Teen Titans, but she declines in favor of forming a new team with her uncle.\n\n[[Animal Man]], [[Starfire (Koriand&#39;r)|Starfire]], and [[Adam Strange]] are marooned on an alien planet after the events of &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39;. They are pursued through space by agents of [[Lady Styx]], whose forces are conquering and overrunning planets on a path of destruction toward Earth. They are rescued and joined by [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], who possesses the [[Emerald Empress|Emerald Eye of Ekron]] and claims he has found religion and turned his back on violence for the sake of his beloved Space Dolphins. Lady Styx hired Lobo to capture the heroes, but he instead delivers them to her so they can fight her. The heroes triumph, but not before encountering the Emerald &#39;&#39;Head&#39;&#39; of Ekron, a [[Green Lantern]] who fights alongside them to reobtain his eye (which is, in fact, a supercharged [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]]). During the fight, Animal Man is injected with a toxin and dies. After Starfire and Strange lay his body to rest and leave, Animal Man awakens to find the aliens who gave him his powers standing over him, upgrading his powers to allow him to gain powers from any sentient being in the universe. Animal Man acquires the powers of [[Sun-Eater]]s, which he uses to return to Earth. He is pursued by Lady Styx&#39;s assassins, who are killed by Starfire just as they arrive at his home.\n\n[[Black Adam]], the superhuman leader of Kahndaq, forges a coalition with several other countries against the [[United States]]&#39; superhuman supremacy under the Freedom of Power Treaty until [[Isis (DC Comics)#Adrianna Tomaz|Adrianna Tomaz]], a former slave, shows Adam how he can use his abilities more peacefully to help his country. Adam convinces [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to give Tomaz the power of Isis, and Adam and Isis free enslaved children across [[Africa]]. The [[Question (comics)|Question]], [[Renee Montoya]], and [[Batwoman]], meanwhile, discover that [[Intergang]] is preparing to invade [[Gotham City]]. Following a lead, the Question and Montoya fly to Kahndaq, where they prevent a [[suicide bombing]] at Black Adam and Isis&#39; wedding, for which Adam awards them one of Kahndaq&#39;s highest honors. The four uncover Intergang, which is inducting children into a religion of crime based on its Crime Bible. Black Adam finds Isis&#39; crippled brother Amon among the children and shares his power with him, and Amon is reborn as [[Osiris (DC Comics)#Osiris, Amon Tomaz|Osiris]]. Osiris befriends a seemingly timid anthropomorphic crocodile named [[Sobek (comics)|Sobek]], who joins Black Adam&#39;s [[Marvel Family#Black Marvel Family members|Black Marvel Family]]. Adam and Isis inform the Freedom of Power Treaty member nations that Kahndaq is no longer interested in consolidating power or in executing superhumans.\n\n[[Will Magnus]], creator of the [[Metal Men]], is abducted to Oolong Island, where Intergang and [[Chang Tzu]] are forcing kidnapped [[#The Science Squad|scientists]] to develop new weapons for them. Magnus&#39; anti-depressants are confiscated and he is ordered to build a Plutonium Man robot, but Magnus also secretly rebuilds miniature versions of the Metal Men.  The scientists activate three of their Four Horsemen of [[Apokolips]], which target Black Adam. Suspicious of Black Adam, [[Amanda Waller]] destroys Osiris&#39; reputation by maneuvering him into killing the [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]] and leaking footage of the incident to the media. Osiris retires from the public eye as a result, and acid rain ravages Kahndaq. Osiris, convinced that he is the cause of Kahndaq&#39;s new miseries, asks Captain Marvel to remove his powers, but he is confronted by Isis and Black Adam and returns to Kahndaq. Sobek tricks Osiris into turning back into Amon and devours him, revealing himself to be the fourth Horseman, Famine. The other Horsemen battle Black Adam and Isis. Isis is poisoned by Pestilence and dies while asking Adam to avenge her and Osiris&#39; deaths.\n\nGrief-stricken and enraged to the point of madness, Black Adam destroys the country of Bialya, base of the Four Horsemen, and murders the country&#39;s entire population before killing the last of the Horsemen. He attacks Oolong Island, but the scientists capture and imprison him. The [[Justice Society of America]] invade the island to arrest Adam and subdue the scientists, but Adam escapes and embarks on [[World War III (DC Comics)|a week-long rampage across the globe]], during which he kills several superhumans. During an enormous battle between many superhumans and Black Adam, Captain Marvel is unable to convince the [[Egyptian pantheon]] to remove Adam&#39;s powers, so he instead reverts him to Teth-Adam and changes Adam&#39;s magic word from \&quot;Shazam\&quot; to a new phrase. Teth-Adam goes missing in the resulting explosion and wanders the Earth powerlessly as he tries to guess the new magic word. He is seen wearing boots made from Sobek&#39;s skin.\n\nThe Question and Montoya train with [[Richard Dragon]] in [[Nanda Parbat]], where Montoya learns that the Question is dying from lung cancer and wants her to replace him. After they discover a prophecy in the Crime Bible about [[Batwoman#Kate Kane|Batwoman]]&#39;s death, the two join her fight against Intergang in Gotham City. When the Question&#39;s condition worsens, Montoya journeys back to Nanda Parbat in a failed attempt to save his life. Shortly after they leave Gotham, Intergang discovers Batwoman&#39;s identity and attempts to sacrifice her to fulfill the prophecy. Montoya, as the new Question, joins [[Nightwing]] and former Intergang member [[Kyle Abbot]] in trying to save Batwoman, but they are unable to prevent Mannheim from stabbing her with a ceremonial dagger. Batwoman fatally wounds Mannheim and survives. After she recovers, Montoya shines the restored [[Bat-Signal]] to call Batwoman back to work.\n\nSkeets is revealed to be [[Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil|Mister Mind]], who has been using Skeets&#39; metallic body as a cocoon to metamorphose into a gigantic, monstrous form that feeds on [[time]] itself. Rip Hunter and Booster escape to the end of the Infinite Crisis, where they witness the secret creation of 52 identical [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], which Mister Mind intends to consume. Daniel Carter reappears as the new Supernova and saves Hunter and Booster, restoring the Phantom Zone in the process. Mister Mind alters events in the 52 universes, creating new histories and a new status quo for each. Booster and Supernova trap Mister Mind in the remains of Skeets&#39; shell and send him back in time to the beginning of the year, where he is captured by Dr. Sivana, trapped in a time loop for all eternity. Hunter, Booster, and Supernova agree to keep the restored multiverse&#39;s existence a secret, and Will Magnus rebuilds Skeets, using a copy he had made of the robot&#39;s memories.\n\n===World War III===\n{{Main|World War III (DC Comics)#52}}\nWeek 50 of &#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; and the four-issue &#39;&#39;[[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]&#39;&#39; [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], which was released the same week, depict the superhumans&#39; battle with Black Adam. &#39;&#39;World War III&#39;&#39; also depicts [[Aquaman]]&#39;s transformation into the &#39;&#39;Dweller of the Depths&#39;&#39;, [[Martian Manhunter]]&#39;s change in outlook, [[Donna Troy]]&#39;s assumption of the [[Wonder Woman]] mantle, [[Supergirl]]&#39;s return to the 21st century, [[Jason Todd]] pretending to be [[Nightwing]], and [[Cassandra Cain]] being drugged to turn evil and join [[Deathstroke]].\n\n==Science Squad==\nThe Science Squad are a group of fictional [[scientist]]s and [[mad scientist]]s in the DC Comics Universe. The group was created by writer [[Grant Morrison]] who stated, \&quot;I love writing cowardly, petulant, irascible supervillains much more than I enjoy writing truly evil ones, so this whole plot strand was a joy from beginning to end.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900 |title=The 52 Exit Interviews: Grant Morrison |work=Newsarama |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209073525/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900 |archivedate=December 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the team are [[Veronica Cale]], [[Doctor Death (comics)|Doctor Death]], [[Doctor Sivana]], [[I.Q.

The six-issue &#39;&#39;52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen&#39;&#39; miniseries covers the Four Horsemen&#39;s battle with Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. &#39;&#39;Black Adam: The Dark Age&#39;&#39;, another six-issue miniseries, follows Teth-Adam&#39;s quest to restore his powers and bring Isis back to life; it takes place between the end of &#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; and [[Mary Marvel]]&#39;s corruption in &#39;&#39;Countdown to Final Crisis&#39;&#39;.\n\nTwo strands of the &#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; story were taken and put together with back-ups from the new &#39;&#39;Countdown to Final Crisis&#39;&#39; story. &#39;&#39;Countdown to Adventure&#39;&#39; looks at the fate of space-travelers Adam Strange, Animal Man, and Starfire in their new roles after their journey over the course of eight issues, with a back-up story following Forerunner. &#39;&#39;Countdown to Mystery&#39;&#39; is another eight-issue series looking at the new Doctor Fate and a back-up story focusing on [[Eclipso]].\n\nThese include:\n* &#39;&#39;[[Booster Gold (comic book)|Booster Gold]]&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #1-47 \u2013 The further adventures of Booster Gold, Supernova, and Rip Hunter as they try to preserve the fractured timeline.\n* &#39;&#39;[[Black Adam#Countdown/Black Adam: The Dark Age|Black Adam: The Dark Age]]&#39;&#39; #1-6 \u2013 In the aftermath of &#39;&#39;World War III&#39;&#39;, Black Adam tries to recoup his losses, for both his powers and his personal life.\n* &#39;&#39;[[List of Infinity Inc. members#Second roster|Infinity Inc.]]&#39;&#39; #1-12 \u2013 Steel and the remaining members of Luthor&#39;s Everyman Project team together to form a new Infinity Inc.\n* &#39;&#39;[[Crime Bible|52 Aftermath: Crime Bible - Five Lessons of Blood]]&#39;&#39; #1-5 \u2013 The Question and Batwoman investigate crimes, leading them deeper into the Crime Bible.\n* &#39;&#39;52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen&#39;&#39; #1-6 \u2013 Follows [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Wonder Woman]] against the Four Horsemen of Apokolips.\n* &#39;&#39;[[Metal Men]]&#39;&#39; #1-8 \u2013 Follows [[Will Magnus|Dr. William \&quot;Will\&quot; Magnus]] and the new version of the Metal Men as they battle Will&#39;s brother, David, who wants to destroy them.\n* &#39;&#39;[[Detective Comics]]&#39;&#39; \u2013 Follows Batwoman and the Question.\n* &#39;&#39;[[Great Ten|The Great Ten]]&#39;&#39; #1-9 \u2013 Follows the Chinese superteam.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Action figures===\nIn September 2006, [[DC Direct]] premiered a line of [[action figure]]s based on &#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39;. The first wave, featuring figures based on Batwoman, Isis, Booster Gold, Animal Man, and Supernova, was released in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;DC Comics.com DC Direct [http://www.dccomics.com/dcdirect/?cat=ACTION+FIGURES&amp;lst=allp \&quot;Action Figures - ALL\&quot;],  accessed April 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Novelization===\n[[Ace Books]], under the imprint of the Berkley Publishing Group and published by the Penguin Group, released a [[novelization]] written by [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]], with cover art by J. G. Jones and Alex Sinclair, and its design by George Brewer.\n\nThe novel primarily adapts the weekly limited series and the &#39;&#39;World War III&#39;&#39; tie-in miniseries. The novel deals with the plotlines of Montoya, the Question, Black Adam, Booster Gold, Skeets, and the 52 Earths, dropping the Luthor/Steel/Everyman Project, Ralph Dibny, and space plotlines completely and including only part of the \&quot;Science Squad\&quot; storyline, keeping in the evil geniuses and their work for Intergang but leaving out Will Magnus&#39; ongoing plot; in his introduction, Cox explains that it was not possible to adapt all the plotlines of &#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; within a novel of reasonable length. Outside of the loss of these various storylines from the book, events play out in an essentially identical manner, with most of the dialogue itself even lifted from the comics verbatim. There are some minor cosmetic changes along the way (for instance, on Week 3, Black Adam kills [[Intergang]] thug [[Rough House (DC Comics)|Rough House]] as opposed to [[Terra-Man]]), but in the final chapter, a &#39;&#39;lot&#39;&#39; of the specifics of Mister Mind&#39;s cross-time battle with Rip Hunter, Booster Gold, and Supernova are altered. The villain reveals himself in front of a gathered group of heroes in Metropolis, rather than to just Booster and Rip in the [[Fortress of Solitude]]; the rebirth of the multiverse is credited to Mister Mind&#39;s transformation, rather than the Crisis; and the weapon stolen from Steel by Booster during World War III is actually put to use against Mind, which it was not in the comic, and is the cause of his unexplained-in-the-comic shrinking.\n\n===Audiobook===\nIn December 2007, GraphicAudio released the first half of a full cast audiobook adaptation based on the novel by Greg Cox. Like GraphicAudio&#39;s [[Infinite Crisis#Audiobook|audiobook of Infinite Crisis]], this spans two volumes (each 6 hours long) with 6 CDs and features a full cast, music, and sound effects.
