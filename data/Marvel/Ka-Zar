The second character to bear the '''Ka-Zar''' name, he was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #10 (March [[1965 in comics|1965]]).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/kazar.htm |title=Ka-Zar}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Ka-Zar by Jack Kirby.jpg|190px|thumb|left|Cover to ''the X-Men'' #10 the first appearance of Ka-Zar and his [[Smilodon|sabretooth tiger]], [[Zabu]].<br>Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]\nThe second Ka-Zar started as a similar character, but reminiscent of both [[Tarzan]] and of writer-artist [[Joe Kubert]]'s 1950s [[caveman]] character, [[Tor (comic book)|Tor]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #10 (March 1965), he lives in the [[dinosaur]]-populated [[Savage Land]], which was hidden beneath [[Antarctica]] by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]. The character was based on his pulp magazine namesake only to the extent that he used the same name and rough \"jungle lord\" concept, and Lee has admitted that he had never even read any of the original Ka-Zar stories.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| pages= 19\u201320|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nOriginally written as a primitive and belligerent savage who spoke in broken English, Ka-Zar later became more articulate and civilized, although he retained a certain degree of distrust toward civilization and was generally wary of outside visitors to the Savage Land. Kevin Plunder refers to himself as the \"Lord of the Savage Land,\" a phrase others have adopted, but this is not a formal title.\n\nKa-Zar's first solo story was published in ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #19 (1969), and the character had features in the black-and-white magazine ''[[Savage Tales]]'' and the color title ''[[Astonishing Tales]]''.  He has had five self-titled series, the first published in 1970\u20131971 (three issues, mostly reprints), the second, which continued the storyline from ''Astonishing Tales'', in 1974-1977 (20 issues, subtitled ''Lord of the Hidden Jungle'') by [[Mike Friedrich]], [[Gerry Conway]], and [[Doug Moench]], the third in 1981-1984, ''Ka-Zar the Savage'', (34 issues) by [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] and [[Mike Carlin]], the fourth in 1997-1998 (20 issues) written by [[Mark Waid]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20710 Ka-Zar, 1997], Pipeline, [[Comic Book Resources]], April 7, 2009</ref> and drawn by [[Andy Kubert]], and the fifth in 2011 (5 issue miniseries) written by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nKa-Zar is Kevin Reginald, Lord Plunder, born in Castle Plunder, [[Kentish Town]], [[London]], [[England]]. He is the eldest son of Lord Robert Plunder, the [[England|English]] [[nobility|nobleman]] who discovered the [[Savage Land]]. After his mother had died and his father was killed by the barbaric Man-Ape natives of the Savage Land, Plunder was found and raised by the [[smilodon|sabertooth tiger]] [[Zabu]], who possesses near-human intelligence thanks to a [[mutation]] caused by radioactive mists.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=107}}</ref> \"Ka-Zar\" means \"Son of the Tiger\" in the language of the Man-Apes. Ka-Zar and Zabu are constant partners. Ka-Zar became an expert hunter, trapper, and fisherman, living off the wild land.\n\nIn the Savage Land, some territories are populated by several human or humanoid tribes, and while most of them are on friendly terms with Ka-Zar, some of them consider him an outlander and an enemy. He acts more like an unofficial general protector, preventing outside commercial exploitation, such as [[poaching]] and [[mining]], as well as enforcing peace between tribes and serving as goodwill ambassador to friendly visitors.\n\nThe original [[X-Men]] discovered the Savage Land, and Ka-Zar encountered them, battling Maa-Gor for the first time.<ref>''X-Men'' #10</ref> He then encountered [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] for the first time, and battled his brother Parnival, who had become the [[supervillain]] called the [[Plunderer (character)|Plunderer]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #12-14</ref> He first battled [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Savage Land Mutates]] alongside the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #61-63.

The X-Men are recurrent visitors to the Savage Land and Ka-Zar has been a frequent ally, helping the mutant team defeat both inside and outside menaces such as [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] and Magneto. He has met Spider-Man on several occasions, one of which involved stopping [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]] from invading New York City with Savage Land dinosaurs. Ka-Zar has also assisted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their attempt to repel the space conqueror [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]], but while they rescued many [[Savage Land Races|natives]], they were unable to prevent the destruction of the Savage Land.

Just then, the Captain America from the ship attacked thinking the same for Spider-Man. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu help Spider-Man fight the Captain America from the ship until he is hit by a dart that causes him to regress to a Skrull named Pitt'o Nili, who is killed by Shanna while still believing himself to be Captain America due to the extensive mind conditioning carried out on him.<ref>''New Avengers'' #42.
