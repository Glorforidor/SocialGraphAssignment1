Originally named Azura, but her father [[Zuras]] had her name changed by royal decree to resemble that of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]' daughter [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]] (Roman name Minerva) to seal the treaty between the Olympian gods and the Eternals, in which the Eternals would act as the gods representatives on Earth, with Thena serving as Athena's personal representative. Due to this, she has often been mistaken for Athena and Minerva. The city of [[Athens]] was apparently built for her, not the goddess, although Thena later allowed it to be conquered by the [[Sparta]]ns in 404 B.C.\n\nThena became a scholar and a warrior as she grew. She encountered [[Kro (comics)|Kro]] in [[Babylon]] 2,500 years ago. He had a chance to slay her, but did not; as the years passed, the two of them grew closer together. Thena and Kro made love during the [[Vietnam War]], resulting in Thena becoming pregnant with twins. She placed them inside of Ms. Ritter, an infertile woman, who raised them as her own twin children, [[Donald & Deborah Ritter|Donald and Deborah]].<ref>revealed in ''Eternals: The Herod Factor'' #1</ref>\n\n=== Modern Age ===\nIn recent times, the eternals and deviants revealed themselves to the human world. When Warlord [[Kro (comics)|Kro]]led his armies in an attack on [[New York City]], Thena opposed him to help rescue [[Sersi]]. Thena was reunited with Kro, and publicly declared herself to be an Eternal.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #5</ref> After Kro called a truce, he brought her to the Deviant city of Lemuria to try to resume his relationship with her. However Thenas was horrified with the Deviants' customs including the mass killing of ''undesirebles''. Thena meet Brother Tode, the leader of the deviants and watched a gladiator match  between Deviant champions.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #6-7</ref> She watched that [[Ransak the Reject]], a genetically stable [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] was fighting the horribly mutated but well-mannered [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]]. Thena was convinced by  [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]] to grant both of them sanctuary and take them under her protection, running away fromLemuria with them. She then participated in the [[Uni-Mind]] with other Eternals to decide what to do with the Celestial crisis.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #8-12</ref> With Karkas and the Reject, she battled Zakka and [[Tutinax]].<ref>''Eternals Annual'' #1</ref> She met and became an ally of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>''Thor'' #285-289</ref> and then battled Athena of Olympus, during a battle between the Olympian gods and Eternals.<ref>''Thor'' #291-292</ref> and then battled Athena of Olympus, during a battle between the Olympian gods and Eternals.<ref>''Thor'' #291-292</ref> \n\nShe and the rest of the Etenals were captured by the Deviants aristocracy, but were rescued by Iron Man (James Rhodes). Thena was contacted by his father 's spirit and proposed to the Eternals the need of go to the space.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #6</ref> She then formed the Uni-Mind again, to decide the matter and battled [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] alongside the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]; she was chosen by the Uni-Mind to stay on Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' #246-248</ref> After Zuras' death and the subsequent departure of most of Earth's Eternals, Thena became [[Prime Eternal]] (leader of the Eternals of Earth), but she was traumatized by her father's death and was being subtly influenced by a Brain-Mine Kro had placed upon her. Thena was angry when few eternals assisted to his crowning ceremony <ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>. In a new conflict with the deviants, Thena meet Kro again and helped him to escape from High Priest [[Ghaur]] 's control.  She thwarted the other Eternals' efforts against Kro and turned against [[Ikaris]] to help save Kro's life, but later relinquished her title to Ikaris after a ceremony, and was banished. She was captured with Kro by [[Ghaur]], and freed from Kro's brain mine; when she learned of the Brain-Mine, she was furious with Kro. She battled Ghaur alongside the Eternals, Thor, and the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #1-12</ref> She was eventually reunited with her children and Kro.<ref>''Eternals: The Herod Factor'' #1</ref>\n\nSome time later a maddened Dr. Damian transformed  [[Ajak]] into a monster through the use of Celestial technology, sending them to kill [[Thena]] and [[Kro (comics)|Kro]]'s twin children, [[Donald & Deborah Ritter]]. The monstrous Ajak killed many sets of twins along the way. After the Eternals restored Ajak to their true form, suddenly grief-stricken with the deeds that committed as a monster, Ajak committed [[suicide]], additionally disintegrating Dr. Damian himself.<ref>''Eternals: The Herod Factor'' #1</ref> Thena then send  Gilgamesh to help the Avengers, and  later helped this superhero group in the fight against Proctor and his Gatherers.<ref>''Avengers'' #374-375</ref>. Once again, Thena and the rest of  the Eternals had to fight Ghaur.<ref>''Heroes for Hire''(1997) #4-6</ref>, and then, Apocalypse.<ref>''The New Eternals: Apocalypse Now #1''(2000) #4-6</ref>\n\n=== Memory loss and Aftemath ===\nIn the 2006 ''Eternals'' title, Thena is married to Thomas Eliot, with a son, and is a researcher at [[Stark Enterprises]]. Like [[Sersi]] and [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], she was affected by [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]]'s reality warping to have no memory of her past as an Eternal.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Eternals|volume=3|issue=#1|writer=[[Neil Gaiman]]|artist=[[John Romita Jr.]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=August, 2006}}</ref>\n\nShe was released from a hostage situation by [[Iron Man]] in relation to the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event. Afterwards, she began to suffer terrible nightmares in which she was indeed immortal, and fought off various multicolored Deviants with ease. When she awoke from one of these dreams, she found she had gained back her costume and powers. She is then enlisted by [[Ikaris]] to help stop 'The [[Dreaming Celestial]]' from awaking in his sleeping place beneath Los Angeles.<ref>''Eternals''Vol. 3(2006) #3-5</ref>\n\nBy the end of the story, she remains one of the Eternals, keeping her (human) child with her in their home after a heated argument with Ikaris.<ref>''Eternals''Vol. 3(2006) #6</ref>\n\n=== Death===\nLater when the Celestials' Final Host arrived on Earth, Thena along with all the Eternals killed themselves after realizing the true purpose for which they were created.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 8) #4</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThena is a member of the race of superhumans known as the Eternals.
