He summoned a bunch of villains to him and gave them superpowers, and the villains became the Cadre. The Cadre has fought the Justice League on different occasions and has been through many incarnations of their group. Several members have died and new ones were recruited.The original Justice League defeated the Cadre, after which the Overmaster vanished. Years later, he returned, acting through heralds such as the Aryan Brigade, the New Extremists, and the Cadre of the Immortal.\n\n\n=== Cadre of the Immortal ===\nThere was also another version of the Cadre called the Cadre of the Immortal; this version was made up of international metahumans deluded by an agent of the Overmaster that claimed to be Prester John, the Immortal. He then announced his intention to destroy the Earth in one week, erasing Central City from the planet and stopping all deaths and births across the globe as proof of his power. The Justice League invaded the Overmaster\u2019s spacecraft and used its technology to reverse all effects of the Overmaster\u2019s activities. The Mahayogi was killed while freeing JLI member Maya from mind control. After the truth was revealed Seneca and Osiris joined the JLI in their battle against the Overmaster, but have not been seen in the DCU since.\nOvermaster was accidentally killed by Will Everett III, the second Amazing Man, after the Justice League member Ice had been killed by the villain. Following this event, the League moved into the Refuge, Overmaster\u2019s space station, making it their new headquarters.\n\n\n=== Second Cadre ===\nAnother version of the Cadre was formed with various members of minor DC villain groups such as the Extremists.\n\n\n=== Third Cadre ===\nYet another version of the Cadre, led by Doctor Polaris, was later formed and fought the Power Company.\n\n\n== Membership ==\nThere were different incarnations of the Cadre. They are:\n\n\n=== Members of Overmaster&#39;s Cadre ===\nOvermaster - A vaguely Galactus-like 580 million year-old alien.
