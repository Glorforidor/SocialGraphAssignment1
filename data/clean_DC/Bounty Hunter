                <span class="s2">&quot;extract&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Dial H for Hero is a comic book feature published by DC Comics about a magical dial that enables an ordinary person to become a superhero for a short time, such as an hour, by selecting the letters H-E-R-O in order. Each time it is used, the dial causes its possessor to become a superhero with a different name, costume, and powers. These superheroes are usually new, but on one occasion the dial caused its user to become a duplicate of Plastic Man. Some versions of the dial, like the original, contain additional letters, allowing other kinds of transformations. The title of the series is a play on the title of the 1954 American crime mystery film directed by Alfred Hitchcock titled Dial M for Murder.\n\n\n== Original series ==\n\nThe original series debuted in House of Mystery #156 (January 1966), and continued until issue #173 (March\u2013April 1968). The art was by Jim Mooney (though he did not finish the run), with scripts by Dave Wood.The original owner of the dial is Robert \&quot;Robby\&quot; Reed, a highly intelligent teenager with a penchant for exclaiming \&quot;Sockamagee!\&quot; He lives in the fictional town of Littleville, Colorado with his grandfather \&quot;Gramps\&quot; Reed and their housekeeper Miss Millie. During a camping trip, Robby accidentally falls into a cavern and discovers the dial in one of its alcoves. The origins of the dial and how it came to be in the cavern are never revealed.Resembling a rotary telephone dial, the device is hand-held with unknown symbols inside the dial&#39;s finger- openings and along its outer rim, which Robby deciphers into modern English letters. In Mark Waid&#39;s \&quot;Silver Age\&quot; mini-series, it is revealed that the symbols on the dial are Interlac. Each time he dials the letters H-E-R-O, Robby transforms into a different super-powered being; dialing O-R-E-H reverts him to his normal form. Robby soon uses the dial to protect Littleville under the guises of numerous superheroes.The wide array of Robby&#39;s superhero identities included the Squid, Quake-Master, King Coil, Hornet-Man, Shadow-Man, Mighty Moppet, King Kandy, Future-Man, Human Bullet, Super-Charge, the Mole, Mr. Echo, Hypno-Man, the Cometeer and the Human Starfish, among others.The H-Dial came with certain limitations. Typically, Robby could transform from one hero to another immediately, but occasionally he would have to wait an unspecified length of time after being one hero before using the dial again to become another. In House of Mystery #165, a \&quot;freak electrical storm\&quot; in space affects his H-Dial, changing him temporarily into oddly-shaped \&quot;freak\&quot; super-heroes dubbed \&quot;Whoozis\&quot;, \&quot;Whatsis\&quot;, and \&quot;Howzis\&quot;. In House of Mystery #173, certain high-pitched frequencies from a villain&#39;s supersonic motor affect Robby&#39;s hero forms, causing them to rob the criminals and keep the loot for themselves. Only after the motor is destroyed does Robby realize what is happening to him, enabling him to recover the stolen items.\nRobby&#39;s H-Dial could also be used by others, transforming them into unique superhuman forms. The dial was once used by Robby&#39;s adversary Daffy Dagan in House of Mystery #158 (April 1966)- he briefly became a supervillain known as Daffy the Great after dialing V-I-L-L-A-I-N. In House of Mystery #169 (September 1967), Robby&#39;s girlfriend Suzie discovers Robby&#39;s secret and dialed H-E-R-O-I-N-E to temporarily transform into Gem Girl in order to help defeat Toymaster. At the end of the story, Suzie receives a blow to the head that causes her to forget about the secret of the device.\nWith issue #174, editor Joe Orlando dropped \&quot;Dial H for Hero\&quot; and \&quot;Manhunter from Mars\&quot; as regular features in House of Mystery, changing the comic to an anthology of horror-themed short stories.After the series ceased its run in House of Mystery, Robby appeared in Plastic Man #13 (June\u2013July 1976). Recovering from an attack of amnesia, Robby retrieves his dial which has become corroded with rust. The corrosion causes Robby to turn into an evil version of Plastic Man and he attacks the real Plastic Man. After defeating Robby and returning him to normal, Plastic Man confiscates the dial from Robby for using it irresponsibly. It is never explained how Robby is seen with the dial in later stories.\n\n\n== 1980s series ==\n\nThe second Dial H for Hero series debuted in the 1980s, in a special insert in Legion of Super-Heroes #272 (February 1981), then ran in Adventure Comics #479\u2013490 and continued in New Adventures of Superboy #28\u201349; the duo also appeared alongside Superman in DC Comics Presents #44. A new feature of this series was that the readers could submit new hero and villain characters, which were then used in the stories. The submitters were given credit for their creations (and a T-shirt with the series logo), but the characters became DC Comics&#39; property. Some, however, only made cameo one-panel appearances. The original writer and artist in the series were Marv Wolfman and Carmine Infantino.\nIn this series, two other dials are discovered years later by teenagers Christopher \&quot;Chris\&quot; King and Victoria \&quot;Vicki\&quot; Grant of the New England town of Fairfax in a \&quot;haunted house\&quot;. These dials \u2014 disguised as a watch and a necklace \u2014 only have the letters H-E-R-O on them, and work only for an hour, after which they will not work for another hour. King and Grant begin protecting Fairfax from a number of menaces. Unknown to them, most of these villains are created by a mysterious villain known only as The Master (who is obsessed with the H-dials for reasons unknown for most of the series) who creates them from the cell samples of unknown people.While anyone could use Chris and Vicki&#39;s H-dials, they always turned the user into a hero, regardless of his or her personality; even The Master was temporarily made good by one. This fact has been ignored in later stories. On one occasion, a hero&#39;s persona overwhelmed the heroic Chris&#39; own personality; as \&quot;Ragnarok, the Cosmic Viking\&quot;, he possessed no awareness of Chris King&#39;s memories and acted with disregard for others&#39; property and safety, going so far as to threaten police officers and swat away Vicki (as the miniature heroine \&quot;Pixie\&quot;) when she attempted to talk him down, failing to recognize her as an ally. On a side note, it was a matter of contention with Chris when he first started using the dial that while Vicki changed into useful heroes with applicable powers, Chris&#39;s powers tended to be obscure and not particularly useful to defeat his opponent, such as when he changed into a super hero that could duplicate things and he outright began complaining about his useless ability. Indeed, it was that issue where Vicki showed Chris to think \&quot;outside the box\&quot; and use his temporary gifts creatively so they could be useful, at which point he helped defeat that issue&#39;s bad guy. Once this lesson was learned, Chris&#39;s super-hero changes became more relevant to the situation, but no explanation was given as to why this was.\nEventually Chris and Vicki discover that a fellow student named Nick Stevens has been drawing up superheroes as a hobby \u2014 and somehow, the dials turn them into those heroes. With Nick&#39;s help, they find out that their dials were created by a being called The Wizard (not to be confused with the DC Comics villain of the same name), whom the Master thought he&#39;d killed years before. In truth, The Wizard faked his death while he looked for the original Hero Dial. With it, he merges with The Master \u2014 and transforms into Robby Reed, who explains that years before, he had used the dial to split in two (dialing \&quot;S P L I T\&quot;) so that he could disarm a dead man&#39;s switch, while his other self, the Wizard, defeated the villain who set it. However, the Wizard carried all of Robby&#39;s inherent goodness, while the Robby that remained possessed only evil impulses; the original Hero Dial was lost when this Robby, renaming himself The Master, dialed \&quot;hide yourself\&quot;, causing the dial to vanish along with The Master&#39;s and The Wizard&#39;s memories of their former life as Robby Reed. While The Master learned genetic techniques that allowed him to create his army of super-villains, the Wizard was driven to create the new H-dials, unconsciously designing limitations into them to prevent what happened to Robby from recurring (only heroic identities, a time limit, and the exclusion of letters other than H-E-R-O; the latter, however, did not prevent Chris from experimenting on one occasion and dialing H-O-R-R-O-R, with disastrous results). With Nick developing the ability to actively influence the dials&#39; results (rather than subconsciously as before), Robby passes his dial to Nick, and retires as a hero.In New Teen Titans #45 (June 1988), Victoria and Chris&#39; history after the end of their series is revealed. After the two teens graduated from high school, they found they had gained the ability to transform without the dials \u2014 apparently because of their extensive use \u2014 but as a side-effect Vicki began experiencing mental problems. Vicki later joined a cult called the Children of the Sun, where she was physically and mentally abused, deranging her even more. She sought out her former partner Chris in order to kill him. With help from the Teen Titans, Chris rescued her (in New Teen Titans #46). Chris now finds that he changes into a new superhero every hour, without the dial, and remains that way until he expends an unspecified amount of energy. He decides to continue his superhero career, using a suit provided by S.T.A.R. Labs to monitor his changes.\nIn Superboy and the Ravers #5 (January 1997), Hero Cruz finds Vicki&#39;s H-dial in the lair of Scavenger, and uses it to gain superpowers. A still deranged Vicki returns in Superboy and the Ravers #13 (September 1997) to get her dial back from Hero, but she regains her sanity once she uses the device. She is last seen in the care of the Forces, a family of metahumans.\n\n\n== Silver Age event ==\nDuring the 2000 Silver Age cross-over event, Robby encountered his old House of Mystery co-star Martian Manhunter, in Silver Age: Dial H for Hero #1. Believing that he and the rest of the Justice League had gone bad, Robby turns into a superhero to stop him. Actually, Martian Manhunter has been mind-swapped with Dr. Light (the other Justice League have undergone similar mental transpositions, but those seen here are only Light&#39;s illusions). Subsequently, in Silver Age 80-Page Giant #1 (July 2000), Robby lends the H-Dial to the now mind/body restored Justice League, allowing several of its members to transform themselves into new superheroes to defeat Agamemno&#39;s Injustice League at a time when they had learned how to defeat the Justice League members in their normal forms:\n\nSuperman becomes Doc Fission\nBatman becomes Minuteman\nFlash becomes Marionette\nAtom becomes Mod-Man\nBlack Canary becomes Miss Fortune\nAquaman becomes Terra-Firma\nGreen Arrow becomes Poltergeist\nMartian Manhunter becomes Go-Go.In these new forms, the Justice League were able to defeat the Injustice League.\n\n\n== 2003 series ==\n\nDC relaunched the series again in 2003, this time simply titled H.E.R.O.. The new series, written by Will Pfeifer with art by Kano, focused on the effect the H-Dial has on a series of average people, whose lives are usually ruined by the pressures of superherodom. Robby Reed, now grown old and bitter, is searching for the missing dial, determined to retrieve it and keep a serial killer from getting his hands on it. The series lasted 22 issues with it ending with the H-Dial&#39;s powers internalized into Robby Reed and some other people who have come across it after the serial killer that was using it was stopped. The H-Dial ends up being sent back in time to 50,000 BC. Superman is featured in one of the stories.\n\n\n== 2012 series ==\n\nFor the The New 52 initiative, DC began publishing a reboot of the series titled Dial H, written by China Mi\u00e9ville with art by Mateus Santolouco. The series focuses on Nelson Jent, an out-of-shape, unemployed middle-age man who accesses superpowers by dialing seemingly random numbers in an old phone booth. Another main character is an older woman named Roxie Hodder who takes the identity of \&quot;Manteau\&quot; regardless of what powers the dial calls up and acts as an advisor to Nelson. Following the fight against Ex Nihilo and Abyss, Nelson and Roxie work to figure out the secrets of the H-Dials.\nLater issues of the series introduces the S-Dial which turns anyone who uses it into a superhero sidekick to match the person&#39;s superhero form.\nWhen it comes to Nelson and Roxie&#39;s encounter with the Fixer (who is associated with the different dials), both of them have an encounter with a group of superheroes called the Dial Bunch who have fought the Fixer before. There is also an introduction to the J-Dial (which enables the user to jump through worlds), the G-Dial (which can summon any technological gadget), the Dial-Tapper (which can copy any H-Dial in range), and the Auto-Dialer.\nTo tie-in with DC&#39;s Villain&#39;s Month event, DC published Justice League #23.3: Dial E, a coda to the series. It featured the Q-Dial in which a person must be evil to use it. The Q in Q-Dial is for \&quot;Qued\&quot; which is an old word for bad.\n\n\n== 2019 series ==\nA Dial H for Hero limited series was launched as part of the Wonder Comics imprint for younger readers, starring new protagonists Miguel Montez and Summer Pickens. The series was written by Sam Humphries and drawn by Joe Quinones. Issue #1 was released on March 27, 2019. Originally intended for a six-issue run, Dial H For Hero was extended to a total of 12 issues along with its fellow Wonder Comics limited series Wonder Twins. The final issue was released on February 26, 2020.\nMiguel and Summer are teenagers living in the small town of Devil&#39;s Canyon, California. Miguel is an orphan who works in his uncle Brant&#39;s mayonnaise-themed food truck, and has engaged in daredevil stunts ever since he was saved by Superman from a near-death experience at age 10. Summer is a frequent runaway with a troubled home life. The H-Dial manifests itself in front of Miguel during a bicycle stunt gone wrong as he is plummeting into the canyon \u2013 dialling \&quot;H\&quot; for \&quot;Hero\&quot;, Miguel is turned into a superhero called Monster Truck. When Miguel comes to and finds that he has trashed a car dealership, Summer arrives in Uncle Brant&#39;s stolen food truck and the two flee town together along with the H-Dial. \nVia the H-Dial, Miguel and Summer are in contact with a mysterious elderly man known as the Operator, who is soon revealed to be Robby Reed. Meanwhile, it also transpires that there are thousands of former users of the H-Dial across the country, many of whom are desperate for another chance to get superpowers \u2013 the mysterious villain Mister Thunderbolt has recruited many into his Thunderbolt Club and sent them to take the H-Dial. After being targeted by two Thunderbolt Club members, Miguel and Summer resolve to travel across the country to Metropolis and give the H-Dial to Superman as the only person they trust not to misuse it. It is later revealed that the Thunderbolt Club are in pursuit of four hero-dials, named in reference to the CMYK color model for printing: in addition to the magenta M-Dial that appeared before Miguel, there is the cyan C-Dial, the yellow Y-Dial and the black K-Dial, each with different functions. \nSnapper Carr appears in the series as a recurring supporting character, being identified as a past user of the H-Dial. Issue #10 shows Miguel and Summer travelling through various realities in the DC multiverse, including an extended sequence on Earth-32 where every superhero is an amalgam of two main-universe heroes (e.g. Super-Martian, Bat Lantern, Wonder Hawk). Issue #11 is primarily set on the planet Apokolips, and features extended homages to the Reign of the Supermen and Superman Red/Superman Blue storylines. The series also contains many other homages to significant works in comic books and manga through its shifting art style and the identities of various heroes summoned by the H-Dial. These include Dragon Ball, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, various Vertigo Comics titles, and the works of Mike Allred, Rob Liefeld, Moebius, Frank Miller, Chris Ware and others. The series also examines the concept of a superhero&#39;s \&quot;secret origin\&quot;, identifying it not as the moment where they acquired superpowers but instead as the moment of their decision to use their powers to do good.  \nFollowing the conclusion of the limited series, Miguel and Summer made appearances in the Wonder Comics series Young Justice.\n\n\n== Other appearances ==\nAs an epilogue to the Chris King/Vicki Grant Dial H series, The New Adventures of Superboy #50 features a story in which Chris King&#39;s watch is stolen from the Space Museum of the Legion of Super-Heroes&#39; time period by a thief named Nylor Truggs, who flees with the dial to the ambiguous late 1960s/early 1970s era-Smallville of the original (Earth-One) Superboy by altering the dial&#39;s functions in some unexplained manner, allowing him to travel in time. Truggs further alters the H-dial to break the restriction that users can only transform into heroic identities, changing the \&quot;H\&quot; in the center of the dial to \&quot;V\&quot; for \&quot;villain\&quot;. Truggs also makes the dial capable of changing individuals other than himself into villains if he desires; those transformed would then be under Truggs&#39; control. Truggs transforms several of Clark Kent&#39;s high school friends, and forms a temporary alliance with a teenaged Lex Luthor, in a scheme to plant seismic devices in their time period so that Truggs can use those devices against the people of his own future time upon his return. Truggs&#39; plan is foiled by Superboy, several members of the Legion, and Krypto the Superdog, the latter of which destroys the stolen H-Dial by crushing it in his jaws. Vicki Grant&#39;s H-Dial is also shown to have survived to the Legion&#39;s time\u2014it is slated to replace King&#39;s dial in the museum display. As this story was published before the events of the Crisis on Infinite Earths (which erased the Earth-One Superboy from continuity) and the subsequent rebootings of the Legion of Super-Heroes&#39; history, it is unlikely that any elements of this story exist in current continuity.\nIn Legionnaires #69, Lori Morning uses an H-dial that was given to her by the Time Trapper to gain superpowers, and becomes a member of Workforce. Lori gives the H-dial to Brainiac 5.1 to use against the Rift; the device is destroyed in the process. This timeline was also erased in the Legion reboot.\nIn a One Year Later storyline, the H-Dial comes into the possession of Father Time, who hopes to clone the device and create an entire army of \&quot;one man Justice Leagues\&quot;. However the device is stolen, and Johnny Mimic (the reformed Green Lantern villain called to act as a profiler) dupes Alan Scott into killing him while holding the device, destroying it for good.\nIn The Brave and the Bold #9 (February 2008), Robby Reed teamed up with the Metal Men, even lending the dial to Tin to allow him to transform into a more resilient superhero to defeat the monster conjured by the deranged alchemist Megistus. The dial, due to its transformative abilities, bore an optional part in Megistus&#39; plans to draw the storm that brought about the genesis of Red Kryptonite upon Earth, warping it as to protect it from the events of the Final Crisis. Dial H appeared again in issue #27 of the same series, this time in a team-up with Batman. While staying at a hotel in Gotham City, Robby uses the dial to see the future however realizing that something will kill him  while using the dial he decided to let the dial be stolen by a down on his luck young man named Travers Milton. After using the Dial to transform into a Superman-esque flying hero named the Star, Travers assists Batman in defending Gotham after the Joker arranges a series of violent crimes to be committed throughout the city in order to break Batman. After discovering that the final challenge for Batman is a remote-controlled bomb placed over a group of bound and gagged men and women, Travers heroically sacrifices his life by flying out into the night sky while clutching the bomb, saving Batman and the hostages seconds before it detonates. Afterwards, Batman returns the H-Dial to Robby who refused it because even though it prevents his eventual fate he didn&#39;t want to let it affect to anyone else  but Batman tells him that it gave Travers what he had always wanted; the chance to be a hero that Robby will do the same thing. There is no indication given as to where either of the \&quot;Brave &amp; the Bold\&quot; stories fit into Robby Reed&#39;s personal timeline however.\nIn JLA: Another Nail, the H-Dial made a brief appearance when all time periods meld together. A hand can be seen barely clutching it.\nIn the \&quot;Watchmen\&quot; sequel \&quot;Doomsday Clock\&quot;, Robby Reed&#39;s Human Starfish form is among the superheroes that confront Doctor Manhattan on Mars.\n\n\n== Hero forms ==\n\n\n=== Robby Reed ===\nGiantboy \u2013 A giant hero with super-strength and flight.
