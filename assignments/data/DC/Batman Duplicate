The score of the series was influenced by Elfman's work on the Burton films, as well as music of 1940s film noir.\n\nThe series is more adult-oriented than many of the previous superhero cartoons. It depicts outright physical violence against antagonists, including realistic firearms (though only one character, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], was even depicted as having been shot, in the episode \"I Am the Night\"). First-time producers Timm and Radomski reportedly encountered resistance from studio executives, but the success of Burton's first film allowed the embryonic series to survive long enough to produce a pilot episode, \"[[On Leather Wings]]\", which, according to Timm, \"got a lot of people off our backs\".&lt;ref name=\"LeatherWingsComm\"/> During the series' production, producer [[Alan Burnett]] wrote a silent episode (without dialogue) entitled \"Silent Night\" to explore more of Batman's sexual life, but this was never produced. Burnett also intended to make an episode featuring a [[Nocturna (DC Comics)|female vampire]] that would bite Batman to suck his blood, but plans never materialized.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/interviews/burnett.php|title=The World's Finest - Batman: The Animated Series|website=www.worldsfinestonline.com}}&lt;/ref>\n\nThe series is also notable for its supporting cast\u2014numerous known actors provided voices for a variety of recognizable villains, most notably [[Mark Hamill]] (previously famous for his role as [[Luke Skywalker]] in the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy) finding success in voice acting thanks to his \"cheerfully deranged\" portrayal of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].&lt;ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/kubin2.1.html | title = An Interview With Mark Hamill | accessdate =October 14, 2007| publisher = Animation World Magazine| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221837/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/kubin2.1.html| archivedate= October 12, 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref> The role was originally given to [[Tim Curry]], but he developed [[bronchitis]] during the initial recording sessions.&lt;ref>{{cite web|last=Lis|first=Martin|url=http://www.screengeek.net/2017/09/02/tim-curry-reveals-why-mark-hamill-replaced-him-as-joker/|title=Exclusive: Tim Curry Reveals Why Mark Hamill Replaced Him as JOKER|publisher=ScreenGeek|date=September 2, 2017|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref> [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]], who later voiced the Riddler, also auditioned for the Joker role. Hamill, who found himself to be the biggest fan of the Batman comics among the cast, credited the laughs he had honed on stage in ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'' with landing him the role.&lt;ref name=\"HR25\" /> The recording sessions, under the supervision of voice director [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]], were recorded with the actors together in one studio instead of taking separate recordings, as is typical. This method would later be employed for all subsequent series in the [[DC animated universe]]. [[Al Pacino]] was considered to voice [[Two-Face]] in the series, but he declined the offer.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://about-faces.livejournal.com/68401.html|title=The Origins of (the Origins of) Harvey Dent in \"Batman: The Animated Series\"|first=2012-01-24 16:40:00 About_faces About_faces 2012-01-24 16:40:00|last=About_faceswrote|publisher=}}&lt;/ref> [[Richard Moll]] was instead cast in the role. Other actors included [[Ron Perlman]] as [[Clayface]], [[Roddy McDowall]] as the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as [[Ra's al Ghul]], [[Michael York]] as [[Count Vertigo]], [[Kate Mulgrew]] as Red Claw, [[George Murdock (actor)|George Murdock]] as [[List of DC Comics characters: B|Boss Biggis]] and [[George Dzundza]] as the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]].\n\nOne of the series' best-known inventions is the Joker's assistant, [[Harley Quinn]], who became so popular that DC Comics later added her to mainstream Batman comic book continuity. [[Penguin (character)|The Penguin]] underwent change for the series; his appearance was remodeled after the version seen in ''[[Batman Returns]]'', which was in production simultaneously with the series' first season. New life was also given to lesser-known characters for the series such as the [[Clock King]]. In addition, dramatic changes were made to other villains such as [[Clayface]] and [[Mr. Freeze]], who was changed from a gimmicky [[mad scientist]] to a [[tragedy|tragic]] figure whose \"frigid exterior [hid] a doomed love and vindictive fury\".\n\n==Characters==\n\nThe [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s accomplice [[Harley Quinn]], Gotham City police detective [[Renee Montoya]], the vigilante [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]], former actor Simon Trent, and ninja Kyodai Ken are original creations who became characters in the comics. Older villains that were lesser known from the comics, such as [[Count Vertigo]], the [[Weasand (comics)|Mirror Man]] and the [[Clock King]], were modified for the series in both appearance and personality.\n\nAside from creating characters that crossed over into the main line of DC Comics, several of the series' reinterpretations were carried over as well. [[Mr. Freeze]] was revised in the comics to emulate the series' tragic story, the success of which actually compelled DC to bring the character back after \"killing\" him off some years earlier. [[Clayface]] was revised to be much more similar in appearance to his animated counterpart; and Two-Face's double-sided, black-and-white suit has become a common appearance for the character.\n\n===Bruce Wayne/Batman===\n[[File:Batmananimated32.png|thumb|upright|Batman as depicted in the series.]]\nAt the age of eight, Bruce Wayne, the son of billionaire philanthropists, witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha, during a mugging on the street. The event left him traumatized and mentally scarred for the rest of his life. This left Bruce to be cared for by his family's butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Over the years, Bruce slowly turned the pain and trauma he sustained into a burning fuel for a lifelong obsession, as he underwent rigorous training in mental and physical conditioning, the martial arts, criminology, sciences, manhunting, forensics, detective work, interrogation methods and intimidation, for the next years of his life. Having observed the rampant crime and corruption across Gotham City, he chose to deal with the crime-wave in Gotham in his own way, by utilizing his years of training and swore an oath to dedicate his entire life to fighting crime, in a bid to avenge the murder of his parents and to use his pain and suffering to drive him to do good, while being guided by his self-enforced moral code to never kill and to refrain from utilizing firearms. Inspired by the presence of bats, his childhood fear, which used to present around his home, Bruce chose to undertake the alias of The [https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/batman/ Batman], a feared, near-mythical and bat-masked vigilante.\n\nOne of the most notable changes made in ''The Animated Series'' is the treatment of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne. In nearly all other media, including the comics, television shows and films, Bruce deliberately plays up his image as a vacuous, self-absorbed and not-too-bright billionaire playboy.&lt;ref name=\"fbf\">[http://www.factbehindfiction.com/index_files/brucewayne.htm Fact Behind Fiction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628045507/http://www.factbehindfiction.com/index_files/brucewayne.htm |date=June 28, 2016 }}, Bruce Wayne biography.&lt;/ref> In ''The Animated Series'', his character is assertive, outwardly intelligent, and actively involved in the management of [[Wayne Enterprises]], without jeopardizing his secret identity. For example: in the episode \"Eternal Youth\", Bruce is shown angrily ordering one of his directors to cancel a deal with a timber company in the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]] rainforest that had been made behind his back, threatening him with termination upon failure to comply.\n\n[[Kevin Conroy]] used different voices to distinguish between his portrayal of Bruce Wayne and Batman, a tactic used previously by [[Michael Keaton]] in [[Tim Burton]]'s live-action films.&lt;ref name=\"Murphy\">{{cite web |last=Murphy |first=Joel |date=October 1, 2009 |title=One on One with Kevin Conroy |publisher=HoboTrashcan |url=http://www.hobotrashcan.com/2009/10/01/one-on-one-with-kevin-conroy}}&lt;/ref> Conroy based his dual-voice performance on the [[The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934 film)|1934 film adaptation of ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'']].&lt;ref name=\"HR25\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-animated-series-hirings-firings-last-minute-changes-1035120|title='Batman' at 25: Hirings, Firings and Other Last-Minute Changes Behind the Animated Classic|magazine=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 5, 2017|accessdate=July 17, 2018|author=Burton, Byron and Couch, Aaron}}&lt;/ref>\n\n===Dick Grayson===\nThe story of [https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/nightwing/ Dick Grayson] began at a circus. Growing up, Dick was a circus performer. He traveled the country with his mother, Mary, and father, John, performing acts as \"the Flying Graysons,\" a world-famous trapeze troupe that performed with Haly's Circus. Eventually, things turned for the worst. The circus was set to perform in Gotham and was setting up when a mobster named [[Tony Zucco]] went up to Mr. Haly and attempted to extort him in exchange for protection money. When Haly refused to pay, Zucco retaliated by having his thugs sabotage the circus's trapeze with acid. At this time John and Mary were set to begin their act. In the middle of their performance, the tampered wires snapped and sent them plummeting to their deaths right before Dick's eyes. Bruce Wayne happened to be in attendance to witness the incident and quickly sprung into action as Batman during the chaos. Having had the experience and trauma of being suddenly, violently orphaned, Bruce decided to take Dick under his wing so they could set about avenging the Graysons' murders. After a series of intense training, Dick began making a costume and a Superhero identity for himself. Getting inspiration from his mother's favorite bird and his favorite folktale hero, Robin Hood, Dick chose the name \"[https://www.dcuniverse.com/encyclopedia/nightwing/ Robin]\", and he officially became Batman's sidekick, thus creating the Dynamic Duo.\n\nThe series also redefined the original [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Dick Grayson]]. While much of Dick's past remains the same, his Robin costume is modernized with short sleeves and long [[tights]], exactly like [[Tim Drake]]'s original Robin outfit but with a non-italicized \"R\" symbol. In addition, Dick is given a more serious and mature personality to match the tone of the series. The episode \"Batgirl Returns\" establishes that Dick and [[Barbara Gordon]] attend the same college and that they have a mutual romantic attraction to each other, but neither one knows the secret identity of the other. Their relationship is one of the plot elements of the film ''[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]''.\n\n=== Barbara Gordon ===\nBarbara Gordon is first seen in the two-parter \"Heart of Steel\", where she becomes convinced her father is an imposter.  She makes her first appearance as alter ego Batgirl in \"Shadow of the Bat\", after her father Commissioner Gordon is arrested under charges of corruption. Her Batgirl costume is exactly the same from ''The Adventures of Batman'' and the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age of comics]], sporting the same gray bodysuit, blue cape and cowl and yellow bat-symbol and utility belt, but with blue gloves and boots to mirror that of Batman's costume instead of yellow ones. She makes several appearances throughout the series, and attends the same university as Dick Grayson, though neither of them are aware of each other's crime fighting alter ego. In \"Batgirl Returns\", Barbara actually makes a cease fire deal with Catwoman, and they work together in solving the case of missing valuable cat statues while Batman is away.  All of Barbara's/Batgirl's appearances are in episodes written by [[Brynne Stephens]].\n\n=== The Joker ===\nThough the Joker's origin is never shown in the series, some of his past is seen in the feature film ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]''. In flashbacks, he is shown before his accident but is not referred to by name. His potential real name, '''Jack Napier''' (the same name of [[Joker (Jack Napier)|Jack Nicholson\u2019s version of the character]]), is established in the episodes \"Dreams in Darkness\" when it is spoken by Dr. Bartholomew and in \"Joker's Wild\" where it is written in a dossier. However, it is stated on a later occasion that the Joker used many aliases throughout his career, meaning his true identity is still unknown.\n\nThe man who would become the Joker started out as a chauffeur and hitman for the mob triad of Salvatore Valestra, Buzz Bronski and Chuckie Sol. Twice on separate occasions, he saw Bruce Wayne and exchanged glances years before they would clash as the Joker and Batman. Years later, after the Valestra Mob had gone their separate ways, the pre-Joker struck out on his own and formed a small gang. The night he and his gang broke into the ACE Chemical Plant marked the first time he encountered Batman. During their fight, the pre-Joker fell off a catwalk and into a drainage vat of chemicals. He was washed out into the bay and discovered the chemicals bleached his skin chalk white, dyed his hair green, stained his lips red, leaving them in a permanent rictus smile, and dyed his suit purple. This new, clown-like appearance snapped his already sadistic mind and drove him to eternal insanity. He reinvented himself as the Joker, Batman's greatest enemy and Gotham City's most dangerous costumed criminal.\n\nThe use of this origin was due to the show being heavily patterned after the success and influential tone of ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. However, when ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' began, during the era of [[Joel Schumacher]]'s films, Joker's origin was retained but his identity was retconned as being merely one of many aliases as seen in the series finale \"Beware the Creeper\". This reflected the efforts of the writers to put the character back in line with his conflicting multiple origins from the comics.\n\n===Other characters===\n[[Image:BTASVillains.jpg|thumb|350px|Batman's [[List of Batman Family enemies|rogues gallery]] from left to right: [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], the [[Riddler]], [[Catwoman]] (and her cat Isis) and [[Two-Face]].]]\nOther antagonists that appeared in the series included classic villain such as [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Catwoman]], the [[Riddler]], [[Two-Face]], the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Ra's al Ghul]], [[Talia al Ghul]], [[Man-Bat]], the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Killer Croc]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist and his dummy Scarface]], [[Hugo Strange]] and [[Tony Zucco]].

Animation]] outsourced the series to several different overseas animation houses: [[Spectrum Animation]], [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]], Studio Junio and Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]) in Japan, [[Dong Yang Animation]], [[CNK International|Koko Enterprises Ltd.]] and [[AKOM]] in South Korea, [[TVB|Jade Animation]] in Hong Kong, Blue Pencil in Spain and Network of Animation (NOA) in Canada.&lt;ref name=\"BTASFilmography\">[http://anbat.toonzone.net/btas/filmography.html/ ''Batman: The Animated Series'' - Filmography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105073924/http://anbat.toonzone.net/btas/filmography.html/ |date=November 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref> TMS also animated the first season's opening theme sequence. AKOM was eventually fired due to its inconsistent animation in many episodes such as \"Cat Scratch Fever\" and \"Moon of the Wolf\".&lt;ref>{{cite magazine |last=Kindred |first=Christopher |date=June 1993 |title=Batman: The Animated Series - Cat Scratch Fever |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/batman/btas/backstage/animato/ |magazine=Animato! |publisher=Ventrella |access-date=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref>\n\nThe 20 episodes of the second season were animated largely by Dong Yang, with the exception of three done by Studio Junio (\"A Bullet for Bullock\", \"Avatar\" and \"Baby-Doll\") and one done by Jade Animation (\"The Terrible Trio\").&lt;ref name=\"BTASFilmography\" />\n\nOn the commentary track for \"[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series episode)|Heart of Ice]]\" on the ''Batman: The Animated Series, Volume One'' [[DVD-Video|DVD]], producer Bruce Timm stated that Spectrum was responsible for airbrushing Mr. Freeze's helmet in every frame that featured him. Such attention to detail ultimately drove the studio to bankruptcy; most of their staff members are now working for [[Production I.G]].&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpectrumAnimation |title=Spectrum Animation (Creator) - TV Tropes |publisher=TV Tropes |date=2012-10-25 |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref>\n\n===Adaptations===\nThe show also featured numerous adaptations of various Batman comics stories. The following episodes were adaptations:\n\n* The episode \"Appointment in Crime Alley\" is based on \"There Is No Hope in Crime Alley\" from ''Detective Comics #457'' (March 1976) by writer [[Denny O'Neil]] and artist [[Dick Giordano]].\n* \"Dreams in Darkness\" is loosely based on \"[[Batman: The Last Arkham]]\" from ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #1\u20134 by writer [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and artist [[Norm Breyfogle]] (June\u2013September, 1992). This episode adapted the comic book story with the inclusion of [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] instead of [[Victor Zsasz]] and Dr. Bartholomew instead of [[Jeremiah Arkham]].\n* \"The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy\" was an adaptation of \"The Cape and Cowl Death Trap!\" from ''[[Detective Comics]] #450'' (August 1975), written by [[Elliot S. Maggin]] and drawn by artist [[Walt Simonson]].\n* Part 1 of \"[[Robin's Reckoning]]\" takes its cues from \"Batman and \"Robin the Boy Wonder\"\" in ''Detective Comics #38'' (April 1940) by writer [[Bill Finger]], artist [[Bob Kane]] and illustrator [[Jerry Robinson]].\n* The episode \"The Laughing Fish\" was based on three Batman comics, blended together; \"The Joker's Five-Way Revenge\" from ''Batman'' #251 (September 1973) by [[Denny O'Neil]] with art by [[Neal Adams]], followed by \"The Laughing Fish\" and \"Sign of the Joker!\" from ''Detective Comics'' #475 and #476, of (February\u2013March 1978), both by writer [[Steve Englehart]] with art by [[Marshall Rogers]]. During a spotlight podcast from [[San Diego Comic-Con|Comic-Con]] 2007, [[Paul Dini]] explained that the reason why the episode combined those stories was that the show's creators could not adapt them separately, because their content and thematic elements would not have been cleared by the censors.\n* \"The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne\" was based on the comic stories \"The Dead Yet Live\" and \"I Am the Batman!\" from ''Detective Comics'' #471 and #472 (August\u2013September 1977) by [[Steve Englehart]].\n* \"Moon of the Wolf\" is based on the comic story of the same name by writer [[Len Wein]] with art by [[Neal Adams]], from ''Batman #255'' (April 1974).\n* The episode \"Terror in the Sky\" is loosely based on \"Man-Bat Over Vegas\", originally presented in ''Detective Comics #429'', by writer and artist [[Frank Robbins]]. The setting has been shifted from [[Las Vegas]] to Gotham Harbor, and in keeping with the family-friendly rating of the television show, She-Bat is not a vampire in the adaptation. The final line of the episode, \"the nightmare's finally over\", is similar to one of the final lines from the original comic, \"Now Fran's vampire nightmare is about over\".\n* The episode \"Almost Got 'Im\" appears to be influenced by a four-issue story arc in Batman #291\u2013294 (1977), entitled \"Where Were You on the Night Batman Was Killed?\".  All four stories were written by [[David Vern Reed]] and drawn by [[John Calnan]] under the direction of Batman editor [[Julius Schwartz]]. In each of the four issues, one of Catwoman, The Riddler, and The Joker all recount their claims to have killed Batman. However, the plot for \"Almost Got 'Im\" is quite different (six stories in the show, and four completely different ones in the comic book), with only the Joker as an overlapping antagonist.\n** Two-Face's strategy in \"Almost Got 'Im\" (strapping down Batman to a giant coin and flipping the coin in the air) was taken from the comic; ''World's Finest Comics #30'' (September 1947) by writer [[Bill Finger]] and artist [[Bob Kane]]. In a backup tale, both Batman and Robin were tied to a giant penny that was catapulted onto spikes by a lesser-known villain the [[Penny Plunderer]].\n* \"Off Balance\" is a direct adaptation of \"Batman: Into the Den of the Death-Dealers\" from ''Detective Comics'' #411, (May 1971) written by writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and drawn by artists Bob Brown and [[Dick Giordano]]. Famous for the first appearance of the mysterious [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]] character.\n* The two-part episode \"The Demon's Quest\" is a direct adaptation of \"Daughter of the Demon\" from ''Batman'' #232, (June 1971), and \"The Demon Lives Again\" ''Batman'' #244 (September 1972), written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and drawn by artist [[Neal Adams]]. Famous for introducing one of Batman's deadlier foes; [[Ra's al Ghul]], father of Talia.\n* The episode \"Sideshow\" is loosely based on \"A Vow From the Grave\" from ''Detective Comics #410'' by writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artists Bob Brown and [[Dick Giordano]]. This episode adapted the comic book story with the inclusion of a separate [[Killer Croc]] story.\n* \"A Bullet for Bullock\" is based on the comic of the same name from ''Detective Comics #651'' (October 1992), by writer [[Chuck Dixon]] and artist [[Graham Nolan]].\n* The [[feature film]] ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm|Mask of the Phantasm]]'' is also an adaptation. The film's flashbacks were inspired by \"[[Batman: Year One]]\", whereas the character of [[Andrea Beaumont]] and the storyline itself were modified from Mike Barr's story \"[[Batman: Year Two]]\", which ran in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #575\u2013578 in the late 1980s; the villain in the comics was named [[Reaper (DC Comics)|The Reaper]].&lt;ref name=\"HBO\">HBO. \"HBO First Look: ''Batman Mask of the Phantasm''.\" HBO (c. 1993).

These segments are intended to be interspersed between gameplay elements of an early-1990s video game and as such, the sound, color and story are not quite of the same quality of the actual television program. And because Sega did not have to follow the censorship rules of the show, the fights are also a little more violent. Many of the shows voice actors reprised their roles for the game, and are thus in the lost episode as well. Similar cutscenes appear throughout the video games ''[[Batman: Vengeance]]'' and ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]''.&lt;ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonamiarsenal.com/features/lostbatman/ |title=Batman: The Lost \"Episode\" |publisher=Toonamiarsenal.com |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722000700/http://www.toonamiarsenal.com/features/lostbatman/ |archive-date=July 22, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref>\n\n==Feature films==\n&lt;!-- This is for the movies that take place within the time period of BTAS only. -->\n&lt;!-- Do not add ''Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman''. -->\n* ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' (1993)&amp;nbsp;\u2013 based on ''The Animated Series''; the film started production as a direct-to-video release, but was ultimately changed into a theatrical release.&lt;ref>Bob Miller (June 1994). \"Knight Vision\".

It was released in the U.S. in October 2003 and was produced by Warner Bros. Animation.\n\n==Comic adaptation and novelization==\n{{main|The Batman Adventures}}\n{{main|Batman: The Adventures Continue}}\n''The Animated Series'' was accompanied by a tie-in comic book, ''The Batman Adventures'', which followed the art style and [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of ''The Animated Series'' instead of other Batman comic books. ''The Batman Adventures'', through several format changes to reflect the changing world of the series and its spin-offs, outlasted the series itself by nearly a decade, finally being cancelled in 2004 to make way for the tie-in comic of the then-new, unrelated Batman animated series; ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. The character of Harley Quinn's first official comic appearance occurred in issue twelve of the series. It has become highly sought after by collectors and fans of the character.\n\nThere was also a short-lived series of tie-in novels, adapted from episodes of the series by science fiction author [[Geary Gravel]]. To achieve novel-length, Gravel combined several related episodes into a single storyline in each novel. The novels included:\n* ''Shadows of the Past'' (\"Appointment in Crime Alley\", \"Robin's Reckoning\" two-parter)\n* ''Dual to the Death'' (\"Two-Face\" two-parter, \"Shadow of the Bat\" two-parter)\n* ''The Dragon and the Bat'' (\"Night of the Ninja\", \"Day of the Samurai\")\n* ''Mask of the Phantasm'' (''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' movie)\n\nDC announced in February 2020 that Paul Dini, Alan Burnett and artist Ty Templeton would be leading a new mini-series, ''[[Batman: The Adventures Continue]]'', to be first published in April 2020, based on the animated series and following shortly after its conclusion, with Tim Drake still adjusting as the new Robin to Batman.&lt;ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/2/13/21136687/batman-animated-series-comic-paul-dini-dc-comics-jason-todd | title = Batman: The Animated Series creator will continue the show \u2014 in comics | first= Austen | last=  Goslin | date=  February 13, 2020 | accessdate = February 13, 2020  | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref>\n\n==Broadcasting==\n{{For|video game|The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin (video game)}}\n''Batman: The Animated Series'' premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]'s children's block [[Fox Kids]] on September 5, 1992, and aired in that block during weekday afternoons at 4:30 PM.

During this time they created ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', which featured the same streamlined animation style as ''Superman: The Animated Series'', as well as numerous character re-designs from the original series despite taking place in the same continuity.\n\nIn 1999, a futuristic spin-off series titled ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' premiered on The WB, featuring a teenager named [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] taking on the duties of Batman under the guidance of an elderly Bruce Wayne.&lt;ref>{{cite news|title= FOR YOUNG VIEWERS; Introducing an Old-Time Hero To a New Generation|work= New York Times|date=September 19, 2004|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/19/arts/television/for-young-viewers-introducing-an-oldtime-hero-to-a-new.html|accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref> Then in 2001, the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series premiered on Cartoon Network, featuring Batman as one of the founding members of the [[Justice League|League]]. This was continued in 2004 by ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', featuring a greatly expanded League. Many DC cartoons unrelated to the larger DC animated universe, such as ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' and ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', also featured character designs strongly influenced by those of [[Bruce Timm]].\n\nThe dramatic writing and stylized art of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' separates it from many traditional comic book-based cartoons. It can be considered the dramatic equivalent of more adult-oriented cartoon shows like ''[[The Simpsons]]''. For this reason the show's popularity (along with that of its various spin-offs) endures among older audiences and comic book fans.\n\nThe [[Lego]] [[Lego minifigure|minifigures]] of various Batman characters are more strongly based on the designs from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' than any other form of Batman media.&lt;ref name=\"lego\">[http://batman.lego.com/en-US/story/default.aspx Lego] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826063822/http://batman.lego.com/en-US/story/default.aspx |date=August 26, 2010 }}, Batman Story.&lt;/ref> More precisely, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], [[Two-Face]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Mr. Freeze]] and [[Harley Quinn]]'s minifigures seem to have identical costumes and faces to the characters from the series.\n\nThe dark atmosphere, mature themes, and even some of the voice cast from the series are employed in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video game series.&lt;ref name=\"xbox\">[http://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/b/batmanarkhamasylum/ Batman: Arkham Asylum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721035044/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/b/batmanarkhamasylum/ |date=July 21, 2010 }}, game overview.&lt;/ref> Furthermore, [[Kevin Conroy]] reprises his role as Batman and the first two games are co-written by series veteran [[Paul Dini]].

The main theme of the show, which was heard during the opening and ending credits of each episode, was composed by [[Danny Elfman]]. At first, Elfman turned down Bruce Timm's offer to compose the theme for the show and so Timm hired [[Shirley Walker]] to do so. However, Elfman later changed his mind and composed a variation of his [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' movie]] theme for the series. Walker's unused theme went on to become the main theme for the second season of the show, when the name was changed to ''The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin''.&lt;ref>[http://btasscores.150m.com/ Batman Scores] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065932/http://btasscores.150m.com/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}, history behind the music.&lt;/ref>\n\nIn 1996, Walker won her first [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for her music direction of the episode \"A Bullet for Bullock\" (scored by Harvey R.

Television composer [[Kristopher Carter]] scored alongside Walker, Ritmanis, and McCuistion throughout the many [[DC animated universe|DCAU]] series and later filled in for Walker after her death in 2006.\n\n===Soundtracks===\n\nOn December 16, 2008, La La Land Records announced the release of a soundtrack companion to ''Batman: The Animated Series'' on a two-disc CD set, which featured 11 episode scores (including those of \"On Leather Wings\", the \"Two-Face\" two-parter, \"Joker's Favor\" and \"Perchance to Dream\").

[[Konami]] developed a game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES), while [[Sega]] released versions of the game for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[Sega Mega-CD|Mega-CD]] and [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]]. The SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive and Game Gear versions were side-scrolling action games, while the Mega-CD version featured a 3-D driving adventure. All of the games had art true to the series, while Sega's versions featured art elements directly from the show's creators.&lt;ref name=\"ign\">[http://cheats.ign.com/objects/005/005947.html IGN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008065236/http://cheats.ign.com/objects/005/005947.html |date=October 8, 2009 }}, ''The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin'' - Sega CD.&lt;/ref> The CD version has over 20 minutes of original animated footage comparable to the most well-crafted episodes,&lt;ref name=\"mobygames\">[http://www.mobygames.com/game/adventures-of-batman-robin Moby Games], ''The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin'' video game description.&lt;/ref> with the principal voice actors reprising their roles.\n\nThere was also a game made for the [[Game Boy]] based on the series and created around the same time. Developed and published by Konami, this game was distinctive upon the fact that it still used the earlier ''[[Batman: The Animated Series (video game)|Batman: The Animated Series]]'' moniker instead of ''The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin'' second season title given to the other games.\n\nThough not directly related, the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video game series features some of the voice cast from ''The Animated Series'' returning to their roles, notably including Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as The Joker. [[Arleen Sorkin]] also reprised her role as Harley Quinn in the first game of the series, ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]''; additionally, the first two games were written by ''Animated Series'' writer [[Paul Dini]]. Many of the characters' costumes from the series also appear as downloadable skins in the games.\n\n== Proposed spin-off ==\nDue to the success of the show, Fox approached [[Bruce Timm]] to make a spin-off centered on [[Catwoman]], but the project was abandoned shortly thereafter.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/abandoned/|title=The World's Finest - The DC Animation Resource|website=www.worldsfinestonline.com}}&lt;/ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Gotham Girls]]''\n* ''[[List of Batman: The Animated Series episodes]]'' aired from September 5, 1992\n* ''[[List of The New Batman Adventures episodes]]'' aired from September 13, 1997\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography {{anchor|Further reading|Books}}===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Dini, P. and Kidd, C.
