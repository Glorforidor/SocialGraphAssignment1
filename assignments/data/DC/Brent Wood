He first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Real Fact Comics]]&#39;&#39; #6 (January 1947).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was created by [[Jack Schiff]], [[George Kashdan]], Bernie Breslauer, [[Virgil Finlay]], and Howard Sherman. The comic was originally intended to feature non-fiction tales in the style of &#39;&#39;[[Ripley&#39;s Believe It or Not]]&#39;&#39;; Tommy Tomorrow&#39;s trip to Mars was presented as a future vision of space travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strip was a back-up feature in &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39; from issue #127 (Dec 1948) to #147 (Aug 1950).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schelly |first1=William |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1950s |date=2013 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781605490540 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nTommy Tomorrow graduated from Space Port \&quot;[[West Point]]\&quot; in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic\n | writer= Otto Binder\n | penciller = [[Curt Swan|Swan, Curt]]\n | inker = [[John Fischetti|Fischetti, John]]\n | story=The Interplanetary Aquarium\n | title=[[Action Comics]]\n | volume=1\n | issue=127\n | date=December 1948\n | publisher=[[National Comics Publications]]\n | location=New York\n |pages=1\u20138\n }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now a Colonel in the Planeteers, a police force in the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gotham City|Gotham]] is the capital city of not only the Earth but of the solar system. Every planet, every moon, and even many asteroids in the solar system seemed to have some weird alien life form or sentient race in this series, with even a life-giving ocean on [[Venus (planet)|Venus]]. \n\nHis first assignment from the Science Bureau was to get some alien fish for the new Interplanetary Aquarium. He meets Joan Gordy of the Interplanetary Radio News, who helps him in this assignment. At the end of the story, he is given the Planeteer Medal for getting the fish.\n\nThe character was meant to be a sort of \&quot;future everyman,\&quot; but he slowly changed into a policeman, and moved to other titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/tomorrow.htm |title=Tommy Tomorrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these stories, Tommy, later assisted by Captain Brent Wood, flew the space lanes in their patrol craft \&quot;Space Ace\&quot; donning purple uniforms with yellow trim. With &#39;&#39;Action&#39;&#39; #149, Tommy Tomorrow&#39;s adventures were now set in the year 2050, as it was realized by the creators that 1990 was optimistically too soon for such technology as the stories boasted. Most of his stories were written by [[Otto Binder]] and drawn by [[Jim Mooney]]. Tommy had a kid brother called Tim. Soon after it is revealed that Brent Wood is really the son of notorious space pirate Mart Black and that he was adopted by Captain Wood, who killed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic\n | writer=\n | penciller = [[Curt Swan|Swan, Curt]]\n | inker = [[John Fischetti|Fischetti, John]]\n | story=The Pirate Planeteer!\n | title=Action Comics\n | volume=1\n | issue=161\n | date=October 1951\n | publisher=National Comics Publications\n | location=New York\n |pages=1\u20138\n }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter a short hiatus, Tommy was retooled and then presented again in &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; #41 (1962), but did not get another series.  Captain Wood was dropped, giving Tommy an alien from Venus as a partner.  Writer [[Arnold Drake]] and artist [[Lee Elias]] were the creative team for this version.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn 1990, an alternate Tommy Tomorrow was a major character in [[Howard Chaykin]]&#39;s mini-series &#39;&#39;[[Twilight (comic book)|Twilight]]&#39;&#39;, which tried to bring in all of DC future science/space characters into one series (despite the fact that many occurred in different time periods).  Because Tomorrow did not know who his parents were, he was unbalanced, and he ran the Planeteers very autocratically, using them against his enemies, such as their rivals, the [[Knights of the Galaxy]].\n\nAccording to [[Starman (comics)#Farris Knight|Starman]] [[DC One Million|One Million]], one of the historically significant bearers of the Starman name is Tommy Tomorrow II.\n\nIn the aftermath of the &#39;&#39;[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]&#39;&#39;, it was shown that the [[Great Disaster]] that created [[Kamandi]]&#39;s world did not happen, and the boy who would have grown up to be Kamandi instead grew up to become Tommy Tomorrow.\n\nA Captain Tomorrow appears in &#39;&#39;[[Star Trek]]&#39;&#39;/&#39;&#39;[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]&#39;&#39;.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[Just Imagine...|Just Imagine! Stan Lee Creating the DC Universe]]&#39;&#39;, a teenager who grew up with Robin, and a servant of Reverend Darrk was named Tommy Tomorrow.\n\nA strange alien force seemingly colonizing the town of Demetri, Kansas makes reference to a \&quot;Major Tomorrow\&quot; of a group called the Planeteers in 2010&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Magog (comics)|Magog]]&#39;&#39; #7. It was alluded by various sources at the time that Tommy Tomorrow was going to be a new villain in the series.\n\nTomorrow also appears as \&quot;T&#39;omas T&#39;morra\&quot; in DC&#39;s 2013 &#39;&#39;[[Threshold (DC Comics)|Threshold]]&#39;&#39; comic by [[Keith Giffen]].\n\n==Bibliography==\nHe first appeared in short &#39;stories&#39; in &#39;&#39;Real Fact Comics&#39;&#39; #6, 8, 13, 16 (1947\u201348). He then appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Action Comics]]&#39;&#39; #127\u2013251 (1948\u201359), then moved to &#39;&#39;[[World&#39;s Finest Comics]]&#39;&#39; #102\u2013124 (1959\u201362). &#39;&#39;[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]&#39;&#39; #41, 42, 44, 46, 47 (1962\u201363).\n\n==In other media==\nAn image of Tommy Tomorrow appeared in the &#39;&#39;[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Finding Mr. Right\&quot; while [[King Shark]] was looking up potential nemeses for [[Harley Quinn]]. He made his first physical appearance in the season 2 finale \&quot;The Runaway Bridesmaid\&quot;, where he received a [[Freedom of the City|key to the city]] from the mayor of [[Gotham City|Gotham]] for his role in saving the city alongside the [[Justice League]] and later attended [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Kite Man]]&#39;s wedding.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://dcuguide.com/w/Tommy_Tomorrow DCU Guide: Tommy Tomorrow]\n*[http://dcuguide.com/w/Tommy_Tomorrow_Chronology DCU Guide: Tommy Tomorrow Chronology]\n{{Timeline\n|before = \u2190 The Batboat was debuted by David Clough Cameron and Win Mortimer.
