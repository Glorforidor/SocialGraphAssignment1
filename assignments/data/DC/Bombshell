The show is said to explore the darker side of many Batman projects, playing on key elements such as emotions, personal relations, fear of the unknown, as well as [[cyberpunk]] and [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] themes such as the issues and dilemmas of innovation and technological and scientific progress affecting society, and the psychology of the character of Bruce Wayne. As such, it was considerably darker than most other children&#39;s programs at the time, although producer [[Bruce Timm]] recalls it was conceived as a kid-friendly &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; cartoon.&lt;ref name=\&quot;mmv3\&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Modern Masters Volume 3: Bruce Timm |last= Nolen-Weathington |first= Eric |authorlink= |date= June 1, 2004 |publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |location= |isbn= 978-1-893905-30-6 |page= 67 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=EMwn_4llWK0C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Bruce+Timm+kid-friendly+Batman+Beyond+cartoon#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; series to portray the hero as a teenager. &#39;&#39;[[IGN]]&#39;&#39; named the show 40th on their list of \&quot;Top 100 Animated TV Series.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;ign\&quot;/&gt; The premise of &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; has been used in [[Batman Beyond (comics)|various comic book stories]] published by DC Comics, including an ongoing series beginning in 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Batman Beyond episodes}}\nThe pilot episode begins in 2019 (set about 20 years after &#39;&#39;[[The New Batman Adventures]]&#39;&#39; and 15 years after &#39;&#39;[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39;). [[Batman]], despite being past his prime and in his late 50s, continues to fight crime in a new high-tech [[Batsuit]]. In the rescue of a kidnapped heiress, Batman suffers a mild heart attack and, at risk of being beaten to death by one of the kidnappers, is forced to betray a lifelong principle by threatening to use a gun, which scared one of the kidnappers into running towards the police. Ashamed of what he did, Bruce ultimately but reluctantly decides to retire from crime-fighting and shuts down the [[Batcave]]. By this time, his butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and longtime allies ([[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James W. Gordon]], [[Lucius Fox]], [[Leslie Thompkins]], [[Renee Montoya]] and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]]) have either died or retired; his partners ([[Dick Grayson]], [[Barbara Gordon]], [[Tim Drake]] and [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]]) are still alive and have grown up and left or had falling-outs with Bruce after their retirement from their alter-egos; all of his enemies ([[Joker (character)|The Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Penguin (character)| The Penguin]], [[Riddler|The Riddler]], [[Two-Face]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Killer Croc]], [[Clayface]], [[Man-Bat]], [[Deadshot]], [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|The Mad Hatter]], [[Ra&#39;s al Ghul]] and his daughter [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]], the [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Arnold Wesker|Ventriloquist and Scarface]], the [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]], and [[Hugo Strange]]) are either retired, reformed, incarcerated, in exile, disappeared, or dead, and he had left the [[Justice League]].\n\nThe story moves ahead 20 years later to 2039 in [[Gotham City|Neo-Gotham]], a futuristic version of the old Gotham City and a [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] featuring staggering high rises and flying vehicles. Bruce is now an elderly man in his 70s and a recluse living in bitter isolation in [[Wayne Manor]], with no other companion but his guard dog [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]]. [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] is an athletic 16-year-old high school student and reformed troublemaker with a deeply ingrained sense of [[social justice]]. Living on difficult terms with his father Warren McGinnis, Terry disobeys his curfew one night to meet up with his girlfriend Dana Tan, only to incur the wrath of a group of the gang called the [[Jokerz]] harassing them. A high-speed motorcycle chase between Terry and the Jokerz leads them to the grounds of Wayne Manor, where they run into the elderly Bruce Wayne. Bruce and Terry fend off the Jokerz side-by-side, but the exertion aggravates Bruce&#39;s heart condition. Terry helps Bruce back to the manor and, while exploring the mansion after realizing that he is unable to leave the mansion as Ace is guarding it, stumbles upon the entrance to the Batcave and thus discovers Bruce&#39;s secrets, only to be chased out by an angered Bruce.\n\nTerry returns home to discover that his father has been murdered, apparently by the vengeful Jokerz. Soon after, he discovers that his father had stumbled onto information about the production of [[Biological warfare|illegal chemical weapons]] by [[Derek Powers]] through [[Wayne Enterprises|Wayne-Powers]] (Wayne Enterprises had merged with Powers&#39; company long ago) and that the man actually responsible for his father&#39;s murder is Powers&#39; personal assistant/bodyguard Mr. Fixx. Terry goes to Bruce for help but he refuses, feeling that he is too old and too weak to be of any use and instead tells Terry to take the evidence to Barbara Gordon (who has become the new Police Commissioner). After the evidence of the illegal weapon production is forcibly taken from Terry by Derek Powers, Terry subsequently steals the Batsuit, intending to bring Powers to justice. Bruce initially opposes all of Terry&#39;s efforts and vehemently demands that he return the suit, but Terry asks Bruce to let him take on the Batman mantle, partially by drawing on the fact Bruce lost both of his parents to a criminal he never caught, and that he (Terry) has the chance to catch his father&#39;s murderer. Bruce allows Terry to be Batman, and as Batman, Terry subsequently defeats Mr. Fixx. During the battle, Powers is exposed to the chemical and forced to flee into hiding to receive treatment, which subsequently mutates him into a radiation-emitting entity, though he uses artificial skin to hide the accident. Realizing that crime and corruption are running rampant in Gotham without Batman&#39;s presence, Bruce offers Terry the chance to assume the role of Batman, with Bruce himself mentoring Terry and in addition to working as Bruce&#39;s chauffeur and assistant so that Terry can support his family.\n\nThe new Batman soon develops his own rogues gallery, with both new villains (Derek Powers a.k.a. the radiation-emitting metahuman Blight; seductive shapeshifter [[Inque]]; the hypnotist [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]]; [[Sonic weapon|sound weaponizer]] Shriek; deadly assassin Curar\u00e9; insane eco-terrorist Mad Stan; cybernetically-enhanced African [[Big-game hunting|big game hunter]] the Stalker; nerdy [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] Willie Watt and a new version of the [[Royal Flush Gang]]) as well as some of his mentor&#39;s old foes, such as [[Mr. Freeze]] rejuvenated; [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]&#39;s strength-enhancing drug Venom reborn as slap-on patches; the [[Longevity|longevous]] [[Ra&#39;s al Ghul]]; and the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] himself, somewhat inevitably.\n\nTerry also makes allies in Neo-Gotham, including computer [[genius]] [[Maxine \&quot;Max\&quot; Gibson]]. After discovering Batman&#39;s secret identity, Maxine helps Terry with everything from [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]] to [[babysitting]]. Police Commissioner Barbara Gordon also works with Terry. Though initially unhappy about another person following in Bruce&#39;s dangerous footsteps, she admits that the city needs Batman, and that Terry could not be deterred from being Batman any more than she could have been from being Batgirl. He also has a relationship with Melanie Walker, who was forced to do the bidding of her family&#39;s new Royal Flush Gang under the code name Ten. Terry and Melanie&#39;s relationship is similar to that of Bruce and Selina Kyle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Batman Beyond characters|List of DC animated universe characters}}\n* [[Will Friedle]] as [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]]:&lt;br /&gt; The second Batman. Under the pretense of doing errands for Bruce, Terry fights crime as the new Batman. Terry was chosen to be the new Dark Knight as he shared a similar loss as Bruce had; that being the death of a parent.\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]]: &lt;br /&gt;The original Batman, he is Terry&#39;s employer, mentor, and predecessor who guides Terry through the Batcomputer but occasionally ventures into the field to help his successor if the situation demands it. During his final mission as Batman, Bruce suffered a [[heart attack]] that forced him to almost use a gun in self-defense; abhorred by this, holding the such-like weapon that took his [[Thomas Wayne|father]]&#39;s and [[Martha Wayne|mother]]&#39;s lives, he reluctantly hung up his cape and cowl. \n* [[Cree Summer]] as Maxine \&quot;Max\&quot; Gibson:&lt;br /&gt; A genius high schooler and friend of Terry&#39;s. She discovers his secret identity, and from then on occasionally helps Batman in an [[Alfred Pennyworth|\&quot;Alfred\&quot;]]-type role, though she is considered a nuisance to his predecessor (but less so as time went on). Her parents are divorced and she has an unnamed sister.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]]:&lt;br /&gt; Bruce Wayne&#39;s pet dog and his sole companion in Wayne Manor, the billionaire rescued and took in the stray [[Great Dane]] after the canine defended him from a [[Jokerz]] thug during one of Wayne&#39;s annual visits in memory of his parents to [[Crime Alley]]. Fiercely loyal to Bruce, he eventually develops a bond with Terry as well.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Episode list===\n{{main|List of Batman Beyond episodes}}\n{{:List of Batman Beyond episodes}}\n\n===Crossovers===\nThe third season of &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; featured the two-part episode \&quot;The Call\&quot; with (for the first time) a futuristic [[Justice League]], a [[springboard]] for the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]&#39;&#39; animated series. The setting and characters of &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; were also briefly revived in &#39;&#39;[[Static Shock]]&#39;&#39; during the episode \&quot;[[Future Shock (Static Shock)|Future Shock]]\&quot; in which [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] is accidentally transported 40 years into the future.\n\n&#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; revisited the &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; world twice in 2005. The first was in \&quot;[[The Once and Future Thing]]\&quot; (Part 2), which featured [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] transported 50 years into the future to stop a [[Chronos (comics)|time-travelling villain]] with the help of the future Justice League (Batman II, Static and Warhawk).\n\nThe second time was meant to be the de facto [[series finale]] for &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;: the episode \&quot;[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]]\&quot; reveals that Bruce Wayne is actually Terry McGinnis&#39; biological father. The story, set 15 years after &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;, centers on Terry (now a 31-year-old) tracking down an elderly [[Amanda Waller]]. She explains through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] that, even though she grew to trust and respect Batman, she was aware of him aging, thus accepting the idea of either Bruce retiring or being killed at some point. Finding the idea of a world without Batman unacceptable, Waller used her [[Project Cadmus]] connections to gather the technology for \&quot;Project Batman Beyond\&quot;, whose goal was to physically create a new Batman, starting with a secretly collected sample of Bruce Wayne&#39;s DNA. Some years after Bruce retired, Waller found a young Neo-Gotham couple\u2014the McGinnises\u2014with psychological profiles nearly identical to those of Bruce&#39;s parents, a [[Nanotechnology|nanotech]] solution was injected into Warren McGinnis to rewrite his [[Reproduction|reproductive]] material with that of Bruce. The eventual result was his wife Mary McGinnis giving birth to Terry, a child sharing the genetic traits of his mother and Bruce Wayne. When Terry was eight years old, Waller employed an elderly [[Andrea Beaumont|Phantasm]] (Andrea Beaumont, Bruce&#39;s ex-fianc\u00e9e, [[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm|whose exit]] from Bruce&#39;s life became one of the reasons why he became Batman in the first place) as an assassin to kill Terry&#39;s family, hoping the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] would put him on the path to becoming Batman. However, Beaumont could not commit the act, arguing that she would be doing something against what Bruce stood for. Waller eventually conceded that Beaumont had been right and abolished the project altogether. Eight years afterward, Warren would be murdered, and Terry would meet Bruce by happenstance\u2014resulting in Terry becoming Batman&#39;s successor. Waller concludes by reminding Terry that he is Bruce&#39;s son, not his clone, and that, despite the circumstances of his existence, he still has [[free will]] to live out his own life; Terry comes to terms with his revelations, and continues in being Batman. With a new sense of purpose, Terry plans to propose to Dana, while continuing his life of crimefighting. Whether Bruce was the genetic father of [[List of Batman Beyond characters#Terry.27s family|Matt McGinnis]] as well was not clearly established in-story, since nothing was stated as to the longevity of the alterations made to Warren McGinnis&#39; DNA; however, the series&#39; creators have said that this is the case.
