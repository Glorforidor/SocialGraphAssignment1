Because he had already placed a large number of \&quot;lost dog\&quot; announcements for Ace in his civilian identity of Bruce Wayne, he was concerned that anyone recognizing Ace (who had a prominent star-shaped marking on his forehead) might make the connection between Bruce Wayne and Batman. To forestall that problem, he hastily improvised a hood-like mask for the dog that incorporated the bat-emblem as a [[dog tag]] dangling from Ace&#39;s collar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schelly |first1=William |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1950s |date=2013 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781605490540 |pages=120, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace was subsequently christened the Bat-Hound by a criminal that the dog helped Batman to apprehend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume 1: Batman |date=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co |isbn=0-02-538700-6 |pages=1-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco01flei/page/n25/mode/2up |accessdate=29 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWilker later took a new job that made it difficult for him to take care of Ace, so he left the dog to Bruce Wayne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Baby Boomer Comics: The Wild, Wacky, Wonderful Comic Books of the 1960s!|last= Shutt|first= Craig|year= 1994|publisher= Krause Publications|ISBN= 0-87349-668-X|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilker was never aware that Ace was the Bat-Hound or that Bruce Wayne was Batman.\n\nAn early case involved Ace tracking down a mentally unhinged ancient weapons expert who was using his own weapons to commit crimes.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #130 (March 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Ace acquired superpowers thanks to [[Bat-Mite]], but this was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #158 (September 1963)&lt;/ref&gt; He did have his own training. For example; his specialized radio collar, when activated, told him to don his own mask (via a hands-free device) and track down Batman and Robin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Batman: The Complete History|last= Daniels|first= Les|year= 2004|publisher= Chronicle Books|ISBN= 0-81184-232-0|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ace was used less and less over time, and for various reasons. When Bruce was overcome with night terrors, Robin suggested that Ace sleep beside him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #156 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAce disappeared from the &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; comics after [[Julius Schwartz]] took over as editor in 1964. His last appearance was a cameo in a story where Batman had lost his fighting spirit.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #162 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; \n\n===Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39;===\nA version of Ace is seen in the cosmic realm of Limbo when the hero [[Animal Man]] takes a trip through it.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Animal Man&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) #25 (July 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nA modern-day version of Ace was reintroduced in &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #462 (June 1991), although he has been rarely seen in recent years. This version was originally a [[guide dog]] belonging to a blind [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] named Black Wolf, who called him \&quot;Dog\&quot;. The dog assisted Batman in fighting criminals from Black Wolf&#39;s tribe. Following Black Wolf&#39;s death, Batman adopted Dog, renaming him Ace.\n\nHe did not wear a mask, nor was he ever referred to as Bat-Hound, and has the appearance of an [[English Mastiff]] with a bat-shaped dark patch on his flank. Ace has at times helped Batman on cases&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) #471 (November 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and is depicted to be very affectionate towards his owner and vice versa.\n\nAfter Batman is disabled by the villain Bane, [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] takes over the role and ejects Ace, Nightwing, Robin and [[Harold Allnut]] from the Batcaves. Harold, a trusted confidante of Batman, takes in Ace; they live in a part of the caverns that Azrael is unfamiliar with.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #500 (October 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; To keep busy, Ace enjoys playing with a robotic mouse built by Harold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Essential Batman Encyclopedia|last= Greenberger|first= Robert|year= 2008|publisher= Random House Digital, Inc|ISBN= 9780345501066|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAce disappeared without explanation after the events of the &#39;&#39;[[No Man&#39;s Land (comics)|No Man&#39;s Land]]&#39;&#39; storyline in the late 1990s. He cameos in &#39;&#39;[[Ambush Bug: Year None]]&#39;&#39;.\n\nA traditional Ace was seen in &#39;&#39;[[Final Crisis]]: Superman Beyond 3D&#39;&#39;. He is in Limbo with other \&quot;forgotten characters\&quot;, such as [[Gunfire (comics)|Gunfire]], [[Geist (DC Comics)|Geist]], Hardhat of the [[Demolition Team]] and Merryman of the [[Inferior Five]]. Merryman explains that everyone is here where no stories exist, because nobody is writing about them. Despite this, Superman and his allies work to rescue all the residents of Limbo, who then assist in the battle against the cosmic threat of Mandrakk.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Final Crisis: Superman Beyond 3D&#39;&#39; #1-2 (October-November 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe original Ace appeared in a flashback scene in &#39;&#39;[[Batman Inc.]]&#39;&#39; #4, thus making the current canon status of the Post-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39; Ace unclear. In this story, Ace is trying to play with Robin, who is fuming over Kathy Kane, a.k.a. [[Batwoman]], and her influence on Batman.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman Inc.&#39;&#39; #4 (October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;The New 52&#39;&#39;===\nIn &#39;&#39;Batman and Robin Vol. 1: Born to Kill&#39;&#39;, as part of &#39;&#39;[[The New 52]]&#39;&#39; (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Bruce is seen purchasing a black Great Dane from a kennel. He later gives this dog to his son, Damian, who names him Titus, though writer Peter Tomasi stated in an interview that he considered naming the dog Ace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/peter-tomasi-batman-and-robin-120120.html Newsarma article]&lt;/ref&gt; Damian rejects the dog at first, but eventually bonds with him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman and Robin&#39;&#39; Vol. 2 #2&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===&#39;&#39;DC Rebirth&#39;&#39;===\nIn &#39;&#39;[[DC Rebirth]]&#39;&#39;, a different Ace was introduced in &#39;&#39;Batman Annual&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #1, in which he is depicted as a former guard dog of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] who fought Batman until Joker left him and the other dogs without food in a ditch to fight amongst themselves. The dogs had card symbols on them, and the brown dog with an ace on it killed the others. He was sent to the Gotham Pound, and [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] adopted him two days later. In order to facilitate this, Alfred actually purchases the Gotham Pound, turning it into the Martha and Thomas Wayne Humane Society. Alfred spends the next couple of months training the dog despite Bruce&#39;s objections, as he thinks Ace&#39;s wounds from the Joker&#39;s actions cannot be healed. Despite this, Alfred manages to properly train him in time for Christmas, and Bruce starts bonding with the dog after getting injured during one of his night shifts. He gets Ace a bat-mask for Christmas and calls him a \&quot;Bat Hound\&quot;. Though the Gotham Pound owner described Ace as a female, Bruce and Alfred have called Ace a him, leaving the gender ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman Annual&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #1 (Jan. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAce is seen later, playing with visitors. He again obeys Alfred without question. &lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; (vol. 3) #33 (Dec. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nTitus is seen as a pet living in Wayne Manor. It alerts Alfred of [[Duke Thomas (comics)|Duke Thomas]]&#39;s sneaking out.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;All-Star Batman&#39;&#39; #7 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMuch like the TV show &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39;, a [[Great Dane]] named Ace is shown to have been owned by Bruce in his old age.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman Beyond: Rebirth&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Other versions==\nIn [[Mark Waid]]&#39;s and [[Alex Ross]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]&#39;&#39; miniseries, Ace is portrayed as the giant winged steed of the [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] Batwoman. Ace is also mentioned in [[Howard Chaykin]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Elseworlds]]&#39;&#39; crossover &#39;&#39;[[Batman/Houdini: The Devil&#39;s Workshop]]&#39;&#39;. During a seance attended by Bruce Wayne and mystic debunker [[Harry Houdini]], Ace was referred to as Bruce Wayne&#39;s childhood pet. In the &#39;&#39;Elseworlds&#39;&#39; [[Frankenstein]] pastiche &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Castle of the Bat]]&#39;&#39;, Dr. Bruce Wayne tests his theories by creating a literal Bat-Hound: a dog with some of the attributes of a bat. A version of Ace appears in multiple issues of &#39;&#39;[[Tiny Titans]]&#39;&#39;, a comic created for younger readers. Ace appears in the alternate universe &#39;Unkillables&#39; storyline, assisting Jason Todd. &lt;ref&gt;\&quot;DCeased: Unkillables\&quot; #1 (2020)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nPre-&#39;&#39;Crisis&#39;&#39;, [[Superman]]&#39;s Batman-like identity of [[Nightwing]] included a [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]]ian counterpart to Ace the Bat-Hound, a telepathic dog named \&quot;Nighthound\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;World&#39;s Finest&#39;&#39; #143 (August 1964)&lt;/ref&gt;\n&lt;!--Yes, Superman. He was Nightwing first, and in Kandor!--&gt;\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Ace the Bat-Hound appears in &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond]]&#39;&#39;, with vocal effects done by [[Frank Welker]]. This version is Bruce Wayne&#39;s pet and guard dog that is a [[Great Dane]] mix. He made his first appearance in the series premiere episode \&quot;Rebirth\&quot;. At first, Ace did not like [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]], but after he and Terry were able to help each other on several missions, Terry earned Ace&#39;s affection and loyalty. The episode \&quot;Ace in the Hole\&quot; reveals Ace&#39;s origins; he was a puppy that was bought by illegal dog-fighting ring leader Ronnie Boxer but managed to escape this abusive, violent life. He soon found fellow tormented soul Bruce at Crime Alley during the anniversary of his parents&#39; murders. After he was injured by a member of the [[Jokerz]] gang during an attempt to save Bruce from the thug, Bruce took the dog into his personal care and Ace has been his sole companion in Wayne Manor ever since. After encountering Boxer once again, Ace and Batman stop Boxer&#39;s attempt to use synthetic growth hormones to turn dogs into monsters. Ace also plays a role in the movie &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]&#39;&#39;, when he engaged a member of the Jokerz that had been spliced with hyena DNA and then assisted Batman by attacking the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], which freed Batman from captivity and damaged the controls for Joker&#39;s new satellite weapon system. This version of Ace is presumably named after Ace from the [[Royal Flush Gang]], whom Batman comforted before her death as revealed in the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League Unlimited]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Epilogue\&quot;.[[Image:bathound2005.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Ace the Bat-Hound in the animated series &#39;&#39;[[Krypto the Superdog]]&#39;&#39;]]\n* Ace the Bat-Hound appears as a cameo &#39;&#39;[[Static Shock]]&#39;&#39; in the episode \&quot;Future Shock\&quot;.\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Krypto the Superdog]]&#39;&#39;, that stars [[Krypto]] the Superdog ([[Superman]]&#39;s childhood dog), Ace the Bat-Hound (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]]) makes occasional appearances and is once again a crime-fighting ally of Batman - although the Dark Knight himself does not appear in the show. In this series, Ace, much like Batman, is equipped with various gadgets and equipment as an aid in his crime-fighting efforts. In one episode, he met the [[Dog Star Patrol]] and helped them find their missing member Hot Dog. His enemies include the Joker&#39;s [[Hyena|hyenas]] [[Bud and Lou]], the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]&#39;s trained birds called the Bad News Birds (Artie the [[Puffin]], Griff the [[Vulture]], and Waddles the [[Penguin]]), and [[Catwoman]]&#39;s pet cat Isis (who flirts with Ace, much like Catwoman flirts with Batman). Ace has a [[Batwoman]]-style glider that he uses for more speed.

Ace manages to corner Catman up a tree and Batman rewards him with a bat-shaped treat after getting him to heel. Ace is later seen in the episode&#39;s main plot as a guise that [[Bat-Mite]] created.

In the episode \&quot;The Plague of the Prototypes!\&quot;, Ace is friends with Proto (Batman&#39;s prototype Bat-Robot) and encourages him to save Batman from [[Black Mask (character)|Black Mask]] when the False Face Society hacks into the Bat-Robots and reprograms them.
