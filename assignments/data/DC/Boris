She first appeared in [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|&#39;&#39;Steel&#39;&#39; (vol. 2)]] #1 (February 1994).&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; She becomes the fifth superhero to use the name &#39;&#39;&#39;Steel&#39;&#39;&#39; when her uncle [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]] is injured. In the 2006 limited series &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39;, Natasha gains superpowers and uses the codename &#39;&#39;&#39;Starlight&#39;&#39;&#39;. When her powers change, allowing her to become a being of living mist she assumes the codename &#39;&#39;&#39;Vaporlock&#39;&#39;&#39;.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nNatasha Irons is the daughter of John Henry&#39;s brother, Clay, and Clay&#39;s wife Blondel. She is introduced in the first issue of Steel&#39;s solo series, where she is initially portrayed as being 13. Like the rest of her family, she knew about Steel&#39;s secret identity all along. Contrasting sharply with her brother Jemahl, Natasha is shown to be very level headed and practical. By issue #14, she is shown to be working (presumably as an intern) for a U.S. Senator. She appears to have aged forward to be about 16 somehow. Nat is a supporting character throughout Louise Simonson&#39;s run on the series. She is kidnapped by Hazard and Steel has to rescue her. She also uses the drug Tar to help fight at her uncle&#39;s side briefly. She is later kidnapped by the villain Plasmus and apparently kills him by shattering once Steel froze the villain (although he later turns up alive). Natasha was devastated at the loss of her beloved great-grandmother, Bess Irons, but is the only one of her family who stays with Steel when he moves to Jersey City (see the [[John Henry Irons|Steel]] entry for more details of the Irons family).\n\nWith Christopher Priest at the helm of &#39;&#39;Steel&#39;&#39; starting with #34, Nat was radically altered. She was transformed into a more stereotypical modern teenager with a flippant attitude. All trace of her previous work for a U.S. Senator was never referenced. During this time she also meets and befriends a teen named Paul, whom she dubs \&quot;Boris\&quot;. Her father also makes a return as the villain Crash. When an assassin named Skorpio poisons Nat, Crash has to turn himself in so that he can give a blood transfusion and save his daughter. He is never seen nor heard from again.\n\nNat later goes with Steel to Metropolis when he opens up Steelworks there. She becomes his assistant, even reprogramming [[Superman]]&#39;s Kryptonian robot [[Kelex]] to speak hip hop slang. For a time she is dating a local boy, Boris.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman: The Man of Steel&#39;&#39; #100 (May 2000). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===The new Steel===\n[[Image:Steel2.jpg|thumb|left|Natasha as Steel. Art by [[Pascual Ferry]].|upright]]\nWhen the Entropy Aegis of [[Darkseid]] traps John, Natasha designs a suit of armor that uses the Aegis&#39; power, teleports to [[Apokolips]], and fights [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] with the help of [[Superman]], [[Superboy (Modern Age)|Superboy]], [[Linda Danvers|Supergirl]], and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|the pre-Crisis Supergirl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nJohn is too injured to continue operating as Steel. Having intended to pass his legacy as Steel on to Natasha, John made a new, more advanced suit of armor for her to use.\n\nWhen Natasha hears that Superman has been injured by a ghostly ninja, she dons her armor and becomes the new Steel. She teams up with [[Cir-El]] and [[Traci Thirteen|Girl 13]] to stop the ninja. During the adventure, she uses her hammer to fire an electric pulse into Superman&#39;s heart to start it again.\n\nAs part of the &#39;&#39;[[Superman/Batman]]&#39;&#39; \&quot;Public Enemies\&quot; arc, false news of Batman and Superman&#39;s capture by the forces of President [[Lex Luthor]] is leaked to draw out their various associates into attacking the [[White House]]. Cir-El, Natasha, [[Krypto]], Superboy and the [[Batman Family]] do exactly that. Natasha is neutralized early in the incident, staying back to try to rescue Cir-El and Superboy from a crushing deathtrap. Instead, Batman saves them.\n\nNatasha is briefly seen in a cameo role during the events of \&quot;[[Infinite Crisis]]\&quot;.\n\n===Starlight===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of Infinity Inc. members]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;\n\nIn &#39;&#39;[[52 (comics)|52]]&#39;&#39;, Natasha has a violent falling out with her uncle John, over John&#39;s disgust over what he feels is the self-absorbed [[narcissism]] of the DC Universe&#39;s superhero community. When Natasha discovers that the [[Teen Titans]] (whose roster was devastated by the events of [[Infinite Crisis]]) are holding an open call for new members, John forbids Natasha from going and instead insists she continue the clearing out debris from the battle of Metropolis. When Natasha refuses, John dismantles her armor, and she is left powerless. John also makes it clear that she will have to build her own armor if she wants to be a super-hero.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; #1 (May 2006). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Image:Infinity Inc v2 1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Natasha as Starlight.]]\nSoon, Natasha attempts to rebuild her armor, with little success. When she learns that John had his DNA rewritten by the exo-gene, Natasha wrongly assumes John chose to have his DNA altered and snaps.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; #8 (June 2006). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter a fierce argument with her uncle, Natasha applies for Luthor&#39;s \&quot;Everyman Project\&quot; and becomes one of the first official subjects.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; #9 (July 2006). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; When John, looking for Natasha, threatens to kill Luthor at a Lexcorp party, Natasha appears, along with a team of super-powered people in Luthor&#39;s employ, and beats him severely. From that point, she is estranged from her uncle, who makes numerous attempts to contact her, which she rebuffs. Gifted with new skills, Natasha is given the codename &#39;&#39;&#39;Starlight&#39;&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; #21 (September 2006). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; While in battle, she witnesses her friend [[Trajectory (comics)|Eliza Harmon]] (a.k.a. Trajectory) killed by a new [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)#The New Blockbuster|Blockbuster]]. Natasha is finally contacted by John on New Year&#39;s Eve, who forces her to rethink everything that Luthor has told her. After the \&quot;Rain of the Supermen,\&quot; in which Lex Luthor deactivates the powers of each Everyman hero outside of Infinity, Inc. (causing many to plummet from the sky; this forms the basis of the title pun on \&quot;The Reign of the Supermen\&quot; storyline), Natasha realizes that her uncle was right all along.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; #35 (January 2007). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; She then begins working as a double agent within Luthor&#39;s organization. However, she is found out and beaten by Luthor, who has acquired superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; #39 (January 2007). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSteel and the Teen Titans launch an attack on LexCorp and manage to rescue Natasha. However, Lex stripped her of her Starlight powers.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; #40 (February 2007). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she is seen escorting Luthor into custody, wearing a new set of armour made for her by her uncle.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; #46 (March 2007). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The duo restore Steelworks, and Natasha is later seen, during the [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]] assembling a nanotech payload missile to fire over Black Adam, although the missile is stolen by [[Booster Gold]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;52&#39;&#39; #50 (April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Natasha survives the battle, and resumes working at Steelworks.\n\n=== Vaporlock ===\nThe new &#39;&#39;[[Infinity, Inc.]]&#39;&#39; series reveals that the Everyman Project has had a lingering effect on its subjects. Natasha now has the ability to dissolve into a cloud of gas, although she has difficulty controlling it.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity, Inc.&#39;&#39; (2007) #1 (November 2007). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Her uncle suggests she adopt the codename \&quot;Vaporlock.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity, Inc.&#39;&#39; (2007) #8 (June 2008). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final issue, of the series all the [[Infinity Inc]] members are prisoners in the [[Dark Side Club]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Infinity, Inc.&#39;&#39; (2007) #12 (October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the &#39;&#39;[[Terror Titans]]&#39;&#39; miniseries they are released thanks to [[Miss Martian]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Terror Titans&#39;&#39; #6 (May 2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== \&quot;Jenny\&quot; Blake and Project 7734 ===\nAfter being released from the Dark Side Club, the members of [[Infinity Inc.]] take new names and infiltrate a government project named Project 7734. The goal of the project is simple: the death of Superman. Towards that end, the government project has placed satellites in space that fire magic lasers, plucked the powerful Atlas from the time stream, release Metallo, and brainwashed people.\n\nNatasha is not sure whom to trust as part of Project: Breach (the brainwashing of [[Captain Atom]]). She visits Earth to tell Jimmy Olsen, who has been looking into Project 7734, about Captain Atom and leaves just before Jimmy is found and shot by [[Codename: Assassin]]. In the &#39;&#39;Captain Atom&#39;&#39; back-up story in &#39;&#39;Action Comics&#39;&#39;, Captain Atom remembers who he is, revealing his real name and rank along with the \&quot;Codename: Captain Atom\&quot;. Joining others of Project 7734 (such as Codename: Superwoman and Codename: Metallo), Natasha is part of the team that takes down Captain Atom to brainwash him before they are attacked by the natives of the magical world where Project 7734 is located. The natives want her to help them with Captain Atom.\n\nFollowing this, Natasha is shown helping Steel rescue civilians during the &#39;&#39;[[Reign of Doomsday]]&#39;&#39; event. [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] attacks Natasha in order to draw Steel&#39;s attention, and though she escapes unscathed, Steel is ultimately beaten into submission and captured.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Steel&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the \&quot;[[DC Rebirth]],\&quot; continuity, Natasha is back to using her armor and no longer has any of her Vaporlock abilities.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superwoman&#39;&#39; #2. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Here she was in a romantic relationship with Traci 13, but they broke up &lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superwoman&#39;&#39; #5. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; (though it&#39;s not confirmed whether she&#39;s a lesbian or bisexual). Following the No Justice event, she becomes a member of the new incarnation of the Titans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newsarama.com/39502-nightwing-leads-new-titans-team-out-of-no-justice.html NIGHTWING Leads New TITANS Team Out of NO JUSTICE] -Newsarama&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[Image:LuminaSketch.jpg|thumb|Natasha gains superpowers.]]\n\n===Exo-gene===\n*As Starlight, Natasha is able to fly, exert superhuman strength, and is more durable. Her fists also emit large flashes of light. She also can focus her light into forcefields, and trap her opponents within them, such as when she encased [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] in a light energy field to prevent him from moving.\n*As Vaporlock, Natasha has the ability to transform her body into a gaseous substance.\n\n===Armor===\n*Natasha&#39;s \&quot;Steel\&quot; armor boosts her strength to super-human levels, and rockets in her boots allow her to fly. The armor can grow to heights of up to 60 feet, and it is equipped with limited-technomorphing abilities able to shift energy guns and projectile weaponry from its liquid-metal.\n*Natasha&#39;s main weapon is her hammer, which has inertial dampeners that cause the hammer&#39;s force to increase exponentially (the farther it is thrown, the harder it hits). The hammer can fire electromagnetic pulses and generate powerful electric and magnetic fields at Natasha&#39;s command. When the hammer is placed on the ground, it connects with the Earth&#39;s magnetic field and cannot be moved except by Natasha or someone with similar DNA, such as her uncle John Henry Irons.\n*The original, Entropy-Aegis-fueled armor endowed her with enhanced strength and [[teleportation]], and enabled her to fire blasts of strange, purple energy from her hands.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Kingdom Come===\nNatasha (as Steel) is a background character in the limited series &#39;&#39;[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]&#39;&#39;, wearing a giant version of her later armor with the head-tails. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n===Flashpoint===\nIn the alternate timeline of the &#39;&#39;[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]&#39;&#39; event, Natasha Irons is a member of the [[Brazilian Army]] who battles against the Nazis in [[Brazil]]. She encounters [[Traci 13]] after she accidentally teleports herself to Brazil, with Natasha initially thinking she was sent by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. Natasha asks Traci to join her team, but Traci is forced to leave in order to help save the world. Soon after this, Traci teleports away and wishes Natasha good luck with her war, which Natasha does to her also.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint&#39;&#39; #2 (July 2011). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Ame-Comi===\nNatasha appears as the Steel of the Ame-Comi universe with an [[Anime]]-styled redesign. She is first approached by [[Carrie Kelley]] after [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] is kidnapped by [[Duela Dent]], and agrees to help after learning how dire the situation it. It is mentioned in passing that Natasha possesses superhuman intelligence in this continuity, as she is able to process information twelve times faster than an average human.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ame-Comi Batgirl&#39;&#39; #3 (July 2012). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After recruiting [[Jesse Quick|the Flash]], the three young heroines set out to face down Dent.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ame-Comi Duela Dent&#39;&#39; #2 (July 2012). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Superman Family Adventures===\nA teenage version of Natasha appears in the series as a friend and classmate of [[Jimmy Olsen]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superman Family Adventures&#39;&#39; #3 (July 2012).
