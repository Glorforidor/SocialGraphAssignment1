Arkham Asylum first appeared in &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #258 (Oct. 1974), written by [[Dennis O&#39;Neil]] with art by [[Irv Novick]].\n\nArkham Asylum serves as a psychiatric hospital for the [[Gotham City]] area, housing patients who are criminally insane. Arkham&#39;s high-profile patients are often members of Batman&#39;s [[List of Batman Family enemies#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]].\n\n==History==\nLocated in [[Gotham City]], Arkham Asylum is where Batman&#39;s foes who are considered to be mentally ill are brought as patients (other foes are incarcerated at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]). Although it has had numerous administrators, some comic books have featured [[Jeremiah Arkham]]. Inspired by the works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and in particular his fictional city of [[Arkham|Arkham, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name=\&quot;Unauthorised\&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Batman Unauthorized: Vigilantes, Jokers, and Heroes in Gotham City |first=Dennis |last=O&#39;Neil |publisher=BenBella Books |year=2008 |page=[https://archive.org/details/batmanunauthoriz0000unse/page/111 111] |isbn=1-933771-30-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/batmanunauthoriz0000unse/page/111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Dark Age\&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dark Age: Grim, Great &amp; Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics |first1=Mark |last1=Voger |first2=Kathy |last2=Voglesong |page=5 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=1-893905-53-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the asylum was introduced by [[Dennis O&#39;Neil]] and [[Irv Novick]] and first appeared in &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #258 (October 1974); much of its [[back-story]] was created by [[Len Wein]] during the 1980s.\n\nArkham Asylum has a poor security record and high recidivism rate, at least with regard to the high-profile cases\u2014patients, such as the Joker, are frequently shown escaping at will\u2014and those who are considered to no longer be mentally unwell and discharged tend to re-offend. Furthermore, several staff members, including its founder, Dr. [[Amadeus Arkham]], and his nephew, director Dr. [[Jeremiah Arkham]], as well as staff members [[Harley Quinn|Dr. Harleen Quinzel]], [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lyle Bolton]] and, in some incarnations, Dr. [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]] and Professor [[Hugo Strange]], have become mentally unwell.\n\nIn addition, prisoners with unusual medical conditions that prevent them from staying in a regular prison are housed in Arkham. For example, [[Mr. Freeze]] is not always depicted as mentally ill, but he requires a strongly refrigerated environment to stay alive; Arkham, with special conditions required for certain patients or inmates being a regularity rather than an exception, is seen by authorities to be an ideal location under certain circumstances.\n\nGotham criminals deemed \&quot;criminally insane\&quot; or \&quot;mentally unfit\&quot; by the court of law generally are treated at Williams Medical Center before being deemed dangerous enough to be sent to Arkham Asylum.&lt;ref name=Laugh&gt;{{Cite comic | writer= [[Ed Brubaker|Brubaker, Ed]] |artist=[[Doug Mahnke|Mahnke, Doug]] |colorist=[[David Baron (comics)|Baron, David]] | letterer=Leigh, Rob |title=[[Batman: The Man Who Laughs]]| date=February 2005 | publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Arkham-Asylum.jpg|thumb|Arkham Asylum in &#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #14 (January 2013). Art by Jason Fabok.]]\nServing as a [[Gotham City]] psychiatric hospital, Arkham Asylum has a long and brutal history, beginning when its own architect became mentally unwell and hacked his workers to death with an axe. He was convicted and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in the same asylum he had been building.&lt;ref name=Laugh /&gt; The one-shot graphic novel &#39;&#39;[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]&#39;&#39; establishes that the asylum was named after Elizabeth Arkham, the mother of founder [[Amadeus Arkham]]. The original name of the asylum was \&quot;Arkham Hospital\&quot;. Its dark history began in the early 1900s when Arkham&#39;s mother, having suffered from [[mental illness]] most of her life, committed [[suicide]]. However, it was later revealed that her son had actually [[euthanasia|euthanized]] her and repressed the memory. Amadeus then decided, as the sole heir to the Arkham estate, to remodel his family home in order to properly treat the mentally ill, so others might not suffer the same fate as his mother.\n\nPrior to the period of the hospital&#39;s remodeling, Amadeus Arkham treated patients at the State Psychiatric Hospital in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where he, his wife Constance and his daughter Harriet had been living for quite some time. Upon his telling his family of his plans, they moved back to his family home to oversee the remodeling. While there, Amadeus Arkham received a call from the police notifying him that [[Mad Dog (DC Comics)#Martin .22Mad Dog.22 Hawkins|Martin \&quot;Mad Dog\&quot; Hawkins]], a [[serial killer]], referred to Amadeus Arkham by Metropolis Penitentiary while at State Psychiatric Hospital, had escaped from prison and sought his considered opinion on the murderer&#39;s state of mind. Shortly afterward, Amadeus Arkham returned to his home to find his front door wide open. Inside, he discovered the [[raped]] and mutilated corpses of his wife and daughter in an upstairs room, with Mad Dog&#39;s alias carved on Harriet&#39;s body. Despite this family tragedy, the Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane officially opened that November.\n\nWith his sanity in tatters, Dr. Arkham designed a floor plan that evoked [[occult]] runes, he believed that the pattern would drive away the mysterious bat that haunted his dreams.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman The World of the Dark Knight&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt; One of its first patients was Mad Dog, whom Amadeus Arkham insisted on treating personally. After treating Mad Dog for six months, Amadeus Arkham strapped him to an [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock]] couch, then deliberately and purposefully [[electric shock|electrocuted]] him. The staff treated the death as an accident, but it contributed to Amadeus Arkham&#39;s gradual descent into mental illness, which he began to believe was his birthright. Eventually, Amadeus Arkham was a patient in his own asylum after he tried to kill his stockbroker in [[Great Depression|1929]], where he died scratching the words of a binding spell into the walls and floor of his cell with his fingernails and belting out \&quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\&quot; in a loud voice.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Serious\&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Arkham Asylum (Batman -258 (October 1974)).jpg|thumb|right|Arkham Hospital in &#39;&#39;[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]&#39;&#39; #258 (October [[1974 in comics|1974]]). Art by [[Irv Novick]].]]\nArkham Asylum first appeared in October 1974 in &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #258, written by [[Dennis O&#39;Neil]] and drawn by [[Irv Novick]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In this story, it is named as \&quot;Arkham Hospital\&quot;, although it is not clear what kind of hospital it is. \&quot;Arkham Asylum\&quot; first appeared in another O&#39;Neil story the following year, but it was not until 1979 that \&quot;Arkham Asylum\&quot; completely replaced \&quot;Arkham Hospital\&quot;, and the occasional \&quot;Arkham Sanitarium\&quot;, as the institution&#39;s name. Also in 1979, the move to have the asylum closer to Gotham had begun; that was completed in 1980, when &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #326 by [[Len Wein]] described the asylum&#39;s location \&quot;deep in the [[suburb]]s of Gotham City\&quot;. It is perhaps for this reason that &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #326 is listed in some histories as the first appearance of Arkham Asylum. It was also Wein who, in 1985&#39;s &#39;&#39;Who&#39;s Who: The Definitive Dictionary of the DC Universe&#39;&#39; #1, created its current backstory.\n\nArkham Asylum has been demolished or destroyed several times in its history, notably during the events of &#39;&#39;Batman: The Last Arkham&#39;&#39; (see below). It is also seriously damaged at the beginning of the &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]&#39;&#39; storyline, when [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] uses stolen munitions to blow up the facility and release all the patients. After these events, the asylum is relocated to a large mansion known as \&quot;Mercey Mansion\&quot;. At the beginning of the &#39;&#39;[[No Man&#39;s Land (comics)|No Man&#39;s Land]]&#39;&#39; storyline, the asylum is closed down and all its patients discharged. In this instance, a timer was used to open the doors two minutes before the city is sealed. This is orchestrated by the administrator himself, Dr. [[Jeremiah Arkham]], the nephew of Amadeus Arkham, who had the choice of discharging the patients or watching them all starve or kill each other. In the middle of the story, it is revealed during the &#39;&#39;Prodigal&#39;&#39; storyline that Batman has established a hidden base within the sub-basement of the asylum  known as the \&quot;Northwest [[Batcave]]\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;NMLSFO\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=Kwitney, Alissa |penciller=Zulli, Michael |inker=Locke, Vince |colorist=Giddings, Noelle |letterer= Schubert, Willie |title=Batman: No Man&#39;s Land Secret Files and Origins |story=Batcaves |issue=#1 |date=December 1999 |publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was blown up by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the &#39;&#39;[[Battle for the Cowl]]&#39;&#39; story arc.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Cowl1\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=Daniel, Tony S |penciller=Daniel, Tony S |inker=Florea, Sandu |colorist=Hannin, Ian |letterer= Fletcher, Jared K |title=Batman: Battle for the Cowl |story=A Hostile Takeover |issue=#1 |date=May 2009 |publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;Battle for the Cowl&#39;&#39; one-shot, Dr. Jeremiah Arkham wanders among the remains of the asylum as he muses on his life. He reveals that he has discovered blueprints created by his uncle, Dr. Amadeus Arkham, for a new Arkham Asylum. He also contemplates the fates of his own nonviolent \&quot;special\&quot; patients: an artist with almost no facial features who must paint facial expressions onto his almost blank face to express himself; a man obsessed with his own reflection in a series of mirrors in his room; and a woman supposedly so ugly, one glance at her face would cause anyone to become mentally ill. Upon discovering his \&quot;special\&quot; patients (unharmed from the destruction thanks to their secluded cells), Arkham resolves to rebuild the facility according to his ancestor&#39;s vision, but to serve as a literal asylum for mentally ill patients in order to shelter them from the outside world. However, when told to be happy with the new development, the artist secretly paints his face white with a hideous grin, reminiscent of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]; it is implied that the \&quot;special\&quot; patients, as well as Arkham himself, have given in to mental illness.\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;Arkham Reborn&#39;&#39; miniseries, Arkham Asylum is rebuilt and financed by Dr. Arkham.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Reborn\&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=Hine, David |artist=Haun, Jeremy |colorist=Kalisz, John |letterer=Cipriano, Sal |title=Arkham Reborn |issue=#1\u20133 |date=October\u2013December 2009 |publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #697, Dr. Arkham is revealed to be the new Black Mask and is a patient in his own asylum. It was also revealed during &#39;&#39;Arkham Reborn,&#39;&#39; that as both Dr. Arkham and Black Mask, he had begun to manipulate patients, a plotline that culminated in &#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; with Alyce Sinner becoming the new head of the facility, but secretly working with Arkham/Black Mask. It was also revealed that the \&quot;special\&quot; patients were figments of Arkham&#39;s imagination.\n\nDuring &#39;&#39;[[Batman Eternal]]&#39;&#39;, Arkham Asylum is destroyed as part of the villains&#39; assault on Batman, with Bruce Wayne also being declared bankrupt after Wayne Enterprises loses most of its assets following Hush detonating some of Batman&#39;s hidden weapons caches around the city. As a result, Wayne Manor is repossessed by the city and turned into the new Arkham Asylum,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Arkham Manor&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt; but Bruce decides to accept the situation on the grounds that he can now keep a closer eye on his foes in the asylum due to his intimate knowledge of the manor&#39;s entrances and exits (after sealing off the entrance to the Batcave from the manor).&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Arkham Manor&#39;&#39; #6&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Staff==\n===[[Prison warden|Wardens]]===\n{{expand section|date=October 2015}}\n* [[Amadeus Arkham|Dr. Amadeus Arkham]]{{spaced ndash}}The founder of the asylum, Amadeus named the institution after his deceased mother Elizabeth.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Serious\&quot;/&gt;\n* [[Jeremiah Arkham|Dr. Jeremiah Arkham]]{{spaced ndash}}The nephew of [[Amadeus Arkham]].

Cover art of &#39;&#39;Batman: Shadow of the Bat&#39;&#39; #81 (September 1998 DC Comics). Art by Glen Orbik.]]\n\n===&#39;&#39;Batman: The Last Arkham&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|Batman: The Last Arkham}}\n&#39;&#39;Batman: The Last Arkham&#39;&#39; was written by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]; pencils by [[Norm Breyfogle]], originally a four-issue storyline that kicked off the &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]&#39;&#39; series. In it, the old Arkham Asylum is destroyed, to be replaced by a new and more modern facility. The story introduces Jeremiah Arkham, the asylum&#39;s director and nephew of Amadeus Arkham. In an attempt to discover how criminals, specifically Zsasz, keep escaping, Batman has himself committed to the asylum. Jeremiah uses various methods, such as unleashing many patients on Batman at once, in an attempt to gain psychological insight on the vigilante.\n\nThis story makes a few passing references to the events of &#39;&#39;A Serious House on Serious Earth&#39;&#39;, such as Amadeus Arkham taping over the mirror, and his journal is shown early in the story. Jeremiah also mentions his relative&#39;s descent into mental illness.\n\nAn episode of &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; titled \&quot;Dreams in Darkness\&quot;, also about Batman in Arkham, portrays a similar theme, with the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] as the chief villain, also replacing Jeremiah Arkham with a more nondescript administrator, Dr. Bartholemew who is portrayed as na\u00efve rather than sinister.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Arkham Asylum: Living Hell&#39;&#39;===\n&#39;&#39;Arkham Asylum: Living Hell&#39;&#39; was written by [[Dan Slott]], penciled by [[Ryan Sook]] with inks by Sook, [[Wade Von Grawbadger]] and Jim Royal. The series was edited by [[Valerie D&#39;Orazio]]. [[Eric Powell (comic writer)|Eric Powell]] created the painted cover art which appeared on both the original series and graphic novel compilation.\n\nThis six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] and the subsequent trade paperback provided an intricate and multi-layered look at Arkham Asylum from several points of view: director [[Jeremiah Arkham|Dr. Jeremiah Arkham]]; psychiatrist Dr. Anne Carver; the guards, chiefly one Aaron Cash; and the patients. There is a particular focus on previously unknown residents: Jane Doe, a [[wikt:cipher#Noun|cypher]] who assumes the identities of those she kills; Junkyard Dog, a man obsessed with trash; Doodlebug, an artist who uses blood in his paintings; the hulking bruiser Lunkhead; Death Rattle, a [[cult]] leader who speaks to the dead; and [[Humpty Dumpty (comics)|Humpty Dumpty]], an [[obese]] [[Savant syndrome|idiot savant]] obsessed with taking apart and repairing various objects. The driving force is the recent admission of a ruthless investor, [[Great White Shark (comics)|Warren \&quot;The Great White Shark\&quot; White]], as well as the [[demon]]ic element suggested by the title. White, facing charges of massive [[fraud]], [[insanity plea|pleads insanity]] to avoid being sent to prison, knowing he can bribe a Gotham jury. The judge sees through White&#39;s attempt to avoid prison and has White admitted to Arkham, which White himself had never even heard of up until that point. He soon realizes the horrors of the place and tries to survive. Ultimately, he is locked in Mr. Freeze&#39;s cell and loses his nose and his lips to frostbite while trapped in there, coming to resemble his nickname. He was originally referred to as &#39;Fish&#39; as new inmates commonly are, but is re-dubbed &#39;The Great White Shark&#39; by himself. The demonic threat is nullified after the sacrifice of several patients, thanks to the joint effort of [[Etrigan the Demon]] and White tricking the demons into sending themselves back to the Underworld.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Black Orchid&#39;&#39;===\n&#39;&#39;[[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]]&#39;&#39;, written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and illustrated by [[Dave McKean]], also featured Arkham Asylum. The award-winning graphic novel introduced an updated version of the crimefighter [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]], who dies, is reborn and starts a quest to find her identity. During this she encounters Batman, who directs her to Arkham Asylum, where she meets the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], Two-Face and the Joker. Arkham is viewed as a desperate place where patients dwell in terror, much in the same fashion as in &#39;&#39;A Serious House on Serious Earth&#39;&#39;, which was also illustrated by McKean.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Arkham Reborn&#39;&#39;===\n&#39;&#39;Arkham Reborn&#39;&#39; is a three-part miniseries written by [[David Hine]] and illustrated by Jeremy Haun. It tells the story of the rebuilding of the Asylum after having been destroyed by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the events of \&quot;Battle for the Cowl\&quot;.\n\nIn &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; #697, it is revealed that Dr. Jeremiah Arkham is the new Black Mask. More is revealed about Dr. Jeremiah Arkham in &#39;&#39;Detective Comics&#39;&#39; #864 and #865.\n\n===&#39;&#39;Batman: The Man Who Laughs&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|Batman: The Man Who Laughs}}\n&#39;&#39;The Man Who Laughs&#39;&#39; is a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[prestige format]] [[comic book]] written by [[Ed Brubaker]] and illustrated by [[Doug Mahnke]] and [[Patrick Zircher]], released in February 2005. The comic reveals some of the asylum&#39;s dark history. As a reporter reports on the asylum&#39;s renovation, the Joker poisons her and the crew, stealing the news van to broadcast whenever he wants. He later releases criminally insane patients at Williams Medical Center, who, in a short number of weeks, would have been transferred to Arkham Asylum. In the end, Joker is defeated and he himself is locked behind bars, in a [[straitjacket]] at Arkham.\n\n{{anchor|Made of Wood}}\nThe graphic novel was reprinted with &#39;&#39;[[Detective Comics]]&#39;&#39; #784-786\u2013a storyline entitled \&quot;Made of Wood,\&quot; also written by Brubaker with art by Zircher. In the storyline, [[Batman]] and [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]] track the \&quot;Made of Wood\&quot; serial killer, whose killing spree was cut short when he was admitted to Arkham Asylum. Ex-Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] is also pursuing the killer and he narrows the search down to the two men admitted to Arkham in December 1948, the only living one hardly able to walk and ignorant of the killings. Gordon reaches the grandson of the other, who has taken up the \&quot;Made of Wood\&quot; killer&#39;s mantle.\n\n==Alternative versions==\n\n===&#39;&#39;The Dark Knight Returns&#39;&#39;===\n{{Main|The Dark Knight Returns}}\n&#39;&#39;The Dark Knight Returns&#39;&#39;, written by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], takes place about 10 years after Batman \&quot;retires.\&quot; It depicts an \&quot;Arkham Home for the Emotionally Troubled\&quot;, presumably a renaming of the asylum which occurs as a result of changing attitudes towards mental health. The Joker is housed there, [[catatonia|catatonic]] since Batman&#39;s disappearance, but awakens when the vigilante resumes action. Under the employ of the home is Bartholemew Wolper, a condescending [[psychology|psychologist]] who treats the Joker humanely, even going so far to arrange for him to appear on a late night talk show, while arguing that Batman himself is responsible for the crimes his enemies commit by encouraging their existence; Wolper is killed when the Joker uses his lethal gas on the talk show audience.\n\nIn the sequel &#39;&#39;[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]&#39;&#39;, it is revealed that the patients have taken over and have resorted to [[cannibalism]]. [[Plastic Man]] is one of the more notable patients in this version of Arkham Asylum.\n\n===&#39;&#39;JLA: The Nail&#39;&#39;===\nIn &#39;&#39;[[JLA: The Nail series|JLA: The Nail]]&#39;&#39;, the Joker-using Kryptonian gauntlets provided by a genetically augmented [[Jimmy Olsen]]-breaks into the Asylum, erecting a forcefield around it that prevents anyone but Batman, Robin and Batgirl from entering, while forcing the rest of the patients to fight each other for a chance to live as his slave when only one is left standing. Catwoman wins the resulting conflict shortly before Batman breaks into the asylum, but the Joker&#39;s gauntlets allow him to capture Batman, forcing him to watch as the Joker brutally tears Robin and Batgirl apart in front of him. Although Catwoman manages to distract the Joker long enough for Batman to escape and damage his gauntlets, the grief-maddened Batman subsequently beats the Joker to death on the asylum roof before the entire building collapses, apparently killing most of the current patients (although he and Catwoman manage to escape, Batman is only tried for the Joker&#39;s death once the immediate crisis is resolved, and the sequel confirms that at least Poison Ivy survived the collapse).\n\n===&#39;&#39;Batman: Crimson Mist&#39;&#39;===\nIn &#39;&#39;Batman: Crimson Mist&#39;&#39;, the third part of the trilogy that began with &#39;&#39;[[Batman &amp; Dracula: Red Rain]]&#39;&#39;, the now-vampiric Batman, corrupted by his thirst for blood, breaks into the asylum and murders all the homicidal patients-including [[Amygdala (comics)|Amygdala]], [[Victor Zsasz]] and the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]]-drinking their blood and chopping off their heads to prevent them coming back as vampires (it is unclear if he did this while reveling in his new power or to try and provoke his old allies into destroying what he had become).\n\n==In other media==\nAs an integral part of the Batman franchise, Arkham Asylum has been featured in other media besides the print comics, including the following:\n\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n* Arkham Asylum is mentioned by Barry Allen, who is secretly the [[Flash (DC Comics character)|Flash]], in an episode of the 1990 television series &#39;&#39;[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]&#39;&#39;.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in the 2002 television series &#39;&#39;[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]&#39;&#39;.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in &#39;&#39;[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/gotham-showrunner-professor-hugo-strange-and-how-arkham-asylum-came-to-be-part-of-season-one|title=GOTHAM SHOWRUNNER: PROFESSOR HUGO STRANGE AND HOW ARKHAM ASYLUM CAME TO BE PART OF SEASON ONE|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|work=IGN|date=July 21, 2014|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is established that Arkham Asylum was closed down for 15 years prior to the events of the series. In \&quot;[[Arkham (Gotham)|Arkham]],\&quot; Arkham Asylum is shown to be in the Arkham District as Mayor Aubrey James plans to improve the district using the plans that Thomas Wayne was going to go with. [[Carmine Falcone]] and [[Sal Maroni]] were also shown to want some involvement in the plan. Maroni&#39;s ally Councilman Zeller has been abducted by the same hitman who killed Councilman Ron Jenkins (who was an ally of Falcone) and is burned alive at Arkham Asylum. At the end of the episode, Mayor James holds a press conference that Falcone will handle the small housing developments in the Arkham District, while Maroni will refurbish Arkham Asylum so that it can be operational again. Around the end of \&quot;Harvey Dent,\&quot; Arkham Asylum is officially reopened where insane bomb maker Ian Hargrove is amongst its latest patients after being rescued from the Russian mob by James Gordon and the Gotham City Police Department. In the aftermath of \&quot;LoveCraft,\&quot; James Gordon is reassigned to guard duty at Arkham Asylum by Mayor Aubrey James. In the follow-up episodes, Gordon makes the acquaintance of Dr. [[Leslie Thompkins]] while dealing with an escaped inmate named [[Electrocutioner|Jack Buchinsky]] who is on a quest to get revenge on [[Sal Maroni]] for setting him up. It is this escape that Gordon uses to get back in the GCPD by promising Commissioner Loeb that he can catch Buchinsky and his accomplice Aaron Danzing. In the second season, Theo Galavan has his sister [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tabitha Galavan]] break up several Arkham inmates to serve in his plan, including [[James Gordon (comics)#Barbara Eileen-Gordon|Barbara Kean]], [[Jerome Valeska]], Richard Sionis, [[Amygdala (comics)|Aaron Helzinger]], Robert Greenwood, and Arnold Dobkins. After Galavan&#39;s death, his corpse was taken to an laboratory under Arkham Asylum where the bodies of those like Fish Mooney and Jerome are being kept. This area of the asylum is overseen by Hugo Strange, who conducts various inhuman experiments that include reviving the dead. [[Riddler|Edward Nygma]] is sent here after his crimes are discovered by the GCPD. However, he is later released and declared sane by request of [[Oswald Cobblepot (Gotham)|Penguin]]. During the fourth season, Jerome orchestrates a prison break with Scarecrow and Jervis Tetch to begin his search for his brother Jeremiah Valeska. In the series finale \&quot;[[The Beginning...]]\&quot;, which takes place in the distant future, it is revealed that the Riddler and Jeremiah Valeska have been in Arkham Asylum for the past decade, latter one seemingly brain dead after the accident at Ace Chemicals.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in the TV series set in the [[Arrowverse]]:\n** Arkham Asylum appears in the second of the three-part Arrowverse crossover &#39;&#39;[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]&#39;&#39; In the crossover, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], and Green Arrow travel to Arkham Asylum to find [[Doctor Destiny|Dr. John Deegan]], an insane doctor who was given the means to alter reality by [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]]. Psycho-Pirate and Nora Fries are shown as the notable inmates when Deegan releases all the inmates on Green Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, and [[Killer Frost]]. By the end of the crossover, Deegan is remanded to Arkham Asylum and has his cell next to Psycho-Pirate&#39;s cell.\n** Arkham Asylum is featured in &#39;&#39;[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]&#39;&#39;. In the episode \&quot;The Rabbit Hole,\&quot; Jacob Kane arranges for [[Beth Kane|Alice]] to be sent to Arkham. The transportation was crashed by a bomb made by Catherine Hamilton-Kane&#39;s company. In the episode \&quot;Down Down Down,\&quot; Tommy Elliot is remanded to Arkham Asylum after his plot to draw out Batman fails and Kate states that he can&#39;t buy his way out of Arkham Asylum. In the episode \&quot;Mine Is a Long and a Sad Tale,\&quot; it was mentioned that Alice&#39;s brother figure Mouse had escaped from Arkham Asylum.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in the season one finale of &#39;&#39;[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]&#39;&#39;, titled \&quot;Dick Grayson.\&quot; It appears in a dream world created by [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]] where Dick experiences a dark future where Batman started killing his enemies.\n\n====Animation====\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | width     = 200\n | image1    = Batman Arkham Asylum Television Credits.jpg\n | caption1  = Arkham Asylum as it appeared on &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[The New Batman Adventures]]&#39;&#39;.\n | image2    = Image-Arkham 10.PNG\n | caption2  = The alternate Arkham Asylum as it appeared on the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]&#39;&#39; episode &#39;&#39;A Better World, Part 2&#39;&#39;.\n}}\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Animated Series]]&#39;&#39;, Arkham has appeared frequently throughout the series. The episode \&quot;The Trial\&quot; explains that all mentally ill criminals apprehended by the Batman are sent to Arkham rather than jail.\n* The television show &#39;&#39;[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]&#39;&#39; featured Arkham in a brief [[cameo role|cameo]] during &#39;&#39;A Better World, Part 2&#39;&#39; in an alternate dimension where a [[fascist]] version of the League called the [[Justice Lords]] took over the world and dispatches villains via execution or [[lobotomy]] via [[Superman]]&#39;s heat vision. The asylum is run by a lobotomized version of the Joker, staffed by other lobotomized villains from Batman&#39;s rogues&#39; gallery, and protected by robotic copies of Superman.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in &#39;&#39;[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]&#39;&#39;. Like the original Arkham, several major villains end up in this institution, such as the Joker, Harley Quinn, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze, the Ventriloquist, Hugo Strange, Clayface, and Penguin. The staff is far more heavily armored than in its previous incarnation, though patients continue to easily escape. Similar to the &#39;&#39;Batman Forever&#39;&#39; tie-in game and &#39;&#39;Batman Begins&#39;&#39;, Arkham is presented as occupying a small island on a river inside Gotham.\n* Arkham Asylum is seen in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Mayhem of the Music Meister\&quot;. The eponymous villain visits the place and uses his powers to force the patients to sing. [[Calendar Man]], Joker, King Tut, [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Psycho-Pirate]], [[Doctor Polaris]], [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], Two-Face, [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Top (comics)|Top]], [[Crazy Quilt]], and [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee (comics)|Tweedledum and Tweedledee]] are shown as patients of Arkham Asylum.\n* Arkham Asylum is referred to in &#39;&#39;[[Beware the Batman]]&#39;&#39; in a newspaper article and on a news ticker.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in [[DC Universe]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]&#39;&#39; adult animated series. In the series premiere, \&quot;Til Death Do Us Part\&quot;, the show&#39;s [[Harley Quinn|titular character]] is imprisoned there for a year, until she finally escapes with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]&#39;s help after she caused a prison riot. In \&quot;The Line\&quot;, the [[Queen of Fables]] is transferred to Arkham from her imprisonment within a U.S. Master Tax Guide Book following a court order that deemed the latter to be a cruel and unusual punishment, though she is quickly broken out by Harley Quinn. In \&quot;All the Best Inmates Have Daddy Issues\&quot;, a flashback depicts Harley&#39;s first meeting with both the Joker and Ivy during her time as a psychiatrist at Arkham, while trying to help Harvey Dent and [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] locate a bomb hidden by the Joker. In the season 2 finale, \&quot;The Runaway Bridesmaid\&quot;, Harley is briefly imprisoned at Arkham and escapes after teaming up with Two-Face. Throughout the series, notable patients at Arkham include Harley, Poison Ivy, the Joker, the Riddler, Calendar Man, [[Killer Croc]], [[Man-Bat]], [[KGBeast]], Two-Face, and [[Doctor Psycho]].\n\n===Films===\n====Live-action====\n&lt;!-- did not appear in &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;Batman Returns&#39;&#39; --&gt;\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Batman Forever]]&#39;&#39;, Arkham Asylum was seen at the end of the film. It is designed as a tall, spiraling castle-like structure with narrow hallways lined with brightly lit glass bricks. The Riddler is incarcerated in a large padded cell. The chief psychiatrist is named Doctor Burton, a reference to [[Tim Burton]], who directed 1989&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]&#39;&#39; and 1992&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Batman Returns]]&#39;&#39;. There was originally a more in-depth sequence involving Two-Face escaping from Arkham at the beginning of the film, but it was cut.\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]&#39;&#39;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/batman-and-robin.html |title=Review of &#39;&amp;#39;Batman &amp; Robin&#39;&amp;#39; |publisher=DVD Active.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arkham Asylum is shown a number of times. It first appears when Mr. Freeze is taken there midway through the film and later at the end when he and Poison Ivy are shown sharing a room. This version is several dozen stories tall on an island several hundred feet above water, into which the patients jump to escape. Lightning also emits a bright green flash through the structure&#39;s windows. In addition, the Riddler and Two-Face&#39;s costumes from &#39;&#39;[[Batman Forever]]&#39;&#39; can be seen in an evidence room before Bane breaks out to collect Mr. Freeze&#39;s armor.\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Batman Begins]]&#39;&#39;, Arkham plays a much larger role than the previous films, with [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]] (also known as the Scarecrow) being either the administrator or a high-ranking doctor at the asylum and using it to conduct sadistic experiments with his fear gas, with his own patients as [[guinea pig]]s. He also uses the pipes under the asylum to empty his toxin into the Gotham water supply. Though still on an island separate from Gotham City&#39;s mainland, it is surrounded by a [[slum]] region known as the Narrows, instead of the dense forestry of the comics. When it came to a diversion for the fear gas to infect Gotham&#39;s water supply, Ra&#39;s al Ghul had his men discharge all the patients at Arkham Asylum to keep the police busy. By the end of the film, it is implied that the Narrows has been rendered uninhabitable. Notably, [[Victor Zsasz]] is shown as a high-profile criminal being held in the asylum. The [[National Institute for Medical Research]], Mill Hill, London was used as Arkham in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/606532.0/?utag=8269|title=From leafy suburbs to silver screen|website=Times Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Arkham is mentioned briefly by Harvey Dent, Batman, and [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] in the &#39;&#39;Batman Begins&#39;&#39; sequel, &#39;&#39;[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]&#39;&#39; when they reference Arkham patients Carmine Falcone and Thomas Schiff, but beyond this instance the asylum is never seen or explored in the story.\n* In &#39;&#39;[[The Dark Knight Rises]]&#39;&#39;, it is mentioned that all the patients of Arkham Asylum ([[Joker (The Dark Knight)|except for one]] according to the film&#39;s novelization) were moved to the [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] as the result of the effect of [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]]&#39;s death had upon [[Gotham City]] and its administration.\n* At the end of &#39;&#39;[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]: Ultimate Edition&#39;&#39;, Batman reveals to [[Lex Luthor]] that he has made arrangements for Luthor to be transferred to Arkham Asylum.\n* Arkham appears in a flashback for &#39;&#39;[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DavidAyerMovies/status/581602129615405056|title=David Ayer on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Arkham appears in &#39;&#39;[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]&#39;&#39; in a post-credits scene where [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson / Deathstroke]] meets [[Lex Luthor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://batman-news.com/2017/01/04/lex-luthor-justice-league-arkham-asylum/|title=Lex Luthor in \u2018Justice League\u2019 means we\u2019re taking a trip to Arkham Asylum|publisher=Batman on Film|last=Begley|first=Chris|date=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Arkham Asylum, renamed &#39;&#39;&#39;Arkham State Hospital&#39;&#39;&#39;, appears in &#39;&#39;[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]&#39;&#39; where Arthur Fleck steals a document about his mother, revealing a history of mental instabilities.\n\n====Animation====\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]&#39;&#39;, the final battle between the original Batman and the Joker is seen taking place at an abandoned Arkham. It is also the same spot where [[Tim Drake|Robin]], [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] and disfigured into resembling a younger version of the Joker, kills the real Joker (either by shooting him with the bang-flag speargun or by pushing him into a tank of water and a mass of wires, causing him to electrocute himself, depending on which version is being seen). A deleted scene, featured on both versions of the DVD as a special feature, has Bruce Wayne touring the abandoned Arkham, where Bruce Wayne&#39;s successor as Batman, [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]], follows and sees the Joker&#39;s corpse hanging with a sign on it saying \&quot;I Know\&quot;. Both the film and the &#39;&#39;Batman Beyond&#39;&#39; episode \&quot;Splicer\&quot; suggest that the facility has moved to a different location.\n* Arkham makes an appearance in the animated anthology film &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]&#39;&#39; (set between &#39;&#39;[[Batman Begins]]&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]&#39;&#39;) within the segment \&quot;Crossfire\&quot;. Expanding on Lt. James Gordon&#39;s line that \&quot;the Narrows is lost\&quot; at the end of &#39;&#39;Batman Begins&#39;&#39;, the film shows that the entire island has become Arkham Asylum&#39;s ground, with Narrows residents evacuated from the island after the patients escaped from the facility. After the riot at the end of &#39;&#39;Batman Begins&#39;&#39;, the city apparently turned the entire island into a high-tech prison facility in a few months after the incident, enclosed by guard towers, high fences, and the island&#39;s natural barrier to keep the inmates from escaping. The [[Gotham City Police Department]] also sends officers to its drawbridges to make sure no one would cross, in or out, without permission.\n* Arkham is featured in the animated film &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]&#39;&#39;.

They released Joker, Harely Quinn, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, Two-Face, Scarecrow, and Bane and used the mutagen on them to turn them into mutants. Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and the Turtles arrived to the handle the situation, though they defeated and subdue and rescue the surviving staff, Joker injected Batman with a mix of the mutagen and Joker venom to turn him into a mutant bat. They managed to subdue Batman and turn him back to normal, it was later revealed that Shredder and Ra&#39;s al Ghul&#39;s real plan was to turn everyone in Gotham into mutants using mutagen mass-produced from Ace Chemicals.\n\n===Video games===\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Batman Forever (video game)|Batman Forever]]&#39;&#39; ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game), Arkham Asylum is the first stage.\n* In the game &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Toxic Chill]]&#39;&#39;, [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] are taken to \&quot;Arkham\&quot; by [[Riddler]] and his companion [[Mr. Freeze]] and define them in the same room.\n* A crucial showdown takes place in Arkham in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]&#39;&#39;.\n* Arkham is featured prominently in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]&#39;&#39;.

In Episode 5, [[Vicki Vale|Lady Arkham]] stages a prison breakout that is stopped by Batman, the staff (including Dr. Joan Leland) and the GCPD. Noticeable patients in this version are \&quot;[[Joker (character)|John Doe]]\&quot;, [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Arnold Wesker]], [[Victor Zsasz]], [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], and Harvey Dent (only if Batman chose to stop him and send him here in Episode 4).\n\n====&#39;&#39;Lego&#39;&#39; series====\n* Arkham Asylum works as the main hub for the villains in &#39;&#39;[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]&#39;&#39;, whereas the [[Batcave]] works as the main hub for the heroes of the game.\n* Arkham Asylum appears in &#39;&#39;[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]&#39;&#39;.

They are able to break out with the assistance of [[Livewire (comics)|Livewire]], but she and Joker are recaptured by Professor Hugo Strange and used to test his monster-men (inmates he&#39;s experimented on), but they escape.\n\n====Batman: Arkham series====\n* &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]&#39;&#39; is a video game for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was developed by [[Rocksteady Studios]] and published by [[Eidos Interactive]] in conjunction with [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] and DC Comics. The game takes place entirely on Arkham Island, a large island on the middle of the Gotham bay. The game&#39;s version of Arkham is similar to its description in &#39;&#39;Gotham Knight&#39;&#39;, consisting of individual large buildings in a spacious open air island, rather than a single compound. Its locations include Arkham East, Arkham West, Arkham North, Arkham Mansion and the Botanical Gardens, Intensive Treatment, Medical Facility and Penitentiary. The island also features a network of catacombs, caverns, sewers, and a satellite [[Batcave]] which Batman had outfitted over the years in preparation for emergencies like the one he faces in the game. In the game, a fire had broke out at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] causing its inmates to be temporarily housed at Arkham. When Joker was apprehended, he was freed by Harley Quinn as Joker begins his plot to take over Arkham Asylum, forcing Batman to fight his way through the Asylum inmates to recapture the Joker. During the struggle, the Asylum is badly damaged by the rampaging inmates and the Joker&#39;s release of Titan into the water supply enhancing and mutating Poison Ivy&#39;s plants, as well as faith in the asylum being compromised with the discovery that key guards and staff were working with the Joker to organize his assault (Although Doctor Penelope Young was merely manipulated by the Joker rather than acting as a willing accomplice).\n* In &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham City]]&#39;&#39;, the sequel to &#39;&#39;Batman: Arkham Asylum&#39;&#39;, Arkham and Blackgate inmates have been relocated to the Gotham mainland as part of Quincy Sharp&#39;s Arkham City project with neither Blackgate Penitentiary or Arkham Asylum in any condition to hold inmates or patients after it was ravaged by Poison Ivy in the first game. Arkham City is a walled off section of Gotham North where its inmates can run free in exchange that they do not escape; this territory includes the old GCPD building and the Monarch Theatre where Thomas and Martha Wayne were killed. The security of Arkham City is enforced by the private military security group TYGER, with territory controlled by the Joker, Penguin, and Two-Face as the City&#39;s primary ganglords (although Two-Face has been losing authority prior to the start of the game), with Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy satisfied with control of specific buildings. Riddler discreetly controlled members of the others&#39; gangs, and Catwoman, Bane and Zsasz operated independently in secret. Arkham Asylum itself can be seen from the bay of Arkham City, still ravaged and covered in vines from Poison Ivy&#39;s attack.\n* Arkham Asylum is mentioned in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]&#39;&#39; (a prequel to &#39;&#39;Batman: Arkham Asylum&#39;&#39;). At the time of the game, the asylum had been closed for years, with Blackgate taking all the city&#39;s criminals\u2014mentally ill and otherwise. During the credits, Jack Ryder&#39;s interview with Quincy Sharp has mentioned that in wake of the recent events Arkham Asylum has been reopened. Sharp decided the asylum is necessary to house the new wave of Gotham&#39;s most mentally ill criminals such as the Joker. However, revealed in Shiva&#39;s extortion file she, per the orders of Ra&#39;s al Ghul, manipulated Sharp into opening the Asylum as part of a long-term plan that led to Arkham City&#39;s creation.\n* The Asylum is referenced again in &#39;&#39;[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]&#39;&#39;, where Jason Todd is revealed to have been held hostage and tortured by Joker over a year in an abandoned wing of the Asylum while Batman believed he was dead. Arkham City was once more reintegrated into Gotham City and is currently under reconstruction, sponsored by Wayne Enterprises. Arkham Island and the Arkham City area can be seen from the top of Wayne Tower looking out over the bay. Prior to the events of the game, Scarecrow, announces a meeting to Gotham&#39;s most notorious supervillains, including Two-Face, the Penguin, the Riddler, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy and the Arkham Knight, held in Arkham Asylum, where it is strongly guarded by military soldiers and drones. In one of the Gotham City Stories, Catwoman tried to infiltrate the meeting, but is spotted by one of the drones. The final confrontation between Batman and Scarecrow takes place in the ruined Asylum, with Jason Todd saving Batman from Scarecrow&#39;s control.\n\n====Injustice====\n* Arkham Asylum is a playable stage in the fighting game &#39;&#39;[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]&#39;&#39;. It features multiple Batman villains in the background who also damage the characters in stage transitions. An alternate version of the stage is called Joker&#39;s Asylum, taking place in the alternate universe seen in the story where the Joker Clan has taken over the establishment.\n* Arkham Asylum returns as a stage in &#39;&#39;[[Injustice 2]]&#39;&#39;.\n\n==See also==\n* Belle Reve\n* [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]\n* [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]]\n* [[Stryker&#39;s Island]]\n* [[Ravencroft]]\n\n== Notes ==\n&lt;references group=\&quot;nb\&quot; /&gt;\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.arkhamcare.com Arkham Care]\n* [http://www.batman-on-film.com/comics_arkham-asylum_review_jett_2007.html Batman-On-Film.com] BOF&#39;s review of Arkham Asylum, A Serious House on a Serious Earth\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090629085913/http://www.batmanarkhamasylum.com/ Official Videogame Website]\n\n{{Batman}}\n\n[[Category:Arkham Asylum| ]]\n[[Category:Psychiatric hospitals in fiction]]\n[[Category:1974 in comics]]\n[[Category:DC Comics prisons]]\n\n[[fr:Gotham City#L&#39;asile d&#39;Arkham]]&quot;</span>
