Created by writer [[Louise Simonson]] and artist [[June Brigman]], they first appeared in their own [[ongoing series|series]] in 1984, which lasted 62 issues, and have since appeared in other books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nPower Pack is the first team of preteen superheroes in the Marvel Universe and the first in comics to operate without adult supervision. The title retains a cult following and in 2005 was relaunched as a title aimed at younger readers\u2014though this was eventually declared a separate continuity from that of the original series.\n\n==Publication history==\n===Original series===\n[[Image:Powerpackad.jpg|thumb|right|Advertisement for the debut of the team&#39;s comic book (1984)]]\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Marvel Comics had a policy that all their editors should also be writers. Despite this, [[Louise Simonson]] recalled, {{quote|I had resisted [[Jim Shooter|Shooter]]&#39;s encouragement to write stuff or do freelance stuff because I thought he had writers whose livelihoods depended on their doing books and it didn&#39;t feel fair to take the work away from them. I had a job. But then Shooter hired a whole batch of new editors, and my workload was cut in half. I got bored and I thought I should create something rather than take one of the jobs that were already there, so I proposed the idea for \&quot;Power Pack\&quot; to Shooter. He eventually loved the idea, and so that was my taste of writing. I found it more challenging than editing, and way more fun, because I had been editing for a long time so I think it had gotten too easy for me.&lt;ref name=\&quot;GenRoles\&quot;&gt;(March 8, 2013). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=44169 Women in Comics: Simonson, Nocenti Talk Marvel &amp; Gender Roles in Comics], Comic Book Resources.&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\nSimonson chose [[June Brigman]] as Power Pack&#39;s penciler because of her talent for drawing children.&lt;ref name=\&quot;GenRoles\&quot;/&gt; The &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; series premiered in May 1984 (cover date August 1984) in a double issue inked by [[Bob Wiacek]].&lt;ref&gt;Marvel Comics&#39; original advertisement, indicating a May 1, 1984 release date&lt;/ref&gt; The series continued through early 1991, during which time Brigman and Wiacek were replaced by [[Jon Bogdanove]] and [[Hilary Barta]] as principal artists, and Bogdanove eventually took over as writer.\n\nDramatic changes were made to the series&#39; art and storylines in [[1990 in comics|1990]], when Michael Higgins and Tom Morgan were brought in to make the comic edgier and more adult beginning with issue #56. The changes were largely reviled by &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; readers, and the series was canceled six months later with issue #62. A year and a half after the cancellation of the series, creators Louise Simonson and June Brigman teamed up on the &#39;&#39;Power Pack Holiday Special&#39;&#39;, which undid all of the plotlines started by Michael Higgins.\n\nThe &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; strips were reprinted by [[Marvel UK]] beginning around [[1986 in comics|1986]]. It was Marvel UK&#39;s practice at the time to use a less well-known series as a second strip in a comic devoted to more recognizable characters, and &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; became the \&quot;back-up strip\&quot; in a run of Marvel&#39;s licensed &#39;&#39;[[Star Wars]]&#39;&#39; weekly &#39;&#39;[[Return of the Jedi]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rebelscum.com/photo.asp?image=/comics/mvukrotjw082.jpg&amp;text=Star%20Wars:%20Return%20of%20the%20Jedi%20Weekly%2082 |title=cover of UK Star Wars comic showing Power Pack as back up strip |publisher=Rebelscum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period it was printed partly in black and white and partly in color, as was the main &#39;&#39;Star Wars&#39;&#39; strip. &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; subsequently became the back-up strip for the &#39;&#39;[[ThunderCats (comics)|ThunderCats]]&#39;&#39; comic, where it remained until its eventual replacement with the &#39;&#39;[[Galaxy Rangers]]&#39;&#39; series.\n\n===Themes of the original series===\nWhile the characters of &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; were children, the series often dealt with mature issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/powerpak.htm |title=Power Pack}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the social problems of the eighties found their way into the book&#39;s storylines. Among the themes addressed were pollution,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #48\u201349&lt;/ref&gt; drug abuse,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #7\u20138, #29\u201332&lt;/ref&gt; runaways,&lt;ref name=ppcad&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack/Cloak and Dagger: Shelter from the Storm&#39;&#39; (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; kidnapping,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #12, #14, #20, #22\u201326, #39\u201340; &#39;&#39;Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; 195&lt;/ref&gt; [[gun violence]],&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #29, #30&lt;/ref&gt; bullying,&lt;ref name=\&quot;PPVol1-28\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #38&lt;/ref&gt; orphanhood,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; 18\u201320, 27&lt;/ref&gt; and [[homelessness]].&lt;ref name=ppcad/&gt;\n\nA major ongoing theme of the series was the relationship between Power Pack and their parents, Jim and Maggie. Unlike superheroes such as [[Spider-Man]] or [[Batman]], the Power children were not \&quot;conveniently\&quot; orphaned and alone; instead, they were part of a loving and supportive family. In spite of this, they decided early in the series to keep their powers and superhero activities completely concealed from their parents. Keeping their powers secret sometimes led the members of Power Pack to deceive their family and friends and to feel guilty about doing so. For instance, in one incident, Julie was forced to allow her school friends to be beaten up by bullies instead of using her powers to defend them.&lt;ref name=\&quot;PPVol1-28\&quot;/&gt; The question of whether or not the powers should be revealed was also an ongoing source of debate among the children. Jack, for instance, found it \&quot;cool\&quot; to have a secret,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #33&lt;/ref&gt; while the older and more responsible Julie, who had originally suggested that the powers be concealed from their parents,&lt;ref name=pp5&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #5&lt;/ref&gt; quickly reversed her opinion and felt that they needed to be told sooner or later. &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; readers also argued the matter out in the letter pages.\n\nThe writers also emphasized that the Pack had to learn to deal with their powers\u2014and their lethal potential\u2014responsibly. In one early issue, Jack was wracked with remorse when he thought he had killed a man.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #8&lt;/ref&gt; In a later story arc, Katie dealt with immense guilt, called herself a \&quot;monster\&quot;, and wanted to die after she saw how severely she had injured the Snark prince Jakal.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #23\u201325&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn 1984, Power Pack was featured with [[Spider-Man]] in a special comic designed to fight sexual abuse. The one-shot issue, written by Louise Simonson, was distributed free and reprinted in the comics sections of many major newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack and Spider-Man&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt; Marvel continued the campaign by featuring the characters in print [[public service announcement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #23&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, when the Pack was kidnapped during the Snark Wars, the writers used the storyline to address the issue of [[child abduction]] and printed photos of missing children in lieu of the comic&#39;s regular [[Comic book letter column|letters column]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #22\u201326&lt;/ref&gt; While one-shot public service issues are typically non-canonical, Spider-Man&#39;s childhood sexual abuse was mentioned in other issues, with a reference to this comic, leading some to believe Power Pack confronted this in canon, also. In 1989, the team was featured with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] in a special graphic novel, which addressed the issues of teen homelessness and runaways. Hotline telephone numbers for [[Covenant House]] were printed on the back cover for readers seeking help.&lt;ref name=ppcad/&gt;\n\nThe Power Pack letters column, titled \&quot;Pick of the Pack\&quot;, printed drawings and jokes about the characters submitted by readers, an unusual practice for a Marvel title.\n\n===2000 miniseries===\nIn 2000, a four-part Power Pack mini-series was released. In this series, the kids&#39; ages had advanced a few years: Katie was now in the fifth grade (having skipped two grades due to her intelligence), Julie and Jack were in junior high, and Alex was in high school. James and Maggie, the children&#39;s parents, had at some time learned about Power Pack. The Powers now wore masks on their adventures, which, by and large, were restricted to \&quot;practice sessions\&quot; in the forests around their home in [[Bainbridge Island, Washington|Bainbridge Island]], {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} from [[Seattle]]. The series once again pitted the Pack against Queen Mauraud and the Snarks in outer space.\n\n===Return of Power Pack===\n[[Joe Quesada]] announced in a &#39;&#39;New Joe Fridays&#39;&#39; column at [[Newsarama]] that Power Pack would be returning to the Marvel Universe in late 2007, after the events of &#39;&#39;Civil War&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays24.html NEWSARAMA.COM: NEW JOE FRIDAYS&amp;nbsp;\u2013 WEEK 24, A WEEKLY Q&amp;A WITH JOE QUESADA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210011306/http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays24.html |date=December 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays35.html NEWSARAMA.COM: NEW JOE FRIDAYS&amp;nbsp;\u2013 WEEK 35, A WEEKLY Q&amp;A WITH JOE QUESADA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218072744/http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays35.html |date=February 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the various delays within their release shipping schedules for Marvel Comics, Power Pack&#39;s was delayed. A new Power Pack story was commissioned for the 2007 Marvel Holiday Special,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Holiday Special&#39;&#39; 2007&amp;nbsp;\u2013 Piece of Cake; Merry Christmas; Secret Santa (Loners story); The Meaning of Christmas&lt;/ref&gt; which would have been the first original material featuring the full cast in the standard Marvel Universe since the 2000 mini-series. It was briefly summarized \&quot;Power Pack relives holidays past\&quot; in official Marvel solicits, but the story was scrapped from the publication at the last minute, when it was decided to prioritize recently canceled title &#39;&#39;The Loners&#39;&#39;, which features Julie Power among its cast. A Loners story written by [[CB Cebulski]] ran in place of the Power Pack strip, though the official publicity release and solicit information still lists the Power Pack story and description.\n\nThree of the Power siblings, Alex, Jack, and Katie, appear within &#39;&#39;[[Fantastic Four]]&#39;&#39; #574 as guests celebrating their former teammate Franklin Richards&#39; birthday.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; #574&lt;/ref&gt; During the story, Alex was invited to join Reed Richards&#39; [[Future Foundation]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Fantastic Four #579\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; #579&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the \&quot;All Hope Lies in Doom\&quot; story arc within the FF series, Power Pack were reunited in helping the Future Foundation utilize the Hub to aid in the battles happening at the Baxter Building.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;FF&#39;&#39; #15&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Fictional team history==\n===At the beginning===\nAlex (age 12),&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julie Power|Julie]] (10),&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Power (Marvel Comics)|Jack]] (8),&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceA\&quot;&gt;Comment from editors in Power Pack #6 \&quot;Pick of the Pack\&quot; letters column: \&quot;Jack is almost nine\&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;ReferenceB\&quot;&gt;Comment from editors in Power Pack #9 \&quot;Pick of the Pack\&quot; letters column, regarding Alex&#39;s \&quot;my brother is almost 8\&quot; comment in issue #6: \&quot;Alex did screw up! Jack is almost nine! Alex was so flustered by meeting Spider-Man that he could hardly talk straight...and boy is Jack mad! He figures it&#39;s no wonder that Spider-Man treated them like babies! He thought Jack was a whole year younger than he is!\&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Katie Power]] (5)&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #16&lt;/ref&gt; were bright, normal American children living with their parents in a beachfront house in [[Virginia]]. Their father, Dr. [[James Power (comics)|James Power]], was a brilliant physicist who discovered a process to generate energy from [[antimatter]] with the assistance of a converter, of which he made a prototype. The process was, however, known to several alien races to cause chain reactions and destroy planets, and Dr. Power&#39;s knowledge of the process was discovered by Aelfyre \&quot;Whitey\&quot; Whitemane, a member of the [[Kymellian]] race, who resemble humanoid horses. A similar accident destroyed the Kymellians&#39; home planet.&lt;ref name=PP1&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhitey tried to stop the experiment by warning the Powers but was mortally wounded by his enemies, the reptilian [[Zn&#39;rx|Snark]]s, in the process. The Snarks kidnapped Dr. Power and his wife, [[Margaret Power|Margaret]], hoping to obtain the secret of antimatter. Whitey rescued the Power children and told them what was happening. Before dying, he passed his powers to them to complete his mission.&lt;ref name=PP1/&gt;\n\nThe children, with the help of Whitey&#39;s \&quot;[[Smartship Friday|smartship]]\&quot;, a [[sentience|sentient]] [[starship]] called Friday, managed to stop the antimatter test by stealing and destroying the converter and rescued their parents from the Snarks. They decided to continue being superheroes and to hide their powers from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #2\u20135&lt;/ref&gt; Alex took the codename &#39;&#39;Gee&#39;&#39;, Julie became &#39;&#39;Lightspeed&#39;&#39;, Jack became &#39;&#39;Mass Master&#39;&#39;, and Katie became &#39;&#39;Energizer&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=PP1/&gt; They wore costumes made for them by Friday, which were actually Kymellian spacesuits. The costumes, which were constructed of unstable molecules and stored &#39;Elsewhere&#39;, could materialize and disappear on voice command.\n\nAfter rescuing their parents, the entire family moves to New York City, where the team attempted to deal with normal \&quot;kid problems\&quot; such as bullies and loose teeth while battling some of the deadliest villains in the Marvel Universe. The Pack fought the villain [[Kurse]] on two occasions during &#39;&#39;[[Secret Wars II]]&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #18; &#39;&#39;Secret Wars II&#39;&#39; #6&lt;/ref&gt; They were also heavily involved in the events of the &#39;&#39;[[Fall of the Mutants]]&#39;&#39;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #35; &#39;&#39;X-Factor&#39;&#39; #25&lt;/ref&gt; and &#39;&#39;[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]&#39;&#39; storylines.&lt;ref name=pp42-44&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #42\u201344&lt;/ref&gt; During the &#39;&#39;[[Mutant Massacre]]&#39;&#39;, they descended into the sewers and fought [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #27&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Pack&#39;s two greatest enemies during the original series were the Snarks and Carmody/The Bogeyman. The Snarks generally attempted to kidnap the Power children and steal their powers.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #3\u20134, 16\u201317, 22\u201325, 50\u201352&lt;/ref&gt; Carmody, James Power&#39;s former employer, spotted the Power children when they stole the antimatter converter at the beginning of the series and became obsessed with revenge.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #2&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he tried to work with government agencies to prove the Powers were mutants.&lt;ref name=pp5/&gt; Later, he became a supervillain himself, assuming the identity of the Bogeyman.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #14\u201315, 37\u201340&lt;/ref&gt; After being thrown into [[Otherplace|Limbo]] by [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] of the [[New Mutants]], he returned in a demonic form and nearly killed the entire Power family before ultimately committing suicide.&lt;ref name=pp42-44/&gt;\n\nPower Pack joined forces with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak &amp; Dagger]],&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #7\u20138, #19; &#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #12\u201314&lt;/ref&gt; the [[X-Men]]&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #12, 27, 35, 44; &#39;&#39;Uncanny X-Men&#39;&#39; #195, #205&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New Mutants]]&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #20, 33, 39\u201340, 44&lt;/ref&gt; on numerous occasions.\n\nThe team took great pains to conceal their superhuman abilities from their family and \&quot;normal\&quot; friends. However, during &#39;&#39;[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]&#39;&#39;, when confronted by the demonic Carmody, the children were forced to reveal their powers to save their parents.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #42&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery led Jim and Maggie to have mental breakdowns. They were restored to normal through the combined efforts of [[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]] and [[Gosamyr]], who convinced them that the super-powered children were clones created to protect them from Carmody and that the \&quot;real\&quot; Power children, who were powerless, had been taken away and guarded by the New Mutants until Carmody was defeated. This explanation placated their parents and, once they were reunited with their \&quot;normal\&quot; children, their minds healed themselves. The \&quot;clones\&quot;, which had been generated by Mirage, were then removed, making the children&#39;s secret safe once again.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Power Pack #44\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #44&lt;/ref&gt; This \&quot;cover-up\&quot; proved to be unpopular with readers, and was highly criticized in the comic&#39;s letters column.\n\nAnother occasional member of the team was [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]], the son of [[Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Invisible Woman]], who went by the name Tattletale while adventuring. James and Margaret Power were introduced to Franklin after the events of the Snark Wars,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #26&lt;/ref&gt; and befriended Reed and Sue Richards when Franklin was returned to [[Avengers Mansion]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #28&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Franklin was often invited to stay with the Power family while his parents were away on missions.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #36&lt;/ref&gt; Although Franklin was a member of the group, the [[Fantastic Four]] had no knowledge of Power Pack until the end of the series; instead, they thought of the Power children simply as \&quot;Franklin&#39;s friends\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #36, 52&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===End of the series===\nSometime later, Alex underwent a transformation into a Kymellian, and Margaret Power began losing her mind.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #56\u201362&lt;/ref&gt; The Power family sought help for Margaret and Alex in various places, beginning with Reed Richards&#39; lab, but their efforts were disrupted by the [[Red Ghost]] and his super apes.\n\nThe Power family traveled to the UK to try to find help for Margaret and Alex, but the institute was overrun by [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] and they encountered Excalibur.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Excalibur&#39;&#39; #29&lt;/ref&gt;. After that the Powers visited the Caribbean. The children planned to enjoy the sun and sand while their father consulted with colleagues but found themselves confronted with what seemed to be an alien attack on the beach where they were relaxing.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Super-Heroes Summer Special 1991&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt;     \n\nThe family decided to abandon New York and fly with Friday to New Kymellia to seek help for Alex and his mother.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Power Pack #62\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #62&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHowever, both Alex and his parents had been replaced by \&quot;pseudoplasm\&quot; doubles by a renegade Kymellian Technocrat and his ally, the exiled Maraud (called Meraud in this storyline). The real Alex and his parents were being held captive in the Technocrat&#39;s hidden satellite orbiting New Kymellia. Eventually, the other Power siblings learned the truth and rescued their family, switching powers several times as needed, and barely escaping from the satellite before it was destroyed by Maraud.&lt;ref name=pphs&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack Holiday Special&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter recovering on New Kymellia, the Power family returned to New York with Friday. Each of the children was back in possession of his or her original power, and their parents remained unaware of their children&#39;s powers and of Power Pack&#39;s existence.&lt;ref name=\&quot;pphs\&quot; /&gt;\n\n==Post-series==\n===Alex, New Warriors and the Future Foundation===\nThe Kymellians had given Alex the ability to absorb the powers of his siblings into himself and thus use them all. With these powers, he joined the [[New Warriors]] superhero group under the name Powerpax, later Powerhouse.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;New Warriors&#39;&#39; #48\u201351, 55\u201357&lt;/ref&gt; This caused some friction with Alex&#39;s brother and sisters; even their parents noticed the heightened levels of hostility and forced the children to see a psychologist. Alex eventually gave the others&#39; powers back; the four reverted to their original names (except Alex, who named himself &#39;&#39;Zero-G&#39;&#39; and Julie, who was now called &#39;&#39;Starstreak&#39;&#39;, the name Katie had chosen when she had Julie&#39;s powers).&lt;ref&gt;Between &#39;&#39;New Warriors&#39;&#39; #75, &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] later tried to recruit Alex back into the New Warriors. Alex politely refused, citing the conflicts his membership would cause among his siblings, though Katie offered her services, to Speedball&#39;s chagrin.&lt;ref name=\&quot;New Warriors vol. 2 1\&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;New Warriors&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) 1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAt some point outside of any published story, their parents discovered that the children had superpowers and were active as superheroes. Why Power Pack&#39;s parents could now retain this information without suffering mental trauma and insanity&amp;nbsp;\u2013 thanks to telepathic manipulation by Byrel Whitemane that had previously been established as impossible to circumvent&amp;nbsp;\u2013 has not been explained.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Power Pack #44\&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Power Pack #62\&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; #50&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nFollowing the events of the 2000 mini-series, Julie left the family home in unrevealed circumstances to try to become an actress in Los Angeles. Despite Julie&#39;s departure from Power Pack, the team defeats [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Man Unlimited&#39;&#39; Vol.3 #12 (November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Katie is later seen in costume having beaten several [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] agents unconscious, when [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]] and [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] offered her membership in the [[Great Lakes Avengers]] but she declined,&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;GLA: Misassembled&#39;&#39; #2 (July 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and Power Pack fight [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]] in [[New Jersey]], a sighting which is used as his [[alibi]] against charges that he robbed [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[She-Hulk]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #6 (May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring Marvel&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]&#39;&#39; event, Alex&#39;s codename Powerhouse was briefly mentioned by [[Hindsight (comics)|Hindsight Lad]], an ex-teammate responsible for outing the secret identities of many New Warriors.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[She-Hulk]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #8 (July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Alex is one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book &#39;&#39;[[Avengers: The Initiative]]&#39;&#39; #1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |title=&#39;&#39;Avengers: The Initiative&#39;&#39; #1 Character Map |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=2013-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521092102/http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |archivedate=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHe later joined Reed Richards&#39; Future Foundation project, which allowed gifted children living within the [[Baxter Building]] to map out the outlook for their generation.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Fantastic Four #579\&quot;/&gt;\n\n===Julie, Excelsior/Loners, Avengers Academy and Future Foundation===\nSometime after the events of the 2000 mini-series, Julie Power concluded that adventuring had deprived her of a normal childhood. She dropped out of high school, left her family, and moved to Los Angeles to become an actress. She joined [[Loners (comics)|Excelsior]], a support group for \&quot;former\&quot; teenage superheroes, where she is once again known as Lightspeed. Excelsior&#39;s first mission was to return the members of the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] to the foster care from which the children had absconded and ended with Excelsior battling [[Ultron]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Runaways&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #1\u20136&lt;/ref&gt; Though they are not seen on-panel, it is then established that Excelsior spend several months attempting to recapture the child cast of the Runaways, but are constantly thwarted by being ineffectual, getting roped into cleaning up after the Runaways&#39; crimefighting exploits, and on occasion simply by being outsmarted by the Runaways.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Runaways&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #6\u201312&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Loners are all registered under the Superhuman Registration Act, but consider themselves retired from super-heroics&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Loners&#39;&#39; #3&lt;/ref&gt; when they are not battling super-powered menaces&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Runaways&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #6&lt;/ref&gt; or operating in public as superheroes attempting to capture runaway super-powered children.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Runaways&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #7&lt;/ref&gt; However, Julie later tells the rest of the group that she is not registered.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Loners&#39;&#39; #5&lt;/ref&gt; While she is less intelligent and articulate than previously established, Julie reveals in &#39;&#39;Loners&#39;&#39; #4 that this is merely an affectation she adopts for the benefit of others&amp;nbsp;\u2013 she pretends to be a \&quot;dumb blonde\&quot; to fit in with Los Angelenos.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39; Loners&#39;&#39; #4&lt;/ref&gt; (It had previously been established that Julie is a redhead, her \&quot;blonde\&quot; hair the result of using light hues in the production of the comic&#39;s art to reflect the brighter climate of the west coast.)\n\nThe Loners&#39; support group has moved to New York City, where Julie is presumably seen, though not named, at recent meetings.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;War of Kings: Darkhawk&#39;&#39; #1\u20132&lt;/ref&gt; As with the cast&#39;s sudden relocation to Los Angeles from New York between the cancellation of their series and the beginning of &#39;&#39;Runaways&#39;&#39; volume 2, the move is not explained.\n\nJulie was seen among the other young superheroes to arrive on the new campus for the [[Avengers Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers Academy&#39;&#39; #20&lt;/ref&gt; where she is attending classes as a teacher assistant, under [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver&#39;s]] tutelage.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Avengers Academy&#39;&#39; #21&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nSometime after Julie ended the relationship with [[Karolina Dean]],&lt;ref&gt;Runaways (Volume 5) #10&lt;/ref&gt; she was dealing with her depression and dropping out of college; when Alex &amp; [[Dragon Man]] appeared in her apartment and recruited her on a rescue mission to help save the Foundation. Afterward, she joined the team as both teacher and Co-leader of the FF.&lt;ref&gt;Fantastic Four (Volume 6) #12&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Members==\nThe Power siblings have changed powers on several occasions and are the core of the Pack.\n\n{| class=\&quot;wikitable\&quot;\n|-\n!

Written by [[Marc Sumerak]] and penciled by [[Gurihiru Studios]], it mostly ignored previous &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; continuity and was aimed toward young children. Marvel later noted that these stories take place on Earth-5631 as opposed to the established mainstream Marvel continuity of Earth-616.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z&#39;&#39; #10&lt;/ref&gt; Although the initial four-issue series was not released under the Marvel Age imprint because of editorial decisions, it was later reprinted in digest format under the Marvel Age banner. Each of these first four issues focussed on one of the Power children and their respective troubles in balancing the secret of their powers with the demands of their daily lives.\n\nA second &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; miniseries by the same creative team, &#39;&#39;X-Men &amp; Power Pack&#39;&#39;, debuted in October 2005. The series guest-starred various members and villains from the [[X-Men]] comics, including [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Mister Sinister]] and his [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. The [[Circus of Crime#Modern day|Circus of Crime]] also makes an appearance.\n\nA third &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; miniseries, titled &#39;&#39;Avengers &amp; Power Pack: Assemble!&#39;&#39; debuted in April 2006. This series teamed the Pack with various members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]: [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Spider-Man]], and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]. Issues #3 &amp; #4 were a two-part adventure in which the Pack and the Avengers battled [[Kang the Conqueror]], although the latter&#39;s plot of conquest which culminates in these two volumes spans the whole miniseries.\n\nA fourth &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; miniseries, titled &#39;&#39;Spider-Man &amp; Power Pack&#39;&#39;, debuted in November 2006. The series featured Spider-Man and some of his rogue&#39;s gallery, such as the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. The miniseries included two sub-plots: in one, Spider-Man was reduced in age and temporarily joined the Power siblings; the second involved the group teaming up with Spidey to capture Venom symbiote costumes that had been taking control of various women \u2013 including [[Mary-Jane Watson]] \u2013 during part one, and then Katie in part two.\n\nA fifth &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; miniseries, &#39;&#39;Hulk &amp; Power Pack&#39;&#39;, debuted in March 2007, following the events of the &#39;&#39;Spider-Man and Power Pack&#39;&#39; miniseries. The series involved the [[Hulk]] and his enemies the [[Absorbing Man]], [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], and [[Zzzax]]. The miniseries was drawn by David Williams (except for issue #3, which was drawn by Andy Kuhn).\n\nA sixth &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; miniseries, &#39;&#39;Fantastic Four &amp; Power Pack&#39;&#39;, debuted in July 2007, co-starring the Fantastic Four, who made a previous appearance in issue #3 of the first &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; miniseries. Gurihiru Studios returned for the artwork; however, [[Fred Van Lente]] replaced Mark Sumerak as writer. The series pitted the Pack against the Fantastic Four&#39;s enemies and also featured Franklin Richards, who, as Tattletale, was a member of Power Pack in the regular Marvel Universe.\n\nA seventh &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; miniseries, &#39;&#39;Iron Man &amp; Power Pack&#39;&#39;, debuted in November 2007, co-starring Iron Man, who had previously appeared in the &#39;&#39;Avengers &amp; Power Pack: Assemble!&#39;&#39; miniseries. The series was written by Marc Sumerak and the artwork was by Marcelo Diachara. Opponents include the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]], the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]], [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] and [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]]. [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] and [[Pepper Potts]] also have guest appearances.\n\nAn eighth &#39;&#39;Power Pack&#39;&#39; miniseries, titled &#39;&#39;Power Pack: Day One&#39;&#39; debuted in March 2008. The series, which featured the same creative team as &#39;&#39;Fantastic Four &amp; Power Pack&#39;&#39; (Fred Van Lente and Gurihiru), focused on the origins of the team and the incorporation of their new member, Franklin Richards. This series is credited as being \&quot;based on\&quot; the origin tale from the 1984 series by Louise Simonson and June Brigman, though it is lighter in tone, has a shorter page-count, and changes some plot elements. The series also included scientific back-up information about the physical aspects of the siblings&#39; powers, with artwork by Colleen Coover.\n\nA ninth series, &#39;&#39;Skrulls vs Power Pack&#39;&#39;, made its debut in July 2008. The storyline involved Power Pack encountering the alien [[Skrull]]s. This miniseries also introduced the Kymellian Kofi Whitemane to this continuity. The creative team was Fred Van Lente as writer and Cory Hamscher as artist. Gurihiru provided the covers and the colors.\n\nA tenth miniseries, &#39;&#39;Wolverine and Power Pack&#39;&#39;, made its debut in November 2008. Wolverine had previously appeared in the &#39;&#39;X-Men and Power Pack&#39;&#39; miniseries. The series reunited the original creative team of Marc Sumerak and Gurihiru. Logan and the four children confronted [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], faced the [[Danger Room]], and defended the Xavier school against [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], giant robots programmed for anti-mutant genocide. Since the Power siblings are not actually mutants, their intervention was decisive in the outcome of the latter battle. Logan and Power Pack have adventures together in 19th-century New York City and 20th-century Tokyo.\n\nAn eleventh Power Pack miniseries began April 2010, with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] appearing and co-headlining, called &#39;&#39;Thor And The Warriors Four&#39;&#39;. The creative team is writer Alex Zalben and artwork once again by Gurihiru. Thor and the Power children confront an evil plot of [[Loki]]&#39;s while trying to save the Powers&#39; grandmother. High points include Alex wielding [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], [[Beta Ray Bill]] and the other [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]] turning into children, a guest appearance by [[Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers]], and Dr. Donald Blake making applesauce. The series also contains a back-up adventure of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] telling [[Hercules#In mythology|the story of his Twelve Labors]] while babysitting the Pack.\n\n===Mini Marvels===\nIn a [[Mini Marvels]] short, [[Spider-Man]] is hired to babysit the infant Power children.\n\n===House of M===\nAlex and Julie appear in &#39;&#39;[[House of M]]: Avengers&#39;&#39; #3 as members of a super-powered gang called the Wolfpack, the House of M&#39;s version of the [[New Warriors]].\n\n===Marvel 2099===\nIn the alternate &#39;&#39;[[Marvel 2099]]&#39;&#39; timeline, Julie, Jack, and Kate appear as adults, apparently having aged at a greatly reduced rate as a result of their powers. [[Alchemax]] CEO [[J. Jonah Jameson]] hires them to take down Captain America 2099 and [[Spider-Man 2099]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Man&#39;&#39; vol. 3, #14\u201315&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, it is revealed that they are actually [[Skrull]]s who have been brainwashed into believing they are Power Pack.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Man 2099&#39;&#39; vol. 3, #16&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nThe zombified Power children appear in &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]&#39;&#39; #3. They come into conflict with [[Nextwave]], who have not been infected at that point but are ruthlessly dispatched off-panel moments later. An explosion violently kills all of them but Alex, who appears in &#39;&#39;Marvel Zombies Halloween&#39;&#39; with other zombies attacking Kitty Pryde and her son Peter.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Zombies: Halloween&#39;&#39; #1 (one-shot)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===MC2===\nKatie, going by Kate, appears in issues 2\u20135 of &#39;&#39;[[A-Next]]&#39;&#39;. During a conversation with [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]], she indicates that something tragic happened to one of her brothers, but the details of the situation remain unclear.\n\n===Millennial Visions===\nIn the \&quot;Power Pack: Starting Over\&quot; story within Marvel&#39;s 2001 &#39;&#39;Millennial Visions&#39;&#39; one-shot comic, the team is depicted as a group of adults ranging from 25 (Katie) to 32 (Alex). In this alternate universe, the siblings split up after their parents were killed by anti-mutant activists and led disparate lives until Julie reunites them to face a new Snark attack.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Millennial Visions&#39;&#39; Marvel, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===New Mutants===\nKatie appears in a dystopian future ruled by [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;New Mutants&#39;&#39; #49&lt;/ref&gt; She has all of her siblings&#39; powers, explaining that this is because they were killed some time ago.
