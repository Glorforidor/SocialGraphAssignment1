The war opened a rift between dimensions, allowing the evil warlord [[Skeletor]] to travel to Eternia. Skeletor has set his sights on the ancient [[Castle Grayskull]], a fortress of mystery and power; whoever controls Grayskull will become Master of the Universe. To prevent Skeletor from achieving his goal, He-Man has received special powers and weapons from [[Sorceress of Castle Grayskull|the Sorceress]] and defends the castle from Skeletor. He-Man is supported by allies such as [[Man-At-Arms]] (the Eternian master of weapons) and [[Teela]], the adopted daughter of Man-At-Arms. Skeletor finds one half of the [[The Power Sword|Power Sword]], the key to Castle Grayskull. He-Man received the other half from the Sorceress, and must prevent Skeletor from linking the two halves and gaining access to the castle. To distinguish these stories from the minicomics which were released as tie-ins with the [[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe|TV series]], fans called this first version of Eternia \&quot;mini-Eternia\&quot; and the words were combined into Mineternia in 2003 by the minicomics fansite &#39;&#39;Eternia Minor&#39;&#39; (now &#39;&#39;He-Man Tales&#39;&#39;).&lt;ref name=\&quot;miniternia\&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dyerworks.com/he-man/WhatIsMineternia.htm|title=What is Mineternia?|authorlink=Mel Dyer|publisher=Dyerworks|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==={{anchor|DC Comics limited series (1982)}}DC Comics inserts and limited comics series (1982)===\nDebuting in DC Comics Presents issue #47 (dated July 1982), the series crossed over to the DC Universe in a story that was a team-up with Superman.

He returns, accompanied by the Evil Horde, to conquer the planet. Occasionally allying with Skeletor (but usually attempting to destroy him), Hordak is opposed by He-Man.\n\nIn the mini-comic &#39;&#39;King of the Snakemen&#39;&#39;, Skeletor discovers a pool of energy buried in Snake Mountain which contains ancient emperor [[King Hiss]]. Hiss discloses that he had conquered a number of planets before invading Eternia. Large portions of the planet had fallen to the Snake Men before they were defeated by the Council of the Elders and banished to another dimension. Hiss now seeks to recover his fellow [[Snake Men (Masters of the Universe)|Snake Men]] and bring vengeance to Eternia.\n\nDetails about Eternia&#39;s past are revealed in subsequent minicomics surrounding the Three Towers: Grayskull Tower, Viper Tower and Central Tower. The giant structure is raised from underground by Hiss and Skeletor and is the focus of adventures as He-Man tries to prevent all three villains from acquiring the towers&#39; secrets.\n\nHordak recognises the towers, and claims to have helped build Central Tower. The return of the Towers enhances the Sorceress&#39; magic, and she helps King Randor in his search to discover what happened to his long-lost brother [[Keldor]]. Skeletor is determined to stop the search.\n\n==={{anchor|Princess of Power mini-comics (1984-1986)}}Princess of Power minicomics (1984-1986)===\nIncluded with the She-Ra dolls beginning in 1985, these differed from the cartoon series.

Storylines included the battle for control of Viper Tower, a team-up of the three villainous factions and the destruction and rebuilding of Eternos. The &#39;Secret Files of Scrollos&#39; strip featured origin stories for many characters including Sy-Klone, Rio Blast and Modulok, and the series included the characters of Horde Prime and Scrollos. There was also a short-lived She-Ra comic title that lasted for 14 issues between 1986-87, with 3 specials including the &#39;Twins of Power&#39; special featuring both He-Man and She-Ra. The later issues of both the fortnightly MOTU comic and the Adventure Magazine reprinted stories from the German MOTU comics published by Ehapa, translated into English. In September 1989 the latter comic was renamed &#39;He-Man Adventure&#39; and was now based on the &#39;[[The New Adventures of He-Man|New Adventures]]&#39; toy line, again reprinting stories from the German Ehapa comics until the comic was discontinued in 1991.\n\n===Newspaper comic strip (1986-1991)===\nA newspaper comic strip, &#39;&#39;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&#39;&#39;, was produced from July 20, 1986 until 1991, written by James Shull and Chris Weber and distributed by McNaught Syndicate.&lt;ref name=Holtz&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holtz |first1=Allan |title=American Newspaper Comics: An Encyclopedic Reference Guide |date=2012 |publisher=The University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor |isbn=9780472117567 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most American newspapers dropped the strip mid-run, it was translated and distributed around the world.&lt;ref name=strips&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gelehrter |first1=Danielle |title=He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Newspaper Comic Strips |date=2017 |publisher=Dark Horse Comics |isbn=978-1506700731 |pages=6-7 |url=https://www.amazon.com/He-Man-Masters-Universe-Newspaper-Strips/dp/150670073X#reader_150670073X |accessdate=29 February 2020 |chapter=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nFifteen storylines were presented over the course of the run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MOTU Newspaper Comic Strips (1986-1991) |url=https://www.he-man.org/publishing/subsection.php?id=52&amp;subid=48 |website=He-Man.org |accessdate=29 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete run (minus a small number of \&quot;lost strips\&quot;) was published in 2017 by Dark Horse Comics as &#39;&#39;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Newspaper Comic Strips&#39;&#39;.&lt;ref name=strips/&gt;\n\n==={{anchor|He-Man minicomics (1989)}}He-Man minicomics (1989)===\nFour minicomics were included with the 1989 space-themed relaunch. The story was similar to the UK magazine version of &#39;&#39;He-Man&#39;s New Adventures&#39;&#39;, differing from the cartoon series.\n\n===2000s MVC and Image Comics series (2002-2005)===\nFrom 2002-2005 Image Comics and MVCreations published several series of comics and one-shots that mirrored tales of the 2002 Mike Young Productions show; the comic series elaborated and added to the mythos by introducing characters that never made it in after the 39 episodes of the television series. The first issues were seen in the summer of 2002 in the form of special promotional/preview issues, with three mini-series continuing on after; &#39;The Shards of Darkness&#39; in fall 2002, followed by &#39;Dark Reflections&#39; and &#39;Rise of the Snake Men&#39; in 2003. After delving into the back-stories of Skeletor&#39;s henchmen Beast-Man, Mer-Man, Trap-Jaw and Tri-Klops in a four issue &#39;Icons of Evil&#39; series, a short-lived ongoing series, solely produced by MVC, continued on for eight issues in 2004.

The minicomics were written by [[Tim Seeley]] and drawn by Wellinton Alves, with covers by [[Eric Powell (comics)|Eric Powell]]. According to Seeley, these minicomics would conclude the story originally planned to be the new direction of the 1980&#39;s action-figure line before it was cancelled. The story dealt with the Powers of Grayskull line, which included King Hiss and He-Ro, tying the toy continuity to the &#39;&#39;He-Man&#39;&#39; line and known as &#39;&#39;The New Adventures of He-Man&#39;&#39;. Seeley said that this comic line was intended to blend the He-Man continuities and select the best stories and ideas from MOTU history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=33608|title= CCI EXCLUSIVE: Seeley Scripts New Adventures of He-Man|accessdate=2011-08-05 |work= [[Comic Book Resources]]  |publisher= |date= 2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDC took over the Masters of the Universe Classics minicomics in 2012, with artwork by Wellinton Alves and Axel Gimenez. Five more minicomics were published to be included with the MOTU Classics line action-figures; the first told the origin story of Keldor (Skeletor), the second dealt with He-Man and Skeletor&#39;s final battle after their intergalactic [[The New Adventures of He-Man|New Adventures]]. The third begins ushering in the Son of He-Man era (introduced as a new series concept by [[Lou Scheimer]] in the 1990s, but never produced); which then continues for two more issues, culminating in the Third Ultimate Battleground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.he-man.org/publishing/subsection.php?id=52&amp;subid=133 |title= Masters Of The Universe Mini-Comics (Classics) |accessdate=2018-07-19 |publisher=He-Man.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===DC Comics (2012)===\n{{Update|section|date=February 2016}}\n{{main article|He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2012 DC comic)}}\nA Masters of the Universe comic book series was relaunched by DC Comics in June 2012, first appearing as a series of digital comics.

This introduced a new back-story for He-man&#39;s sister She-ra (as Despara), Skeletor (as the half-Garn son of King Miro), Hordak, and the Snakemen; moving the storyline further along, with a new Horde invasion of Eternia and He-Man taking the Eternian throne, amongst other new developments. [[He-Man/ThunderCats]], a crossover with another heroic 1980&#39;s action figure line, [[ThunderCats]], was also produced for 6 issues in 2016-2017. The current DC Masters of the Universe property is a 6-part crossover series with DC Comics&#39; [[Injustice: Gods Among Us (comics)|Injustice Storyline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seely|first=Tim |url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/injustice-vs-masters-of-the-universe-2018/injustice-vs-masters-of-the-universe-1 |title= INJUSTICE VS.
