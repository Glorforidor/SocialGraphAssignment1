The character was created by [[Dave Thorpe]] and [[Alan Davis]] for their ''[[Captain Britain]]'' stories.  She is the Omniversal Majestrix of [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]], and a servant of [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], charged with the safety of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Omniverse]]. \n\nHer first appearance was in ''[[The Mighty World Of Marvel|Marvel Superheroes]]'' #381 playing a major part in [[Alan Moore]] and [[Alan Davis]]' ''[[Jaspers' Warp]]'' storyline. She later had a recurring role in the pages of ''Excalibur''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nSaturnyne originally hails from Earth 9, one in a myriad of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative universes]]. She is a highly intelligent and ambitious woman and ends up on [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]] as the Omniversal Majestrix.  In this role she is part of the Dimensional Development Court, overseeing the [[Captain Britain Corps]] and charged with the safekeeping and maintenance of order and reality of the entire Omniverse. Saturnyne reports to Merlyn, the Omniversal Guardian. Saturnyne feels no moral or ethical conflict in sacrificing anybody, even an entire universe, if it means the preservation of the Omniverse.<ref group=s name=\"ohofmu2009\">{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] A-Z | volume=1 | issue=10 | title=Saturnyne | date=September 2009 | isbn=978-0-7851-3028-4 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nWhenever she decides to take a more personal interest in a matter, she calls upon the Avant Guard. The Avant Guard appear to be normal men, dressed in business suits and carrying an umbrella, but these umbrellas are in fact highly advanced weapons, capable of various abilities like interdimensional travel, destructive blasts and rays capable of [[devolution (fallacy)|devolving]] opponents. She is assisted by Dimples, an overweight man who loves Saturnyne deeply. Saturnyne herself cares little for Dimples and sees him only as a useful servant.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nSaturnyne first came into contact with Brian Braddock, also known as [[Captain Britain]], on the alternate Earth known as the Crooked World. This Earth is deemed to be a threat to the Omniverse and Saturnyne convinces Captain Britain to help evolve the backwards planet, hoping to eliminate its threat. They are opposed by the Status Crew, a group charged with maintaining the status quo. Saturnyne and Captain Britain manage to evolve the world, but are surprised when a bigger threat take its place: an alternate reality Mad Jim Jaspers uses his powers to create the [[Jaspers' Warp]], causing widespread insanity and the collapse of reality. Captain Britain and Saturnyne want to stop him, but are stopped by the [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Fury]], a killer machine. Saturnyne flees with her Avant Guard, leaving a heartbroken Dimples, Captain Britain and his sidekick [[Jackdaw (comics)|Jackdaw]] behind. All three are killed by the Fury, shortly thereafter.<ref>recounted in ''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\nThe Dimensional Development Court arrest Saturnyne and replace her with a man called Mandragon, who destroys the Earth 238 universe to prevent the Jaspers Warp from spreading. Merlyn resurrects Captain Britain (but not Jackdaw), and the Fury manages to escape under his own power. Captain Britain and the interdimensional mercenaries known as the [[Technet (comics)|Special Executive]] help Saturnyne escape from the Court to Earth-616. On Earth-616, Mad Jim Jaspers, an even more powerful version than the one on Earth 238, comes into power and threatens the world. The Fury also makes its way to Earth-616 and  battles Jaspers. During the conflict, Merlyn dies (though later he would reveal that he had just faked his death). In the end the Fury kills Jaspers and is killed shortly afterwards by Captain Britain and [[Captain UK]] from Earth 238, with help from Saturnyne and the [[Special Executive]]. Saturnyne manages to obtain cell samples of Jaspers and threatens to unleash a clone on Mandragon's world if he does not return her former position to her. Merlyn's daughter [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] succeeds her father, and Saturnyne becomes an agent of Roma.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nDespite having cooperated with Captain Britain at various times, she comes into conflict with Captain Britain when she sends the bounty-hunters known as the Technet after [[Rachel Summers|Phoenix]]. The Technet fail to capture her and Phoenix joins Captain Britain, [[Shadowcat]], [[Meggan]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] to form ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''.<ref>''Excalibur Special Edition'' #1</ref> Saturnyne later meets Phoenix in person, but does not capture her.<ref>''Excalibur'' #24</ref> Saturnyne rescinds her warrant against Phoenix but indefinitely extendeds the Technet's exile on Earth. She also delivers a message from Roma asking the other Captain Britains to free Excalibur's Captain Britain.<ref>''Excalibur'' #42, 44</ref> Later events reveal that Saturnyne was acting under Roma's orders when she originally sent the Technet against Phoenix, and that the Technet was meant to fail, resulting in the formation of Excalibur.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nSaturnyne remains Roma's servant and Omniversal Majestrix for the following years until the villain [[Mastermind (computer)|Mastermind]] destroys the Captain Britain Corps and imprisons Roma before being defeated by Captain Britain.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Saturnyne returns as Omniversal Majestrix, but has a bitter relationship with Brian, newly appointed ruler of Otherworld, whom she deems unworthy of his new position.{{issue|date=December 2012}} She is summoned by Roma when the annihilistic [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] Abraxas tries to destroy creation. While Roma is killed, Saturnyne shields Franklin and Valeria Richards from him.<ref>{{cite comic | title=[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]] | volume=3 | issue=48 | date=December 2001 | writer=[[Carlos Pacheco]] | cowriters=[[Rafael Marin]], [[Jeph Loeb]] | penciller=[[Jeff Johnson (artist)|Jeff Johnson]] | inker=Joe Weems | colorist=Liquid!

Saturnyne rebuffs him, but Roma sympathizes with him and gives him a talisman that allows him to travel through the web of life in order to save all the remaining spiders.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #7</ref>\n\nUltimately, Saturnyne is forced to confront the growing threat of the Incursions when the destruction of the various universes leads to the deaths of many members of the Captain Britain Corps. Saturnyne captures a Map Maker and attempts to use it to determine the cause of the Incursions. This instead brings forth an army of Map Maker robots which slaughter the Captain Britain Corps, Roma, and ultimately Saturnyne. Her last act is to place the secrets of the Starlight Citadel into the 616 Captain Britain's brain so that he can warn the Illuminati.<ref>New Avengers #28</ref>\n\nAs of the 2019 series ''Excalibur'' (v4), Saturnyne has been restored to life and is now referred to by some characters as the White Witch, and has gained a new enemy, the ancient [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse/En Sabah Nur]]. It is also stated that she has replaced Merlyn as the Omniversal Guardian, but remains referred to as the Omniveral Majestrix by her minions.<ref name=\"exv4_9\">{{cite comic | title=Excalibur | issue=9 | volume=4 | writer=Tini Howard | artist=[[Marcus To]] | date=2020 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\nAccording to Alan Davis, Dave Thorpe's original script had specified Saturnyne's appearance to be based on American actress [[Veronica Lake]].<ref group=s>{{cite web | title=Saturnyne | url=http://www.alandavis-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=187 | author=[[Alan Davis]] | date=December 25, 2006 | access-date=July 24, 2020 | website=Alan Davis Forum | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724123337/http://www.alandavis-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=187 | archive-date=July 24, 2020 | url-status=live}}</ref> Davis has explained that Saturnyne \"enjoys power, and she's a bit of an ice princess, which is why she's silver and blue, with a cold appearance\".<ref group=s>{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Marvel Age]] | volume=1 | issue=100 | title=Alan Davis on Excalibur | date=May 1991 | pages=21-23 | author=[[Peter Sanderson]] | issn=8750-4367 | publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> The ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' A-Z of 2008/09 describes Saturnyne as having a [[Machiavellianism (psychology)|Machiavellian mind]] and being a cunning strategist, and while not being outright brilliant (listed as a three on a scale of seven in intelligence), her indomitable strength of will and ambition has allowed her to ascend to her lofty position through hard work without being born into it.<ref group=s name=\"ohofmu2009\" />\n\n==Other versions==\nSaturnyne has counterparts on many worlds.
