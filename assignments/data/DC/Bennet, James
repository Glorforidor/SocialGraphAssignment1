Consequently, it is set in the [[DC Animated Universe]]. The show was created by Robert Goodman and [[Warner Bros. Animation]].&lt;ref name=Perlmutter&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=724\u2013725}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe story&#39;s main character, Infiltration Unit Zeta, is a humanoid robot (synthoid) designed to carry out covert assassinations on the behalf of the [[National Security Agency]]. When Zeta discovers that one of his targets is innocent, he experiences an [[existential crisis]] about goodness and the value of life; following this epiphany, Zeta finds that he can no longer kill. The newly enlightened Zeta refuses to continue on as an infiltration unit and abandons his mission, going rogue. Zeta is pursued by a team of [[NSA]] agents, led by the obsessed Agent Bennett, and is aided by a 15-year-old runaway, Rosalie \&quot;Ro\&quot; Rowan.\n\nThe series was cancelled after two seasons.\n\n==Plot==\n&#39;&#39;The Zeta Project&#39;&#39; follows the exploits of Zeta and Ro as they attempt to prove that he is genuinely non-violent, whereas the NSA agents pursuing him believe that the terrorists he was investigating before going rogue have reprogrammed him for some unknown purpose. To prove his innocence, Zeta and Ro search for his creator, the elusive Dr. Selig.\n\n==Characters==\n[[List of DC animated universe characters]]\n* Infiltration Unit Zeta ([[Diedrich Bader]]), nicknamed \&quot;Zee\&quot;, the titular character. As an infiltration unit designed to seek and destroy specific people, Zeta has the ability to holographically disguise himself as any individual that he has seen, as well as create custom appearances through mixing and matching various physical traits. Though Zeta no longer possesses the vast array of weapons that he originally came equipped with, his arms are equipped with saw blades and cutting lasers. He also possesses a wide array of other non-lethal tools, such as handheld welding lasers and a computer interface. In addition, Zeta possesses great mechanical strength, has extensible limbs, and is capable of self-repair.\n* Rosalie \&quot;Ro\&quot; Rowan ([[Julie Nathanson]]), a 15-year-old orphan who joined Zeta in his quest to prove his innocence. She usually acts as a wiser older sister to Zeta, who is often clueless about how to properly blend in with humans. She sees Zeta as family, and refuses to abandon him since she owes him her life. In one episode, it is revealed to Ro that she has a brother.\n* Special Agent James Bennet ([[Kurtwood Smith]]), the leader of the NSA team sent to capture Zeta. He vehemently believes that, regardless of Zeta&#39;s behavior, there is some sinister motive behind Zeta&#39;s sudden change in attitude and believes that he is working with the terrorist organization Brother&#39;s Day. Despite his supposed professionalism, he is seen to disobey orders himself, when it suits him, as well as abuse his authority. Although he overhears Dr. Selig&#39;s confession about giving Zeta a conscience, there is no sure sign that he will cease to be Zeta&#39;s enemy. \n* Agent West ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]), a young, arrogant and egotistical agent whose desire to prove himself only results in annoying his superiors, coworkers, and virtually anyone else he meets, to the point that Ro no longer even considers him to be a threat. He shares a last name and is similar in appearance to [[Wally West]], the only Flash in the DCAU. Both characters are also voiced by Michael Rosenbaum.\n* Agent Lee ([[Lauren Tom]]), a compassionate female agent who comes to see Zeta in a more redeeming light, as he continues to go out of his way to help people. She later quits the team; later episodes imply that she was subsequently promoted, and is now able to occasionally help Zeta escape from the people that she worked for.\n* Agent Rush ([[Erika Alexander]] -Season 1, [[Dominique Jennings]] -Season 2), a by-the-book agent who replaces Lee after she quits the team.\n* Bucky Buenaventura ([[Ulises Cuadra]] -Season 1, Blayn Barbosa -Season 2), a child genius who occasionally aids Zeta and Ro.\n* Dr. Selig, ([[George Segal]] -Season 1, [[Hal Linden]] -Season 2), Zeta&#39;s hard-to-find creator.\n* Infiltration Unit 7, (Diedrich Bader -uncredited) - a later infiltration unit model who Zeta comes into conflict with after foiling one of his missions. Infiltration Unit 7 possesses all of Zeta&#39;s abilities, greater strength and durability, and a much larger arsenal. It is much less subtle in the execution of its duties than Zeta, and hence, from Zeta&#39;s viewpoint, it is evil.\n\n==Episodes==\n=== Season 1 (2001) ===\n{{Episode table |background=#FC7309 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=20 |director=16 |writer=16 |airdate=13 |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = The Accomplice\n| DirectedBy      = Curt Geda\n| WrittenBy       = Robert Goodman\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|1|27}}\n| ShortSummary    = Zeta is on the run from the [[NSA]].

Ro persuades Zeta, whom she dubs \&quot;Zee\&quot;, to search for his creators, since they would be able to tell the NSA that Zeta was innocent. Zeta convinces Ro to distract the clumsy Agent West while he breaks into the NSA van in order to download information on his creators.

Zeta brings Ro to the hospital, where he is told that she will be all right, but he still feels guilty and begins to question if whether or not Ro should continue to remain by his side.

When Ro meets her &#39;brother,&#39; she realizes that although he looks like her, he looks nothing like the picture she has. Zeta exposes the show to be a fake, and the producer, who did not know what was going on, vows to change it.

The motorcycle takes control of itself, and Ro and Zeta are brought to a shelter. However, Zeta cannot detect a tornado and they are brought to a house in the suburbs. The house belongs to Bucky Buenventura, who had taken over the motorcycle. Bucky wants Zeta&#39;s help in finding his parents, who were kidnapped by Dr. Tannor. Zeta agrees, and they go with Bucky to the clinic where Dr. Tannor now works. Bucky&#39;s parents are working on a machine designed to rejuvenate patients, but it has malfunctioned, turning Bucky&#39;s parents and several patients into very small children. Dr. Tannor knocks Zeta out, and tells Bucky that if he fixes the machine, he will give Zeta and the Buenventuras back. Bucky grudgingly begins to fix the machine, but he cannot make it work. Dr. Tannor tries to destroy Zeta, but Zeta escapes and finds Ro and Bucky. The machine malfunctions and threatens to destroy the compound. Zeta, Ro, Bucky, and the children all escape, and Zeta tells Bucky that he downloaded the machine&#39;s schematics, and will be able to return Bucky&#39;s parents to normal.\n| LineColor = FC7309 \n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2 (2002)===\n{{Episode table |background=#2A54A9 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=20 |director=16 |writer=16 |airdate=13 |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 13\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = Absolute Zero\n| DirectedBy      = Curt Geda\n| WrittenBy       = Robert Goodman &amp; Kevin Hopps\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|3|23}}\n| ShortSummary    = Zeta finds out that Dr. Selig is meeting at Cryobin, a [[cryogenics]] lab, with a scientist called Dr. Wilhelm. Zeta pretends to be Dr. Wilhelm by imitating his retinal patterns, but the real Dr. Wilhelm shows up. Dr. Selig&#39;s guards shoot at Zeta, but they miss and destroy the computer in the cryogenics room. The room is evacuated, and no one notices that Dr. Selig has been trapped in a cryogenic freeze unit. Zeta realizes that since the [[computer]] has malfunctioned, Dr. Selig will die unless Zeta helps him. Zeta controls the freeze unit to keep Dr. Selig&#39;s temperature secure until help can arrive. But Agent Bennett, realizing Zeta is in Cryobin, decides to defy the orders that Cryobin is above his clearance, and go after Zeta. Zeta is monitoring the temperature, but an explosion makes him pull away out of concern for Ro. Ro is all right, but the explosion further damaged the cryogenic unit. Zeta has to take Dr. Selig out, and use his internal heating to keep the doctor&#39;s condition stable. He saves Dr. Selig, but does not get a chance to talk to him. Bennett is stopped by his superiors, and Agent Lee reveals that she tipped them off. Lee believes Zeta is innocent, so she resigns from Bennett&#39;s team.

They all seem to be fans of Zeta, and Buss has an obsessive crush on Ro. Meg and Plug convince Zeta to allow them to take him apart and see how he works, and in exchange they will help him find Dr. Selig. Ro is reluctantly taken to Buss&#39;s house. Bucky manages to message Ro, warning her that Meg and Plug want to use Zeta for parts. Ro escapes to save Zeta, and Zeta manages to repair himself while Ro drives one of the hackers&#39; motorcycles.

Ro tries to find him in order to save him. She tracks him to a government warehouse, where she calls Bucky. He refuses to help out of fear that he is being tracked, so she breaks in herself. Inside, Bennett and the other agents discover a module in Zeta&#39;s head that was not on his schematics. They erase Zeta&#39;s memories as he struggles to hold on to what memories he can. Then, they attempt to alter the module. Zeta sees them as hostile targets and breaks free, beginning to destroy the warehouse. Bennett asks Ro to reveal Zeta&#39;s position, but she refuses, defending him over the intercom. Zeta hears her speak and is able to access his saved memories. Zeta and Ro escape. Zeta expresses concern over the module in his head and the fact that he has no idea what it does, but it caused him to behave violently.

He puts a computer chip from these parts in his computer. The computer is taken over by Infiltration Unit 7, which begins to order parts to repair itself. Zeta is scanning for a shoulder part that he needs on the net when he discovers orders being placed to rebuild IU7. Deciding that Jace Foley must be in danger, he and Ro go to stop IU7. IU7 is still determined to damage Zeta, but must also acquire all of the parts necessary to rebuild itself. When Zeta comes, the two synthoids fight and IU7 seemingly manages to kill Zeta. He goes to recover a final part he needs, taking Jace hostage. Zeta repairs himself, and he and Ro go to the warehouse where Jace was taken. Zeta removes IU7&#39;s CPU chip, and the synthoid is shut down. NSA agents come to clean up, led by Agent Lee.

Zeta is deemed vagrant, and is tracked by security guards. Boyle says that he will remove the chip if Zeta and Ro steal parts for his new project. They both agree. Zeta steals several parts, but after several close calls, he and Ro come up with a plan to stop him. They allow several NSA agents to see Ro seemingly giving parts to Dr. Boyle, and Zeta in a hologram accepting them and confessing everything. Zeta and Ro get Boyle to remove the chip, and then the agents chase after Boyle.

He later finds out that Dolan is innocent and does not realize that he is helping to maneuver funds for the terrorist organization Brother&#39;s Day. This is the terrorist organization that Zeta is suspected to be working for. Later, Dolan discovers that Zeta is impersonating him, but Zeta decides not to terminate him.

He tells Sweete that he does not want to continue, so Tidus pulls a gun on him. Zeta saves him while Tidus escapes, but discovers that \&quot;Selig\&quot; is actually Dr. Marcus Edmund, the man who built Zeta&#39;s holographic emitters. Dr. Edmund was forced into helping Brother&#39;s Day destroy the government&#39;s highest level synthoid lab, the Gnosis, where Zeta was created and Selig works. With the aid of his personal holo-emitter, Ro and Zeta pose as one of Sweete&#39;s lackeys and Edmund, respectively.
