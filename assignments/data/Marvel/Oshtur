Doctor Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against [[Magic in fiction|magical]] and mystical threats. Inspired by stories of black magic and &#39;&#39;[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]&#39;&#39;, Strange was created during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] to bring a different kind of character and themes of [[mysticism]] to Marvel Comics.\n\nThe character begins as an egotistical surgeon who loses the ability to operate after a car crash severely damages his hands. Searching the globe for healing, he encounters the [[Ancient One]], the Sorcerer Supreme. Strange becomes his student, and learns to be a master of both the mystical and the [[martial arts]]. He acquires an assortment of mystical objects, including the powerful [[Eye of Agamotto]] and [[Cloak of Levitation]], and takes up residence in a mansion referred to as the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], located in 177A Bleecker Street, [[New York City]]. Strange assumes the title of Sorcerer Supreme and, with his friend and valet [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], defends the world from mystical threats.\n\nThe character was first portrayed in live-action by [[Peter Hooten]] in the 1978 television film &#39;&#39;[[Dr. Strange (1978 film)|Dr. Strange]]&#39;&#39;. [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films &#39;&#39;[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]&#39;&#39; (2016), &#39;&#39;[[Thor: Ragnarok]]&#39;&#39; (2017), &#39;&#39;[[Avengers: Infinity War]]&#39;&#39; (2018), and &#39;&#39;[[Avengers: Endgame]]&#39;&#39; (2019). Cumberbatch will reprise his role in the sequel &#39;&#39;[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]&#39;&#39; (2022).\n\n==Publication history==\n&lt;!-- in-universe plot information needs moving into the Fictional character biography section --&gt;\n\n===Creation===\nArtist [[Steve Ditko]] and writer [[Stan Lee]] have described the character as having been originally the idea of Ditko, who wrote in 2008, \&quot;On my own, I brought in to Lee a five-page, penciled story with a page/panel script of my idea of a new, different kind of character for variety in Marvel Comics.

Doctor Strange appeared in issues #110\u2013111 and #114 before the character&#39;s eight-page [[origin story]] in #115 (December 1963).

Inspired by the [[pulp-fiction]] magicians of Stan Lee&#39;s childhood as well as by contemporary [[Beat Generation|Beat]] culture, &#39;&#39;Dr. Strange&#39;&#39; remarkably predicted the youth counterculture&#39;s fascination with Eastern mysticism and [[psychedelia]].

Stan Lee, seeing the issue after publication, ordered Englehart and Brunner to print a retraction saying this was not God but &#39;&#39;a&#39;&#39; god, to avoid offending religious readers.

The series ended with a cliffhanger as his home, the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], was heavily damaged during a battle. Among the losses was Doctor Strange&#39;s entire collection of mystic books and other important artifacts. As a consequence, Strange was now considerably weaker and several spells designed to protect humanity from [[vampire]]s and the evil serpent god [[Set (Marvel Comics)|Set]] expired.\n\nThe title was discontinued so that the character&#39;s adventures could be transferred to another split book format series. &#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; vol. 2, #1-19 (April 1987 \u2013 Oct. 1988) was shared with street heroes [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]. This new Doctor Strange series resolved Strange&#39;s quest to reclaim his power and missing artifacts, as well as resurrecting the Defenders, who had died in the last issue of that team&#39;s title.\n\n====1990s====\nStrange was returned to his own series, this time titled &#39;&#39;Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme&#39;&#39;, which ran 90 issues (November 1988 \u2013 June 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id= 3645|title= Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial creative team was writer [[Peter B.

Too vain to accept a teaching job, Strange desperately searches for a way to restore the motor function in his hands.\n\nAfter exhausting his funds, Strange becomes a drifter. Depressed and still searching, Strange happens to overhear two sailors discussing a [[hermit]] called the [[Ancient One]] (who is actually the Earth&#39;s Sorcerer Supreme) in the [[Himalayas]], who can cure any ailment. Strange, nearly broke, seeks out the aged mystic. The Ancient One refuses to help Strange due to his arrogance, but senses a good side that he attempts to bring to the surface.

Its counterpart, the &#39;&#39;[[Darkhold]]&#39;&#39;, contains all the knowledge of [[black magic]] in the Marvel Universe, and is likewise indestructible. It is possible to destroy single pages of either book, but the balancing spell in the other book is destroyed as well to maintain a mystical balance. A collective of the three powerful magical beings - Agamotto, Oshtur and Hoggoth, known as the Vishanti - must allow the spell to be destroyed.\n\nEven though the book is a tome of benevolent magic, the spells within can still be dangerous when used improperly. This is proven when a young, inexperienced Strange tried to use the &#39;&#39;Book of the Vishanti&#39;&#39; to resurrect his dead brother Victor, but the spell, known as the Vampiric Verses, caused Victor to become the [[vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] [[Baron Blood (comics)#Baron Blood II|Baron Blood]] years later.\n\nApart from spells and mystical knowledge, the book also contains information about persons and events. It is unknown how the book is able to contain up to date and recent information even though it was written thousands of years ago.\n\nThe first known owner of the book was the [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantean]] sorcerer [[Varnae]] from around 18,500 BC. The next known owner was the Babylonian god [[Marduk Kurios]]. Marduk set a [[griffin]] to guard the Book. The sorcerer known as the [[Ancient One]] traveled back in time to c. 4000 BC and defeated the griffin and returned to the 20th century. The Ancient One would remain the book&#39;s owner, despite a brief loss when the dark wizard [[Kaluu]] returned the Book to the Griffin, until he deemed his student, Doctor Strange, worthy of taking it.\n\nDoctor Strange keeps the book in his town house library in [[New York City]]&#39;s [[Greenwich Village]]. He briefly lost the book when he destroyed his home to prevent the alien wizard [[Urthona (comics)|Urthona]] from taking his magical artifacts, but the book was saved by Agamotto, who transported it to his realm and returned it to Strange some time later.\n\n====Cloak of Levitation====\n{{anchor|Cloak of Levitation}}\nThe Cloak of Levitation is depicted as a potent mystical [[cloak]] worn by Doctor Strange. The item has been referred to as a \&quot;relic\&quot; in the live-action movie &#39;&#39;[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]&#39;&#39; (2016).  The primary purpose of the cloak is to give its wearer the ability to [[levitation|levitate]] and fly.\n\n=====Appearance=====\nThere were two distinctly different cloaks worn by Doctor Strange bequeathed to him by his mentor, the [[Ancient One]]: a billowing, full-length blue cloak, that had minor abilities and spells woven into it, and the later, red cloak that Strange is usually seen wearing.  The first appearance of the first (blue) [[cloak]] was in &#39;&#39;[[Strange Tales]]&#39;&#39; #114 (November 1963). The first appearance of the second (red) cloak was in &#39;&#39;[[Strange Tales]]&#39;&#39; #127 (December 1964).&lt;ref name=\&quot;Cloak of Levitation\&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/universe/Cloak_of_Levitation| title=Cloak of Levitation| publisher=Marvel Universe| accessdate=2014-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cloak of Levitation is seen in a great many battles where it often plays a very significant role. While it is extremely durable, there are a few occasions when it is damaged. Its repair requires that Strange engage an ally, Enitharmon the Weaver.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Doctor Strange&#39;&#39; Vol. 2, #77 (June 10, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/20161/doctor_strange_1974_77 | title=Doctor Strange (1974) #77 | publisher=Marvel | accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====Eye of Agamotto====\n{{main|Eye of Agamotto}}\n\n====Orb of Agamotto====\n{{In-universe|section|date=July 2016}}\nAside from the Eye of Agamotto, the Orb of Agamotto is the other occult object that Doctor Strange owns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A416CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT178&amp;dq=Orb+of+Agamotto+doctor+strange#v=onepage&amp;q=Orb%20of%20Agamotto%20doctor%20strange&amp;f=false|title=Doctor Strange: Don&#39;t Pay the Ferryman|last1=Stern|first1=Roger|last2=Gillis|first2=Peter B.|date=2015-10-07|publisher=Marvel Entertainment|isbn=9781302482473|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a powerful [[scrying]] crystal ball powered by the Agamotto entity to detect the use of magic anywhere in the world, providing Strange with a location and visual.

It usually is inside a display case with three curved legs. When summoned, the glass covering rises and the ball levitates. While powerful, the Orb has been blocked by exceptionally powerful mystic forces (such as [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]]) who do not want their exact location known. On at least one occasion, it has been used to open a dimensional portal to the realm of Agamotto. In the film &#39;&#39;[[Thor (film)|Thor]]&#39;&#39;, the Orb is briefly shown in Odin&#39;s Trophy Room in Asgard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Hedash, Kara|url=https://screenrant.com/odin-vault-thor-movie-marvel-objects-retcons/|title=Every Marvel Object In Odin&#39;s Vault (And How They Were Retconned)|date=June 28, 2019|website=[[Screen Rant]]|language=en-US|access-date=July 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Enemies==\n{{expand section|date=March 2020}}\nThe following are the enemies of Doctor Strange:\n\n* [[Baron Mordo]] - An evil wizard and former student of the Ancient One.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Strange Tales&#39;&#39; #111.

Making his sole appearance in the [[Iron Man]] story \&quot;The Stronghold of Dr. Strange\&quot; in &#39;&#39;[[Tales of Suspense]]&#39;&#39; #41 (1963), the character gained mental powers in a freak [[lightning]] strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/drstrng2.htm |title=Doctor Strange |first=Jeff |last=Christiansen |date=May 11, 2002 |publisher=The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304072554/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/drstrng2.htm |archivedate=March 4, 2013 |url-status=live |accessdate=March 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe character has starred in several [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] titles. In the miniseries &#39;&#39;[[Marvel 1602]]&#39;&#39; #1-#8 (Nov. 2003 \u2013 June 2004), Sir Stephen Strange is both the court [[physician]] and [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. The title &#39;&#39;[[Spider-Man 2099]]&#39;&#39; introduced a female version of Strange who shares her body with a [[demon]] in issue #33 (1995).
