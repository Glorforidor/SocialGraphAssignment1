Cover art by [[Gill Fox]].]]\n&#39;&#39;Crack Comics&#39;&#39; started off as a monthly anthology of 68 pages, often with as many as 15 features. At first edited by [[Ed Cronin]], much of its material was originally \&quot;packaged\&quot; by the [[Eisner and Iger Studio]].&lt;ref name=\&quot;Steranko\&quot; /&gt; \&quot;[[Clock (comics)|The Clock]],\&quot; as well as such newspaper strip reprints as \&quot;[[Rube Goldberg]]&#39;s Side Show,\&quot; \&quot;[[Jane Arden (comics)|Jane Arden]],\&quot; and \&quot;[[Ned Brant]],\&quot; moved over from Quality&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Feature Comics]]&#39;&#39;.\n\nThe first use of the publisher name \&quot;Quality Comic Group\&quot; was on the cover of &#39;&#39;Crack Comics&#39;&#39; #5 (Sept. 1940).&lt;ref name=chs&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212535/http://www.chs.org/comics/quality.htm|archivedate=September 27, 2007|title=Quality Comic Group: A Brief History|publisher=[[Connecticut Historical Society]]|url=http://www.chs.org/comics/quality.htm|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWith issue #26 (Nov. 1942), at the height of [[World War II]], the title dropped down to a bi-monthly schedule due to wartime paper shortages; and with issue #33 (Spring 1944) it became quarterly, also reducing its page-count to 60. It was around this time that publisher Arnold dropped Eisner &amp; Iger as a \&quot;packager\&quot; and began producing much of the material in-house.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Steranko\&quot; /&gt; The syndicated newspaper strip reprints \&quot;[[Jane Arden (comics)|Jane Arden]]\&quot; and \&quot;Ned Brant\&quot; disappeared during this period, as well as such recurring features as \&quot;[[Black Condor]],\&quot; \&quot;[[Don Q (comics)|Don Q]],\&quot; and \&quot;[[Snappy (comics)|Snappy]].\&quot;\n\nCartoonist [[George Brenner]] became editor of &#39;&#39;Crack Comics&#39;&#39; with issue #31 (Oct. 1943) (Cronin having left the post in Feb. 1942), a few issues before Brenner&#39;s character [[Clock (comics)|The Clock]] stopped appearing in the book&#39;s pages.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Clock\&quot;&gt;Markstein, Don.

Accessed Nov. 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with issue #42 (May 1946) the title went back to a bimonthly schedule, which it maintained until its cancellation with issue #62. (During this time, the title also gradually reduced its page-count from 60 to 52 to 36.) Brenner stayed on as editor almost to the end, leaving the post after issue #61 (July 1949).\n\n=== &#39;&#39;Crack Western&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Jonesy&#39;&#39; ===\nAs comics readers&#39; tastes changed in the years following World War II, Quality publisher Arnold responded. Starting with issue #63 (Nov. 1949), &#39;&#39;Crack&#39;&#39; became a [[Western comic]], changing its name to &#39;&#39;Crack Western&#39;&#39;. This format lasted 22 issues until #84 (May 1953), when the title changed again, to &#39;&#39;Jonesy&#39;&#39;. &#39;&#39;Jonesy&#39;&#39; published one issue with the old numbering system and then restarted (from #2), publishing until issue #8 (Oct. 1954), when it was cancelled for good.\n\n=== Next Issue Project ===\nFollowing the demise of &#39;&#39;Crack Comics&#39;&#39; and later the publisher itself, many of Quality Comics&#39; characters lapsed into the [[public domain]]. In November [[2011 in comics|2011]], as part of editor [[Erik Larsen]]&#39;s \&quot;[[Next Issue Project]],\&quot; [[Image Comics]] published &#39;&#39;Crack Comics&#39;&#39; \&quot;#63,\&quot; containing the following stories:\n* [[Captain Triumph]], written and penciled by [[Alan Weiss (comics)|Alan Weiss]]\n* The Space Legion, written and illustrated by [[Chris Burnham]]\n* [[Clock (comics)|The Clock]], written and illustrated by [[Paul Maybury]] \n* Molly the Model, written and illustrated by [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]]\n* [[Alias the Spider]], written and illustrated by Adam McGovern and Paolo Leandri\n* Spitfire, written and illustrated by [[Herb Trimpe]]\n* Slap Happy Pappy, written and illustrated by [[Joe Keatinge]]\n* Hack O&#39;Hara (with a cameo by the Space Legion), written and illustrated by [[Erik Larsen]]\n* [[Red Torpedo]], written and illustrated by [[B.

He was a regular feature in the title \u2014 usually as the final story in each issue \u2014 until his last appearance, in issue #35 (Autumn 1944). The Clock&#39;s spot was taken over by &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Floogy the Fiji]]&#39;&#39;&#39;, a [[Jungle girl (stock character)|jungle comics]] feature which lasted from issue #36 (Winter 1944) until issue #59 (Mar. 1949).\n* &#39;&#39;&#39;[[Black Condor]]&#39;&#39;&#39;: A mystery man with the power of flight, the character&#39;s adventures were originally written by [[Will Eisner]] and drawn by [[Lou Fine]].&lt;ref&gt;Markstein, Don.
