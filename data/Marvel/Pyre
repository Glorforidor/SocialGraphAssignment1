The first incarnation of the character was the one created by the third and current human host to the symbiote (the first two being [[Spider-Man]] and [[Kree|Tel-Kar]]), [[Eddie Brock]], and\u2014since 2011\u2014its fifth host, [[Flash Thompson]]. Beginning with &#39;&#39;[[Venom: Lethal Protector]]&#39;&#39;, eighteen [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] following Brock&#39;s adventures were published monthly between February 1993 and January 1998. A monthly &#39;&#39;Venom&#39;&#39; series began publication in 2003, following a new character, Patricia Robertson, and a clone of the original symbiote. The series concluded in 2004 after 18 issues. In 2011 another monthly series, following the adventures of Flash Thompson, was launched. The series concluded in October 2013 with its forty-second issue.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Publication history==\nThe first &#39;&#39;Venom&#39;&#39; title, &#39;&#39;[[Venom: Lethal Protector]]&#39;&#39;, was published in January 1993 and written by Venom co-creator [[David Michelinie]]. The story began the character&#39;s transition from unambiguous villain to anti-hero and introduced the symbiote offspring ([[Scream (comics)|Scream]], [[Phage (comics)|Phage]], [[Riot (comics)|Riot]], [[Lasher (comics)|Lasher]] and [[Agony (comics)|Agony]]),&lt;ref name=\&quot;LP1\&quot;/&gt; who would recur in Marvel comics until the 2011 &#39;&#39;[[Carnage, U.S.A.]]&#39;&#39; limited series. Seventeen other series were printed between August 1993 and January 1998, including 1994&#39;s &#39;&#39;[[Venom: Separation Anxiety]]&#39;&#39; (which continued the story of Venom&#39;s offspring and spawned the 1995 \&quot;[[Planet of the Symbiotes]]\&quot; cross-series story arc), 1996&#39;s &#39;&#39;Along Came a Spider&#39;&#39; (which introduced symbiote anti-hero [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]]) and 1997&#39;s &#39;&#39;Venom: On Trial&#39;&#39; (which saw Eddie Brock tried for his crimes as Venom). [[Larry Hama]] wrote the most individual series (eight in total), including the 1997 final installment (&#39;&#39;Venom: The Finale&#39;&#39;, which saw the symbiote apparently killed).&lt;ref name=\&quot;MiscStories1\&quot;/&gt; According to editor [[Tom Brevoort]], the series was cancelled because \&quot;The return on the book had declined to the point where any immediate financial reward was overshadowed by [then editor-in-chief [[Bob Harras]]{{&#39;}}s] discomfort with the character starring in his own title.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Shutt | first= Craig | date = August 1997 | title = Villain Turned Hero: Venom | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited-series run consisted of 60 issues.&lt;ref name=\&quot;MiscStories1\&quot;/&gt;\n\nA new &#39;&#39;Venom&#39;&#39; series began in June 2003, written by [[Daniel Way]]. This series followed a new character, Patricia Robertson, and a clone of the Venom symbiote. Eighteen issues were produced by Way through November 2004, comprising the story arcs \&quot;Shiver\&quot; (#1-5), \&quot;Run\&quot; (#6-10), \&quot;Patterns\&quot; (#11-13), and \&quot;Twist\&quot; (#14-18).\n\nIn 2011, an ongoing &#39;&#39;Venom&#39;&#39; series began under writer [[Rick Remender]] with Spider-Man supporting character [[Flash Thompson]] in a leading role. The character regained the use of his legs while using the symbiote following their loss during his service in the [[Iraq War]] (as shown in &#39;&#39;[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #574). The first issue introduced new versions of the villains [[Crime Master#Bennett Brant|Crime Master]] and [[Jack O&#39;Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Crime Master.27s Jack O.27Lantern|Jack O&#39;Lantern]], who became recurring antagonists for Thompson. Issue #18 featured the return of Brock, who killed Hybrid and Scream in his crusade against the symbiotes and eventually bonded to the Toxin symbiote. The series was born after Thompson was first unveiled as the new Venom by writer [[Dan Slott]] in &#39;&#39;[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]&#39;&#39; #654. Remender was unsure how to develop the  Thompson narrative until he realized that he was a tragic hero: a violent man, haunted by a drinking problem and physical abuse suffered at the hands of his father.&lt;ref name=\&quot;RemenderLeaves\&quot;/&gt;\n\nSlott suggested that the new Crime Master&#39;s secret identity would be Bennett Brant, the thought-dead brother of Thompson&#39;s then-girlfriend Betty. Remender and his co-writer Cullen Bunn developed the new character, with Bunn developing the idea of multiple Crime Masters existing throughout history. Thompson found an arch-rival in the new Jack O&#39;Lantern, developed by Remender and artist Tony Moore. Remender decided that making him a parallel of Thompson would create a stronger nemesis; therefore, Jack was also given a traumatic childhood in which he was exploited by Crime Master. &#39;&#39;Venom&#39;&#39; #13 saw the first mini-event of the series: a crossover with the [[Red Hulk]], [[X-23]] and the new  [[Ghost Rider]]. The event was initially conceived as a reunion of [[List of Fantastic Four members#New Fantastic Four|New Fantastic Four]] members [[Hulk]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], Ghost Rider and Spider-Man as part of a &#39;&#39;Venom&#39;&#39;-&#39;&#39;Wolverine&#39;&#39; crossover. As the idea developed with writer [[Jason Aaron]], it was decided to incorporate those characters&#39; legacy characters into the Red Hulk, X-23, the new female Ghost Rider and Thompson&#39;s Venom. Following the event, Thompson joined another Remender-written book (&#39;&#39;[[Secret Avengers]]&#39;&#39;).&lt;ref name=\&quot;RemenderLeaves\&quot;/&gt;\n\nRemender stopped writing &#39;&#39;Venom&#39;&#39; in August 2012 (after issue #22) to work on &#39;&#39;[[Captain America]]&#39;&#39; and the launch of &#39;&#39;[[Uncanny Avengers]]&#39;&#39;. He was replaced by Cullen Bunn, who had periodically worked as co-writer during Remender&#39;s term. The Venom character remained a member of the Secret Avengers, a series still written by Remender.&lt;ref name=\&quot;RemenderLeaves\&quot;/&gt; In September 2012, Bunn said that Thompson would be moved from New York to Philadelphia from &#39;&#39;Venom&#39;&#39; #28. This relocation would allow the introduction of a new love interest, the superhero [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)#Valkyrie .28Brunnhilde.29|Valkyrie]]. Editor Tom Brennan explained, \&quot;His superhero career almost cost him everything...this is a good man with a troubled past who needed a fresh start...to take his next steps in becoming the hero he was born to be.\&quot;&lt;ref name=\&quot;2012SepBunn\&quot;/&gt; Marvel editor Stephen Wacker said the location change reflected Marvel&#39;s desire to expand the Marvel universe beyond New York City.&lt;ref name=\&quot;2012OctWacker\&quot;/&gt; Bunn&#39;s run introduced the new character Mania, one of Thompson&#39;s students who is empowered by part of the Venom symbiote. In August 2013, Marvel announced that &#39;&#39;Venom&#39;&#39; would end with issue #42 in October 2013. Bunn was informed of the decision while writing &#39;&#39;Venom&#39;&#39; #31-#38, which he stated gave him time to bring some plot threads to a conclusion, but having originally outlined thirty issues worth of stories, there would be some ideas left to be told.&lt;ref name=\&quot;Venom2011End\&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;Venom2011End2\&quot;/&gt;\n\n=={{anchor|Limited Series (1993-1998)}}Limited series (1993\u20131998)==\n\n===&#39;&#39;Venom: Lethal Protector&#39;&#39; (1993)===\n[[File:MarkBagley2.jpg|thumb|alt=Man with black shirt and glasses, sitting at a table at a comic-book convention|[[Mark Bagley]] provided art for the first three issues of &#39;&#39;Venom&#39;&#39;{{&#39;}}s inaugural title.]]\n{{Main|Venom: Lethal Protector}}\n* Writer: [[David Michelinie]]\n*[[Penciler]]: [[Mark Bagley]] (#1\u20133), [[Ron Lim]] (#4\u20136)\n*[[Inker]]: [[Al Milgrom]] (#1\u20134), Sam de la Rosa (#1\u20136) \nThe initial six-part series was published between February and July 1993.
