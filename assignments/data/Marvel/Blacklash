Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Whiplash, together with fellow supervillains the [[Melter]] and [[Man-Bull]], are recruited by other-dimensional villain the [[Black Lama]] to form the team the [[Death Squad (comics)|Death Squad]] and fight Iron Man.

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nScarlotti is re-employed by an unnamed consortium, financed by Hammer, to kill Stark employee Vic Martinelli, and is provided with an upgraded costume and weaponry and the new alias Blacklash. Despite the upgrades, however, Scarlotti is defeated by Iron Man and humiliated by being dragged before his employers.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man&#39;&#39; #146\u2013147 (May\u2013June 1981).

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nScarlotti decides to renounce his criminal identity and marries and has a child. A lack of money forces Scarlotti to assume his identity again, and he becomes the target of an assassin, who kills his wife when she returns to their apartment. As Blacklash, Scarlotti then finds and kills the assassin, and vows to abandon the identity of Blacklash forever.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Elektra&#39;&#39; #5\u20137 (March\u2013May 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Scarlotti, however, is hired by a rival of Stark and returns as Whiplash, with an upgraded costume and new weaponry. Whiplash manages to battle Iron Man to a standstill in their first encounter, but is killed several weeks later by Iron Man&#39;s new sentient armor, which crushes Scarlotti&#39;s throat against Tony Stark&#39;s wishes.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man&#39;&#39; #8 vol. 2, (Sept. 1998) &amp; 26 &amp; 28 (March &amp; May 2000).

She was a mutant with unrevealed abilities and used [[adamantium]] wires connected to her gloves as whips. She was part of Critical Mass&#39;s mutant [[Band of Baddies]]. The Baddies kidnapped a mutant girl and her father in order to coerce them to join their band. They forced the daughter to knock out [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], but they quickly recovered. The daughter then unleashed her powers, blew up the warehouse they were in, and defeated all of the Baddies. Whiplash disappeared after the daughter&#39;s telekinetic explosion enabled her to get free.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Comics Presents&#39;&#39; #49\u201350. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nShe later joined the [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]], and was hired by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to lure Spider-Man into a trap by threatening a United Nations ambassador.

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The Femme Fatales later received an invitation to join [[Superia]] and her organization of female criminals, the [[Femizons]]. They accepted, and were among the superhuman females aboard Superia&#39;s cruise ship, where they battled [[Captain America]] and the [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. Whiplash also traveled to Superia&#39;s private island to be one of her new Femizons.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Captain America&#39;&#39; #389\u2013390. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter the group disbanded, Whiplash teamed up with [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Shockwave (comics)|Shockwave]] and [[Killer Shrike]] in a plot to take over a retired aircraft carrier, the USS Intrepid. She and her allies were defeated by [[Heroes for Hire]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Heroes for Hire&#39;&#39; #4.

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nDuring the \&quot;[[Hunt for Wolverine]]\&quot; storyline, Whiplash took the name of &#39;&#39;&#39;Snake Whip&#39;&#39;&#39; and is with the Femme Fatales when they assist [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] in attacking [[Kitty Pryde]]&#39;s group at the King&#39;s Impresario Restaurant in [[Madripoor]]. She engaged [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] in battle before [[Kitty Pryde]] gets her and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] away from the restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor&#39;&#39; #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Following that victory, Snake Whip stayed by Viper&#39;s side as she ordered Knockout and Mindblast to have a defeated Rogue and Storm be delivered to their clients and when Viper speaks to a representative from Soteira. As Snake Whip asks if they are going to ignore [[Sapphire Styx]]&#39;s vampiric appetite, Viper says that they have to obey the representative&#39;s orders and \&quot;let the @#$%&amp; feed.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor&#39;&#39; #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After another call from Soteira&#39;s representative, Viper and Snake Whip check up on Sapphire and find her acting strange claiming that Wolverine&#39;s Patch alias is here. Snake Whip works to restrain her only to get knocked out. Upon recovering, Snake Whip starts to see Patch attacking Sapphire even though Viper doesn&#39;t see it.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor&#39;&#39; #3.

When the Femme Fatales were arrested, Kitty Pryde got the info about Soteira being after Wolverine from Snake Whip who gave the information to her in exchange for a light sentence.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor&#39;&#39; #4.

Both are past associates of the Swordsman ([[Fenris (comics)|Andreas von Strucker]]) and frequenters of BDSM events before becoming supervillains. The duo are forcibly recruited into the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thunderbolts&#39;&#39; #104 (Sept. 2006). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Construct ===\nThis version of Whiplash is not a person, but a personality construct created by the aptly named &#39;&#39;&#39;Badgal&#39;&#39;&#39;. The construct is feminine and thus tends to possess females. Initially, Badgal used this construct to possess a random citizen, but later used it to possess [[Honey Lemon]] and later [[GoGo Tomago]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Big Hero 6&#39;&#39; #3\u20134.

One day, the village is attacked by someone wearing a stolen suit of [[Iron Man&#39;s armor|Iron Man armor]], who murders a number of townspeople, including his father &#39;&#39;&#39;Igor Vanko&#39;&#39;&#39; ({{lang-ru|\u0418\u0301\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c \u0412\u0430\u0301\u043d\u043a\u043e}}) in an attempt to frame [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]].\n\nUsing a specialized rifle, Vanko is able to shoot the impostor just before he flees, causing the chest plate on the armor to come off. Vanko becomes obsessed with exacting vengeance on Stark, still believing him to be the man who attacked his village, and decides to use the chest plate to fashion a suitable weapon to do so. Over the next six months, he reverse engineers a suit of body armor equipped with energy whips, and vows to kill Stark in order to avenge his father.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man vs Whiplash&#39;&#39; #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nAfter breaking into the prison where Stark is being held for his alleged crimes, Vanko kills several guards and attempts to track down and murder Stark and his confidant [[Pepper Potts]]. Stark fights off Vanko using a crude suit of Iron Man armor fashioned from parts of various machines around the prison, and forces him to flee. After Stark tracks down the criminal syndicate who framed him, Vanko arrives at their headquarters, intent on finishing off Iron Man once and for all. It is there that Vanko learns that Stark was indeed framed and that the syndicate was hired to destroy Volstok by secret international consortium funded by several governments including USA and Russia, notably Russian Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]], in order to wipe out an activist who was creating anti-Putin sentiments. Despite learning of Iron Man&#39;s innocence, Vanko makes one final attempt to kill him, claiming that even though he did not destroy the village, his technology did. After the building catches fire, both men are ultimately forced to run to safety, and Vanko then makes his escape. Following this, Stark is cleared of his alleged crimes, and helps rebuild Volstok. As this is happening, Vanko is seen in Moscow approaching Saint Basil&#39;s Cathedral in the [[Red Square]] preparing to properly exact vengeance this time around.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Iron Man vs. Whiplash&#39;&#39; #2\u20134.
