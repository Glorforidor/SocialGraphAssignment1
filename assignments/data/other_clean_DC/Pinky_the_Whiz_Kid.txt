==== Fictional character biography ====
Mr. Scarlet is district attorney Brian Butler, who along with his adopted son Pinky the Whiz Kid, fought evil in his city for several years.  His success was such that his employment was frequently in jeopardy due to a lack of crime. As a result, throughout his series he took up several odd jobs to supplement his family's income. He used inventive devices to help him apprehend criminals, and had great acrobatic and hand-to-hand combatant skills.In his first appearance in Wow Comics #1, Brian was based in Gotham City.  This may be the first use of the name of this city in comics. Later retcons established Mr. Scarlet's base in either New York City or Fawcett City.The heroes tangle with a wide variety of villains, including the sinister Death Battalion, who plan the assassinations of top government officials. The Battalion's members include Dr. Death, the Ghost, the Horned Hood, the Black Thorn, the Black Clown and the Laughing Skull, and their leader, known as "the Brain", is actually the warden of El Catraz prison.Although initially appearing in the 1940s, Mr. Scarlet and Pinky were revealed to still be active and at relatively the same age level in the 1970s during a team-up with the Justice League of America and Justice Society of America in Justice League of America 135-137. It was during this team-up that the two crime-fighters joined with several other heroes to form Shazam's Squadron of Justice.

==== As Pinky the Whiz Kid ====
Pinky was the adopted son of district attorney Brian Butler, also known as Mr. Scarlet, who fought evil in his city for several years.  His father's success was such that his employment was frequently in jeopardy due to a lack of crime.  As a result, he throughout his series took up several odd jobs to supplement his family's income.
Although initially appearing in the 1940s, Mr. Scarlet and Pinky were revealed to still be active and at relatively the same age level in the 1970s during a team-up with the Justice League of America and Justice Society of America. It was during this teamup that the two crimefighters joined with several other heroes to form Shazam's Squadron of Justice, as King Kull had captured Shazam and the Elders that gave the Marvel Family their powers, and was trying to wipe out humanity on all three Earths. Scarlet and Pinky helped defeat the Weeper and Earth-2 Joker while they committed crimes on Earth-S and turned people into diamonds, although no further adventures of this team were chronicled thereafter.


==== As Mr. Scarlet ====
After the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Pinky Butler is revealed to have taken over the identity of his father Mr. Scarlet after his death, having been active in Fawcett City for several years. It is also revealed how they retained their youth since the 1940s, as the wizard Shazam provided a protective field around the city for decades allowing its inhabitants to age slower than their contemporaries in other cities.
Pinky first appeared as Mr. Scarlet in Power of Shazam #44.
Mr. Scarlet later rescues Freddy Freeman from Prometheus' captivity,  alongside the Bulleteer.


== Other versions ==
A new version of Mr. Scarlet appeared in Elseworlds' Kingdom Come and The Kingdom miniseries. Mr. Scarlet is drawn as a bright red devil of a man known for hanging out at Titans Tower bar with Matrix, the new Joker's daughter, and the new Thunder. He has a large crest running down his hood, based on the fin on the original's cowl.
