Pencils were by [[Todd McFarlane]], [[Bart Sears]], and Giffen himself; inks were by Joe Rubinstein, [[P. Craig Russell]], Tom Christopher, [[Dick Giordano]] and [[Al Gordon (comics)|Al Gordon]]. All three covers were pencilled by [[Bart Sears]], including issue #1, contrary to DC&#39;s credits listing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n==The Alien Alliance==\n\nThe alien coalition consisted of several disparate races; several had only appeared before with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] one thousand years in the future. Assembling this alliance was a major diplomatic victory for the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]], considering the animosities many of the members shared for one another (particularly the three races of the Vega system). As it worked out, the Dominators provided the overall strategy for the invasion, with input from each member world while the Khunds acted as the shock troops for the first wave of attack that overran Australia. Each member world was then tasked with invading or subverting a particular sphere of influence:\n\n{|class=\&quot;wikitable\&quot;\n|-\n| [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]]:\n| the driving force behind the Alliance and the invasion of Earth, and consequently the Alliance&#39;s &#39;&#39;de facto&#39;&#39; leaders\n|-\n| [[Khund]]s:\n|a brutish race of humanoid warriors\n|-\n| [[Thanagarian]]s:\n| [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]]&#39;s people, now living under a fascist police state\n|-\n| Gil&#39;Dishpan:\n| an aquatic race of conquerors that live within hovering, armed and armored [[cybernetic]] shells\n|-\n| Durlans:\n| a race of shapeshifters (see [[Chameleon Boy]])\n|-\n| Warlords of Okaara:\n| a race of warmasters from the [[Vega in fiction#Comics|Vegan]] star system\n|-\n| Citadelians:\n| the twisted clone-race that comprised the armies of the Vega system empire known as &#39;&#39;The Citadel&#39;&#39;\n|-\n| [[Daxam]]ites:\n| the seemingly mild-mannered humanoids who acquire [[Kryptonians|Kryptonian]]-type abilities under a [[stellar classification|yellow sun]], but are vulnerable when exposed to [[lead]]\n|-\n| [[Psion (comics)|Psions]]:\n| yet another species from the Vega system, a reptilian race of amoral scientists, the result of ancient experiments in [[genetic engineering]] by the beings who would one day become the [[Guardians of the Universe]]\n|}\n\n* The Warlords of Okaara launched a major attack on European [[Russia]].  They battled [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and the combined Soviet metahuman forces, led by the [[Rocket Red|Rocket Red Brigade]].\n* The Durlans infiltrated [[Cuba]], kidnapping and then replacing [[Fidel Castro]] and leading members of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Cuban government]] and [[Military of Cuba|army]].  They were unmasked by [[Wally West|the Flash]] and [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]].\n* The Gil&#39;Dishpan established a major underwater base of operations within the [[Arctic Ocean]], fighting the [[Doom Patrol]], the [[Sea Devils (comics)|Sea Devils]], and military forces from [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]].\n* The Khund spread out over many islands in [[Oceania]], fighting both the [[United States Marine Corps]] and a number of heroes, including [[Power Girl]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], [[Firehawk (comics)|Firehawk]], and the fifth [[Starman (Will Payton)|Starman]].\n* The Psions conducted secret experiments on humans in [[Gotham City]].\n* The Alliance also launched a raid on [[Wonder Woman]]&#39;s home of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]].\n\nAdditionally, some members of the Alliance were tasked with specific areas of responsibility and played little part in the military operations side. The Citadelians were given charge of administering the Alliance&#39;s vast &#39;&#39;Gulag&#39;&#39; of potential opponents and experimental subjects; the Psions were charged with (or left alone to) conducting biological research on humans; and the Daxamites were largely an observer group, providing medical and scientific assistance to the Alliance.\n\n==Plot==\nThe emotionless, calculating Dominators have put together an Alliance to invade Earth and eliminate the threat posed by their unpredictable \&quot;metahumans\&quot;. After purging the galaxy of numerous potential threats to their plan - securing [[Darkseid]]&#39;s non-interference by assuring him that they would not destroy the planet and thwart his quest for the [[Anti-Life Equation]], assassinating many former members of the disbanded [[Green Lantern Corps]], and attacking the [[Omega Men]] - the Alliance launches a massive attack on Earth, overrunning [[Australia]] and establishing a base there from which to conquer the rest of the planet. Meanwhile, the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] appeals to the [[Lords of Order]] to allow Earth&#39;s magicians to join in Earth&#39;s defense, only to be told that he must instead ensure their neutrality for fear of provoking the Lords of Chaos from intervening on behalf of the invaders and escalating the conflict into a cataclysm that would mean the destruction of everyone involved. The Alliance tenders an offer to spare the human race provided that the world&#39;s governments surrender their metahumans, but the [[United Nations General Assembly]] overwhelmingly rejects this offer.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Invasion!&#39;&#39; #1 (January, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[Superman]] leads a counterattack against the main Alliance base. The counterattack is temporarily disrupted by the Daxamite observers, who become the equal of Superman and temporarily defeat him, but fall prey to Earth&#39;s atmospheric differences from their own world and how it affected their extreme and lethal sensitivity to lead poisoning.  After Superman helps save them, they decide to withdraw from the Alliance and help defend Earth. To that end, a small fleet of troop transports arrive and demand that the Alliance withdraw from Earth. The Dominators decide to ignore them, unaware of the effect a yellow sun has on Daxamites, until the fleet deploys several thousand soldiers into space as a near invincible attack force. This, combined with key defeats in various theaters, and a full-scale and uncontrollable riot aboard the Alliance Gulag, leads to a quick collapse for the Alliance and individual surrenders by each former member.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Invasion!&#39;&#39; #2 (February, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHowever, a young Dominator, aspiring to prominence among his people, manages to isolate the \&quot;metagene\&quot; in humans that enables a person to develop superhuman powers. On his own initiative, he develops and deploys the Gene Bomb, a device that bathes the Earth in an energy that affects every metahuman exposed to it, causing them to lose control of their powers and fall into a coma. Since the point of the invasion was to harness these beings, not eradicate them, the Dominator is imprisoned by his own government. A group of heroes unaffected by the Gene Bomb, led by the [[Martian Manhunter]], manage to take information from the Dominator&#39;s mind crucial to reversing the effects of the Gene Bomb and restore the affected metahumans back to health.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Invasion!&#39;&#39; #3 (March, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Impact==\n\n&#39;&#39;Invasion!&#39;&#39; was DC&#39;s line-wide crossover event for 1988. It crossed over into 30 other DC comics and also featured guest appearances from other DC Universe staples such as [[Adam Strange]], the planet Thanagar, and one-time [[Justice League of America]] sidekick [[Snapper Carr]] and his team the [[Blasters (comics)|Blasters]]. The Blasters would make several more appearances, fighting further alien threats to Earth.\n\nThe invasion of Earth and the Gene Bomb had some long-lasting effects on the DC Universe. In particular, the recently relaunched &#39;&#39;Doom Patrol&#39;&#39;, a combination of the &#39;60s, &#39;70s, and brand new members, lost two team members and fell apart. This was done to give new writer [[Grant Morrison]] a clean slate to revamp the book.  He started with &#39;&#39;Crawling From the Wreckage&#39;&#39; storyline starting in &#39;&#39;Doom Patrol&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #19. Morrison used the Invasion fallout for a pair of [[Animal Man]] stories, including the acclaimed \&quot;The Death of the Red Mask\&quot;. Also, the Gulag storyline introduced the character of [[Vril Dox|Vril Dox II]] and the organization called [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]], which received its own title soon after &#39;&#39;Invasion!&#39;&#39; ended.\n\nThe Gene Bomb was also responsible for giving powers of mind control to [[Maxwell Lord]], but such powers were mostly unused. Another character from the [[Justice League International]] whose power was improved was [[Fire (comics)|Fire]]. Initially, she could only exhale bursts of fire, but after being affected by the Bomb she got powers similar to [[Marvel Comics]]&#39;s [[Human Torch]].\n\nOne of the Dominators ended up under the control of the Queen Bee, ruler of the fictional country of Bialya. Though he did not long survive her anger, the technology he introduced was used against the Justice League multiple times.  Several other Dominators were left on Earth for years and appeared in various comics (usually briefly) including one in Captain Atom (became a farmer), a few in the &#39;&#39;Outsiders&#39;&#39; #44, and a cameo in a prison break in &#39;&#39;Flash&#39;&#39;. Also, a Dominator appeared in &#39;&#39;Joker: Last Laugh&#39;&#39; #3. A Khund was also killed by Mongul during a prison break in &#39;&#39;Green Lantern&#39;&#39;.\n\nThe greatest impact of &#39;&#39;Invasion&#39;&#39; was its introduction of the metagene as the explanation within the DC Universe as to how some people gain superhuman abilities. The Flash&#39;s father, Rudolph West (a Manhunter agent) appears to die in an explosion in [[Cuba]], defending the land during &#39;&#39;Invasion&#39;&#39; #2. His subsequent returns would plague the Flash and his mother multiple times. Unusual for the time, the three issues were published as perfect-bound comics, each the length of three usual comics - a throwback to the \&quot;80-page giants\&quot; of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]].\n\n[[File:Power of the Atom 07.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Cover to &#39;&#39;Power of the Atom&#39;&#39; #7 by [[Graham Nolan]], which was an &#39;&#39;Invasion!&#39;&#39; crossover]]\n\n===Tie-in issues===\n&#39;&#39;In the reading order presented in the back of each main issue:\n\n&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Invasion!&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; #1:\n* Daily Planet #1\n*&#39;&#39;[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate!]]&#39;&#39; #11\n*&#39;&#39;[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm the Nuclear Man]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #80\n*&#39;&#39;[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #21\n*&#39;&#39;[[Justice League International]]&#39;&#39; #22\n*&#39;&#39;[[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]&#39;&#39; #8\n*&#39;&#39;[[Wonder Woman]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #25\n*&#39;&#39;[[Superman (vol. 2)|Superman]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #26\n*&#39;&#39;[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]&#39;&#39; #449\n*&#39;&#39;[[Animal Man]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) #6\n*&#39;&#39;[[Doom Patrol]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #17\n*&#39;&#39;[[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Power of the Atom]]&#39;&#39; #7\n*&#39;&#39;[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]&#39;&#39; #5\n*&#39;&#39;[[Swamp Thing]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #80-81\n*&#39;&#39;[[Captain Atom]]&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #24\n*&#39;&#39;[[Detective Comics]]&#39;&#39; #595\n*&#39;&#39;The [[New Guardians]]&#39;&#39; #6\n*&#39;&#39;The Spectre&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #23\n&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Invasion!&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; #2:\n*&#39;&#39;Checkmate! #12\n*&#39;&#39;Firestorm the Nuclear Man&#39;&#39; #81\n*&#39;&#39;Flash&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #22\n*&#39;&#39;Justice League International&#39;&#39; #23\n*&#39;&#39;Manhunter&#39;&#39; #9\n*&#39;&#39;Wonder Woman&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #26\n*&#39;&#39;Superman&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #27\n*&#39;&#39;Adventures of Superman&#39;&#39; #450\n*&#39;&#39;Power of the Atom&#39;&#39; #8\n*&#39;&#39;Starman&#39;&#39; #6\n*&#39;&#39;Animal Man&#39;&#39; #7\n\nOthers (omitted from the #2 list):\n*&#39;&#39;[[Suicide Squad]]&#39;&#39; #23\n*&#39;&#39;Captain Atom&#39;&#39; #25\n*&#39;&#39;The New Guardians&#39;&#39; #7\n*&#39;&#39;Doom Patrol&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #18\n&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Invasion!&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; #3:\n*&#39;&#39;[[Justice League Europe]]&#39;&#39; #1\n*&#39;&#39;[[Blasters (comics)|Blasters]]&#39;&#39; Special #1\n*&#39;&#39;[[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] &#39;89&#39;&#39; #1\n*&#39;&#39;The Spectre&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #24\n* Invasion!
