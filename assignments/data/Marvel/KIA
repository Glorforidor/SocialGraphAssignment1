The next three clones, named Michael, Van and Patrick, originally worked as the [[Scarlet Spider]]s, as part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative#Shadow Initiative|Black Ops group within The Initiative]]. They were revealed to be clones in &#39;&#39;Avengers: The Initiative&#39;&#39; #7. He was cloned once more, in the &#39;&#39;Killed in Action&#39;&#39; story arc when some of the vacant positions in the Initiative teams were filled with MVP clones.\n\nThe original&#39;s only appearance outside the pages of &#39;&#39;Avengers: The Initiative&#39;&#39; was a brief cameo in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] &#39;&#39;[[What If (comics)|What If]]&#39;&#39; comic. All that is known about the original character has been revealed in that series, with Van Patrick&#39;s (and the first sets of clones) origins being shown in the 2007 &#39;&#39;Avengers: The Initiative Annual&#39;&#39;.

Given Michael Van Patrick&#39;s descent from the creator of the super soldier serum, many people came to suspect his athletic abilities to be superpower-related. A subsequent scandal cost Michael his [[scholarship]]. [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]], an Initiative superhero, recruited Michael for the Initiative program.&lt;ref name=\&quot;AvengInit#1\&quot;&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] | Penciller = [[Stefano Caselli]] | Inker = [[Daniele Rudoni]] | Story = Happy Accidents | Title = [[Avengers: The Initiative]] | Issue = 1 | Date = June 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n[[File:Mvpdies.jpg|thumb|180px|left|MVP is killed after saving [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]] in &#39;&#39;Avengers: The Initiative&#39;&#39; #1.

The first clone is sent to his family&#39;s [[Organic farming|organic]] [[vegetable]] farm in [[Liberty, Kentucky]], with a false story that he had failed the Initiative program because of his lack of powers. The clone, who is coming to realize that his memories are not his own and that he will never be the real Michael Van Patrick, elects to stay with \&quot;his\&quot; family. He is warned however to never tell them that he is not their real son.\n\nHowever, the clone&#39;s first appearance was a couple of months prior in a few panels of &#39;&#39;Avengers: The Initiative&#39;&#39; #4, where Justice and Cloud 9, not knowing that clones had replaced Michael, flew to the Van Patrick farm to inform MVP&#39;s parents of his death.

The Tactigon interfaces with this clone&#39;s mind activating latent memories of the real MVP&#39;s death. Hacking into the Initiative&#39;s computer, the clone learns of his \&quot;death\&quot; and gains a list of all those present at the time. The disturbed clone demolishes the cloning lab, attacking [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] while repeating \&quot;Killed in Action\&quot; over and over again and carving the initials \&quot;KIA\&quot; into his chest. The clone continues its rampage through Camp Hammond, striking those whose names are on his list and attacking anyone else who gets in the way.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nAt the end of the third part, the clone attempts to find the [[coma]]tose [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]], the [[drill instructor]] who had sent MVP to the ill-fated combat training session.

After arriving at the location, KIA is met by the collective Initiative force of [[The Mighty Avengers|The Avengers]], the remaining Scarlet Spiders, a rogue [[New Warriors#Initiative Team|New Warriors]] group and the trainees. In the battle&#39;s climax, the first clone uses the device to download KIA&#39;s memories leaving his body brain-dead. After the battle, it is revealed that the Avengers have stored both the body and the Tactigon away in an undisclosed location, before which [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]] secretly took the device with KIA&#39;s memories from the battlefield for himself, which reads \&quot;&#39;&#39;ready to transmit brain patterns to new host body&#39;&#39;\&quot; leaving KIA&#39;s eventual fate open-ended.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nMany trainees and staff members were injured during KIA&#39;s rampage, but only [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Tako Shamara|Dragon Lord]],&lt;ref name=\&quot;AvengInit#12\&quot;&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Slott]] &amp; [[Christos N.

In the Scarlet Spider&#39;s first appearance, &#39;&#39;Avengers: The Initiative&#39;&#39; #3, the suit features several devices, including four mechanical spider-arms or \&quot;[[Remote manipulator|waldoes]]\&quot; on each suit, one more than on the original, along with [[stealth technology|cloaking]] devices and a short-range [[GPS]] microwave communication system. In &#39;&#39;Avengers: The Initiative&#39;&#39; #7, the suits display mechanical web-shooters while retaining the ability to change appearance to other versions of the Spider-Man costume or street clothes. In &#39;&#39;[[New Warriors#New Warriors (vol. 4)|New Warriors]]&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #15 (October 2008), it was revealed the suits have had their StarkTech removed, which prevented the suits being affected when all StarkTech was made inoperable by Skrull invaders.
