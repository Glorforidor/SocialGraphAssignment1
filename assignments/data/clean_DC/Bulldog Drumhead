                <span class="s2">&quot;extract&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;All-American Publications was one of two American comic book companies that merged to form the modern day DC Comics, one of the two largest publishers of comic books in the United States. Superheroes created for All-American include the original Atom, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, and Wonder Woman, all in the 1940s&#39; Golden Age of Comic Books.\n\n\n== Publishing history ==\nMax Gaines, future founder of EC Comics, formed All-American Publications in 1938 after successfully seeking funding from Harry Donenfeld, CEO of both National Allied Publications (publisher of Action Comics and other titles) and sister company Detective Comics (publisher of that namesake comic book). As Gerard Jones writes of Donenfeld&#39;s investment:\n\nHarry had agreed on one condition: that [Gaines] take [Detective Comics partner] Jack Liebowitz on as his partner. ... Jack would be tempted to leave and form a competing company if there was nothing to hold him. And it may well have been a way for Harry to keep Gaines under control; since Jack was still drawing a salary and significant bonuses from Detective Comics and [self-distributorship] Independent News, he wouldn&#39;t let Gaines take off on his own or act against the interests of the other companies. ... Gaines became the principal and Jack Liebowitz the minority owner of All-American [Publications].\nWhile All-American, at 225 Lafayette Street in Manhattan, was physically separated from DC&#39;s office space uptown at 480 Lexington Avenue, it used the informal \&quot;DC\&quot; logo on most of its covers for distribution and marketing reasons. In 1944, Gaines sold his share of the company to Liebowitz, keeping only Picture Stories from the Bible as the foundation of his own new company, EC. As Jones describes,\n\nGaines saw the end of the superhero fad coming and wanted to get into something more durable, like children&#39;s books and magazines. ... In 1944, he decided he&#39;d had enough. He let Jack Liebowitz buy him out with a loan from Harry.... Liebowitz promptly orchestra the merger of All American Comics and Detective Comics into National Comics, of which he was the junior partner, vice president, and publisher. Next he took charge of organizing National Comics, Independent News, and their affiliated firms into a single corporate entity, National Periodical Publications\&quot;. \nBefore the merger, Gaines first rebranded All-American with its own logo, beginning with books cover-dated February 1945: All-Flash #17, Sensation Comics #38, Flash Comics #62, Green Lantern #14, Funny Stuff #3, and Mutt &amp; Jeff  #16, and the following month&#39;s All-American Comics #64 and the hyphenless All Star Comics #24. Liebowitz later merged his and Donenfeld&#39;s companies into National Comics Publications.\n\n\n== Creative legacy ==\n\nDuring All-American&#39;s existence, much cross-promotion took place between the two editorially independent companies, so much so that the first appearance of the Justice Society of America, in All Star Comics #3 (Winter 1940/41), included in its roster All-American characters the Atom, the Flash, Green Lantern and Hawkman, and the National characters Doctor Fate, Hour-Man (as it was then spelled), the Spectre, and the Sandman \u2014 creating comics&#39; first intercompany crossover, with characters from different companies interacting \u2014 although National&#39;s Sandman, Spectre and Hour-Man had previously appeared in solo adventures in All Star Comics #1 (Summer 1940).\nWith Gaines as editor, assisted by Sheldon Mayer, All-American Publications launched its flagship series All-American Comics with an April 1939 premiere. Like many comics of the time, All-American debuted with a mix of newspaper comic strips, reprinted in color, and a smattering of original, comic-strip-like features. Among the strips were three hits of the era: Mutt and Jeff, by Al Smith ghosting for strip creator Bud Fisher; Skippy, by Percy Crosby; and Toonerville Folks by Fontaine Fox. New content included Scribbly, a semiautobiographical Mayer feature about a boy cartoonist. All-American Comics lasted 102 issues through October 1948.\nAlso debuting that month was Movie Comics (\&quot;A full movie show for 10 cents\&quot;), featuring simple adaptations of movies using painted movie stills, as well as cartoonist Ed Wheelan&#39;s popular Minute Movies comics.  The first of its six issues through Aug. 1939 adapted no fewer than five films: Son of Frankenstein, Gunga Din, The Great Man Votes, Fisherman&#39;s Wharf, and Scouts to the Rescue.\nThe next two comics were Mutt &amp; Jeff, which ran 103 issues from Summer 1939 - June 1958; and the company&#39;s superhero debut, Flash Comics #1 (Jan. 1940), which introduced the super-speedster title character, created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, as well as the Golden Age Hawkman and future Hawkgirl, by Fox and artist Dennis Neville, and Johnny Thunder, by scripter John Wentworth and artist Stan Aschmeier, among other features.\nThe Golden Age Green Lantern, from Batman writer Bill Finger and artist Martin Nodell, debuted in All-American Comics #16 (July 1940), followed by the original Atom, created by Bill O&#39;Connor and penciler Ben Flinton, in All-American #19 (Nov. 1940). Wonder Woman was introduced in a nine-page story in All Star Comics #8 (Jan. 1942), the product of psychologist William Moulton Marston (under the pseudonym Charles Moulton) and Max Charles Gaines, and drawn by artist Harry G. Peter.\n\n\n== All-American characters ==\n\n\n=== Superhero/masked crimefighter ===\nThe Atom\nDoctor Mid-Nite\nThe Flash\nThe Gay Ghost\nGreen Lantern\nHawkman and Hawkgirl\nHop Harrigan\nThe King\nLittle Boy Blue and the Blue Boys\nMr. Terrific\nSargon the Sorcerer\nJohnny Thunder\nGary Concord, the Ultra-Man\nThe Whip\nWildcat\nWonder Woman\n\n\n=== Adventurer/war ===\nThe Black Pirate\nGunner Godbee\nRed, White and Blue (Red Dugan, Whitey Smith, Blooey Blue)\n\n\n=== Funny-animal/other humor ===\nBulldog Drumhead\nThe Red Tornado\nScribbly the Boy Cartoonist\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDC Comics, and The Justice Society of America at Don Markstein&#39;s Toonopedia\nDC Comics Timeline, SupermanArtists.comics.org&quot;</span>
