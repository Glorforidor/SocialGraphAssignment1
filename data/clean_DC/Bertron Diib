                <span class="s2">&quot;extract&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;L.E.G.I.O.N. is a science fiction comic book created by Keith Giffen, Bill Mantlo and Todd McFarlane and published by DC Comics. The principal subject of the comic book is a team of fictional extraterrestrial superheroes. The characters first appeared in Invasion! #1 (December 1988). The original series chronicled the formation and activity of an interplanetary police force whose mission was to act as a peace-keeping force in their galaxy. \n\n\n== Publication history ==\n\n\n=== Invasion! ===\nThe characters who went on to form L.E.G.I.O.N. were first introduced in the three-part miniseries Invasion!\nVril Dox, Garryn Bek, Strata, Lyrissa Mallor, and the Durlan appeared as prisoners of the Alien Alliance who helped stage a breakout from the Starlag, a prison spacecraft overseen by the alien race known as the Citadel.\n\n\n=== L.E.G.I.O.N. ===\nL.E.G.I.O.N. &#39;89 debuted in 1989 (as indicated by the title) and reached issue #70 (as L.E.G.I.O.N. &#39;94 in 1994).  L.E.G.I.O.N. stands for Licensed Extra-Governmental Interstellar Operatives Network.This series followed the adventures of Vril Dox and his allies after their escape from the Starlag in Invasion!.  Dox takes his companions to Colu, where they overthrow the Computer Tyrants running the planet.  They encounter the bounty hunter Lobo, who had been tracking Bek to exact revenge on him for having accidentally killed one of Lobo&#39;s treasured space dolphins.  Dox smoothly and swiftly turns Lobo into a valued ally.  With this group, Dox decides to form an interplanetary police force.  He bases his operation on the planet Cairn after a difficult and bloody coup against Cairn&#39;s ruler, Bek&#39;s father-in-law, whom Dox shoots point blank.  The series follows the rise, heyday, and fall of this police force.\n\n\n=== R.E.B.E.L.S. ===\n\nAs a consequence of the Zero Hour event, the original title was replaced by R.E.B.E.L.S. &#39;94 (Revolutionary Elite Brigade to Eradicate L.E.G.I.O.N. Supremacy) (beginning with issue #0), continuing the same storyline with basically the same characters.  R.E.B.E.L.S. &#39;96 #17 was the last issue.\nWhen L.E.G.I.O.N. is usurped by Vril Dox&#39;s son Lyrl, Dox and those members who remain loyal to him (Lobo, Phase, Strata, Stealth, and Borb) are forced to flee in a mysterious new ship in order to regroup and regain control of L.E.G.I.O.N.  Telepath comes along unwillingly.  Garv, Strata&#39;s husband, unbalanced by not understanding recent events, becomes involved in a desire to get Strata back.  Borb (who is in love with Stealth) sacrifices his life in order to protect his friends from an other-dimensional army of brain-stealing entities; the very ones that had created the ship they had been fleeing in.  They soon name the ship the &#39;Di&#39;ib&#39;, after an old L.E.G.I.O.N. hero.\nThe team has to fight old friends, such as Zena Moonstruk, Gigantus and Davroth.  Behind the scenes help comes from old ally Marij&#39;n and Captain Comet.  The group also encounters the demonic entity Neron, who plays a critical role in the resolution of the main storyline providing the means to defeating Lyrl in exchange for the soul of a future generation of the Dox line.\nThe heroes regain control in the last issue, with Vril using the knowledge given to him by Neron to find a way to lobotomize his son, stripping him of his super-intelligence. Dox and Stealth retire to take care of Lyrl, whose brain has been reduced to that of a normal one-year-old, while Captain Comet is placed in charge of L.E.G.I.O.N.\n\n\n=== Post-series appearances ===\nIn the 2004 Adam Strange (issues #5-8) and the later Rann/Thanagar War series (issues #1\u20136 and the Infinite Crisis special), Vril Dox has resumed control of L.E.G.I.O.N. and is using droids as officers. Adam Strange is pursued by the group in the pages of his own series, framed for the seeming destruction of Rann. Former L.E.G.I.O.N. members have been referred to in the subsequent Infinite Crisis series, and many make a cameo appearance in one panel of Infinite Crisis #1, although the lineup appears to be out of date (in addition to Darius&#39; appearance on one of the screens, Bertron Diib is visible between several of the dialogue balloons).  L.E.G.I.O.N. and Vril Dox are mentioned several times, although not shown, in Mystery in Space (2006) featuring  Captain Comet.  Dox plays a major role in the six-part Omega Men limited series (2006-2007).\n\n\n=== R.E.B.E.L.S. (second series) ===\n\nIn 2009, R.E.B.E.L.S. returned as an ongoing series. According to writer Tony Bedard he originally \&quot;pitched it as L.E.G.I.O.N. and then the Legion of Super-Heroes exploded.... We needed a title to emphasize that, despite the distant connection to the Legion, this is its own book. We didn\u2019t have to look far.\&quot;The new series opens with Dox a wanted criminal on the run from a L.E.G.I.O.N. made up of robotic constructs controlled by Silica, a living computer Dox had designed.  While a robot-based, computer-controlled L.E.G.I.O.N. had made it easier for Dox to control the behavior of his police force throughout the 80 worlds under their protection (a common complaint of his in the first series), it also enabled the Star Conqueror (a.k.a. Starro) to wrest control of L.E.G.I.O.N. from Dox and make himself the de facto ruler of all the client worlds just by corrupting Silica.  The first issues show Dox building his team based on instructions smuggled to him by Brainiac Five, a team that will be the prototype of the future Legion of Super-Heroes.\n\n\n=== The New 52 ===\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#39;s continuity. In this new timeline, L.E.G.I.O.N. still exists, but it is unclear how much of its history remains intact. L.E.G.I.O.N. officers make a brief appearance in the Larfleeze backup story in Threshold #3. Stealth, a L.E.G.I.O.N. member in previous continuity, also appears in the main storyline of Threshold, although she is not affiliated with the organization.\n\n\n== List of characters ==\n\n\n=== Founding members ===\nVril Dox II (Genius Coluan; founder and team leader; clone of Vril Dox, the original Brainiac)\nThe Durlan (nameless shapeshifting alien from the planet Durla, old friend of Dox; later revealed to be Legion of Super-Heroes benefactor R.

Brande)\nStrata (powerful crystalline female from the planet Dryad)\nStealth (female alien from Gryx)\nGarryn Bek (ex-policeman from Cairn)\nLyrissa Mallor (champion of Talok VIII, ancestor of Shadow Lass)\n\n\n=== Later members ===\nLobo (Czarnian bounty-hunter)\nPhase (mysterious female from 30th century with power to \&quot;phase\&quot; through solid objects; originally, she was Phantom Girl of the Legion of Super-Heroes; after Zero Hour, retconned to be Apparition&#39;s second self; status unknown in current continuity)\nLar Gand (Daxamite who later becomes known as Valor)\nLady Quark (co-ruler and lone survivor of Earth-Six, which was destroyed during the Crisis)\nCaptain Comet (mutant metahuman with advanced powers)\nTelepath (last survivor of a hive-dwelling race from the planet Zsiglon; aka Qi&#39;Qi)\nMarij&#39;n Bek (Cairnian wife of Garryn Bek)\nGarv (powerful male alien, becomes Strata&#39;s lover)\nAmon Hakk (Khundian recruit)\nBertron Diib (impervious alien recruit from Diibworld)\nBorb Borbb (alien recruit with teleportation powers)\nDarius (android recruit created on Acheron)\nZena Moonstruk (shy alien recruit with the power to absorb light and emit it as energy blasts)\nIg&#39;nea (female recruit with pyrotechnic powers)\nLydea Mallor (Lyrissa Mallor&#39;s daughter)\nDavroth Catto (arrogant recruit from the planet Oziman with power of flight)\nLayla (female humanoid who acquires powers in the Bloodlines crossover)\nGigantus (diminutive champion of Motus)\nLyrl Dox (super-intelligent son of Vril Dox and Stealth)\nTaptree (plantlike alien)\n\n\n=== Deceased members ===\nLyrissa Mallor\nBertron Diib\nIg&#39;nea\n\n\n=== Current members ===\nVril Dox\nTribulus\nBounder\nCiji\nWildstar\nAmon Hakk\nGarv\nAdam Strange\nCaptain Comet\nXylon\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDCU Guide: R.E.B.E.L.S.&quot;</span>
