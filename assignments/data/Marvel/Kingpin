[http://www.comicbooked.com/top-5-enemies-of-daredevil \"The Top 5 Enemies of Daredevil\"]. comicbooked.com</ref> as well as a recurring foe of the [[Punisher]]. The Kingpin's traditional attire consists of his signature white suit jacket and cane, though his appearance has been changed over the years. In all iterations, the Kingpin is depicted as having an extraordinarily heavyset appearance; while many regard him as fat, particularly Spider-Man, in reality most of his mass consists of muscle, which, combined with his training in physical combat, makes him a very dangerous foe to face in person.\n\nThe character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including films, television series and video games. He has been portrayed by [[John Rhys-Davies]] in 1989's ''[[The Trial of the Incredible Hulk]]'', [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] in 2003's ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] web series ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', and voiced by [[Liev Schreiber]] in the 2018 animated film, ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.

A series of appearances in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' by writer/penciler [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] depicted the Kingpin as a scheming, cold-blooded crimelord who consistently stayed beyond the reach of the law. This remained the character's dominant form for decades<ref name=\"Comtois30\"/> as the Kingpin became widely regarded as Daredevil's [[archenemy]].<ref name=\"top 5 enemies of Daredevil\"/> He continues to be a recurring opponent of [[Spider-Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWilson Fisk began his life as a poor child in [[New York City]], bullied by his classmates due to his obesity. Fisk began training himself in physical combat, using his new-found strength to intimidate the bullies into joining his gang. He was eventually discovered by crimelord Don Rigoletto, and became the man's bodyguard and right-hand man. Eventually, Fisk killed his boss and took control of the gangster's criminal empire, becoming one of the most powerful figures in New York's underworld.<ref>''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #-1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile the Kingpin enjoyed a long tenure in his new position, he had made enemies such as the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime syndicate and the terrorist group [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. The two groups teamed together to oppose Fisk, causing him to flee to [[Japan]]. There, he started a [[spice]] business in order to regain his wealth. After earning enough money, Fisk returned to New York and started gang wars in an attempt to bring down the Maggia. With the criminal world in chaos, Fisk was able to step in and take back control.{{issue|date=January 2015}}\n\nFisk attempted a coalition of the New York mobs after hearing that Spider-Man had apparently gone out of action and ordered the abduction of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], but was foiled by [[Spider-Man]] in his first confrontation with the web-slinger.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50-52. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile Fisk was a powerful crimelord, he posed as a legitimate businessman, one who made donations to [[charitable organization|charities]], and seemed like a generous, wealthy man. He eventually met and then married a woman named [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa]], with whom he had a son: [[Richard Fisk]]. Vanessa did not know that Fisk was a criminal when they married. Vanessa (having found out) threatened to leave him if he did not give up his life of crime. He retired from crime, and the family moved back to Japan.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #170-171. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nRichard did not find out that his father was a criminal until [[college]]. After graduating, Richard told his parents he would travel through [[Europe]]. Only months later, they received news that Richard (who was angry after learning the truth about his father) had died in a [[ski|skiing accident]]. However, it turned out that Richard was still alive and masqueraded as a rival crimelord known as the Schemer, intent on toppling his father as the Kingpin of Crime.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #83-85\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83-85. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFisk contended against his rival gang leader, the Schemer, and battled Spider-Man in this encounter.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #83-85\"/>\n\nAt one point, he became the manager and director of a Las Vegas-based fragment of HYDRA.<ref name=\"Captain America' 1972\">''Captain America'' #147-148 (March\u2013April 1972).

His wife Vanessa was then kidnapped by said lieutenants who put out a contract on his life. After he witnessed Vanessa's apparent death, he returned to a life of crime. He regained control of the New York mobs because he had built them up in the first place and knew how to damage them; promises to keep the East Coast stable kept Midwestern crimelords happy and allowed him room to move. The Kingpin also gained [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]'s loyalty by promising steady work. The files were taken by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]; the Kingpin encouraged Daredevil to turn them over to the police as that would allow him to replace the arrested crimelords that much swifter. Daredevil did not turn them over because this would slow down the Kingpin's plans.<ref>''Daredevil'' #170-172 (May\u2013June 1981).

Daredevil found Vanessa alive but amnesiac and returned Vanessa to him in exchange for his abandoning the Cherryh scheme. As retribution for this, he sent Elektra to kill [[Foggy Nelson]] (Daredevil's friend) but Elektra failed and was killed by Bullseye.<ref>''Daredevil'' #177-178 and #180-181. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Kingpin learned Daredevil's secret identity through information passed on from [[Karen Page]], Daredevil's ex-girlfriend who was now a pornographic film actress. The Kingpin used his influence to [[Daredevil: Born Again|destroy]] Matt Murdock's civilian and professional life. Enamored with the results of his own scheme, he became increasingly obsessed with Daredevil. This led to (among other events) brutalizing the reporter [[Ben Urich]], having his employees (such as [[James Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]] and [[Felix Manning]]) assaulting bribed policeman [[Nick Manolis]] and sending the homicidal patriot [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] into Hell's Kitchen. The last incident killed dozens of people, and the Kingpin was implicated. Though he avoided prison, his reputation was destroyed.<ref>''Daredevil: Born Again'' / ''Daredevil'' #227-233 (February\u2013August 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nKingpin was sought out by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] (who was dating Spider-Man at the time) and feared a lack of powers would make the woman a liability to him. Black Cat paid Fisk to have scientists provide defensive bad luck powers that cause mishap to befall anyone who attempts to harm Black Cat in combat but also hurt and eventually kill anyone who stays nearby. The Kingpin hoped this would lead to Spider-Man's death, but Spider-Man and the Black Cat ultimately broke up instead. Shortly after, Fisk was attacked by Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #100 (March 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref> Fisk's scientists also created the supervillains the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]] and the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] to battle Spider-Man and the Black Cat.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\n===1990s===\nFisk later rehires Bullseye to investigate a New York drug war and survives an assassination attempt by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. In retaliation, he sends Bullseye to assassinate the [[Red Skull]] (Crossbones's employer). The attempt fails, and the Kingpin instead defeats the Red Skull (in a clone of Captain America's body) in personal combat.<ref>''Captain America'' #373 and #376-378 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFisk subsequently begins his own cable television station, partnering with an apparent Texas millionaire that the Kingpin thinks can be easily manipulated. However, the millionaire was actually bait planted by HYDRA. Learning of this from [[Nick Fury]], Daredevil spread the word through the underworld that the Kingpin had become a stooge of HYDRA, weakening his power. HYDRA steals the vast majority of his assets, bombs his businesses across New York City, and sends a helicopter gunship to attack his skyscraper offices. With his empire crumbling, the Kingpin is indicted on federal charges, and Daredevil tricks him into committing assault and battery at Manhattan's [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]]. Bailed out of jail by a rival who intends to use him as an errand boy, Fisk loses what remains of his sanity, murders his rival, and becomes a fugitive.<ref>''Daredevil'' #297-300.

Marvel Comics.</ref> However, his plan backfires when Daredevil convinces Maya of the truth, and Lopez shoots the Kingpin in the eyes in retaliation, rendering him blind.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #15 (April 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> Fisk eventually loses his criminal empire to [[Samuel Silke]] (one of his employees who works with Richard) in a bloody assassination bid, using the Kingpin's new status as a blind man to rally supporters.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the aftermath, Vanessa kills Richard and flees the country with Fisk's remaining wealth while the Kingpin recuperates in an unnamed East European country, broken and alone. He is given an eye transplant which restores his eyesight.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #46. Marvel Comics.</ref> He eventually confronts Silke and fatally crushes the man's head, almost manages to regain his empire through sheer will, but is defeated by Daredevil (who declares himself the new Kingpin). Fisk is imprisoned as a result.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #50 (October 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe later hatches a scheme to be freed and regain his wealth by giving the FBI proof in the form of the nonexistent \"Murdock Papers\" that Murdock is Daredevil. Having made so many enemies in prison, Fisk is constantly under attack from the Hand, HYDRA, and any number of criminal organizations with which he had had dealings. The U.S. government is hard-pressed to get rid of this expensive, dangerous, legally clean master criminal, and Fisk succeeds in manipulating the FBI into gravely wounding Daredevil and providing them a sample of Daredevil's DNA.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} He tells Ben Urich to give the federal government the location of the [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]], the only medic for injured superheroes, or go to jail.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #79 (January 2006).

Finally, Murdock sacrifices the deal, refusing to let Bullseye (who was also incarcerated) leave the prison as the Kingpin had planned. The fight ends with the Kingpin shot point-blank in the knee by gunfire from Bullseye intended for Murdock, while Murdock escapes.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #86-87 (August - September 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFisk appears in the 2006 ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]: War Crimes'' one-shot issue, in which he offers information about [[Captain America]]'s Resistance base to [[Iron Man]], the leader of the [[2006 Superhuman Registration Act|pro-Registration]] forces in exchange for a reduced sentence. But as his status in prison is threatened for collaborating with Iron Man, he betrays Iron Man.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} He then puts out a hit on Spider-Man's loved ones after Iron Man convinced Peter Parker to publicly reveal himself as a means of demonstrating support for the Superhuman Registration Act. This results in [[Aunt May|May Parker]] being gravely wounded by a sniper's attempt to kill Spider-Man. After tracing the event back to Kingpin, Spider-Man confronts the Kingpin in prison and badly beats him in front of his fellow inmates. Spider-Man decides to let the Kingpin live with the humiliation of his defeat, news of which will quickly spread through the Underworld. Parker vows, however, to kill the Kingpin if May dies.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #538-542 (May\u2013August 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMurdock returns to the United States with a cleared name and completes Vanessa's last wish and takes on Fisk's case, getting all charges dropped in exchange for Fisk leaving the country, giving up his American citizenship and his agreement to end his vendetta with Daredevil. Although the charges were dropped due to the evidence being deemed inadmissible in court, Murdock delays the case enough so Fisk is unable to attend his wife's funeral. The mournful Fisk is later seen visiting his wife's grave, before temporarily returning to New York to resolve some loose ends.<ref name=deadendkids>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #25-30.

He makes a deal with the Runaways to secure a mysterious object for him in exchange for protection from the government. He and his army of ninjas are defeated when the Runaways refuse to give it to him after stealing the object, discovering what Fisk wanted was a device invented by the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]. It is later revealed that Fisk was hired by elderly woman Lillie McGurty who orchestrated the events so the Runaways can travel back to 1907 and ensure that the woman would come back to the present with them, which her past self declined.<ref name=deadendkids/>\n\nIn the 2007 \"[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]\" storyline, which ends with the undoing from history of Peter and [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s marriage and Spider-Man's real identity public revelation, all memories on the part of the public that Spider-Man is Peter is removed, including the Kingpin's.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}\n\nDuring the 2008 \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline, the Kingpin forms an alliance with [[Lady Bullseye]] to destroy Daredevil. He orders Lady Bullseye to disguise herself as a member of the Hand and kill two corrupt cops and a judge, making it seems that Daredevil ordered this and prompting [[Norman Osborn]] as the leader of the law enforcement organization [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] to send Bullseye in retaliation. Though Daredevil survives the fight with Bullseye, the Kingpin is undeterred and states that he has Daredevil \"where he wants [his nemesis]\".<ref>''Dark Reign: The List - Daredevil'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Kingpin has also targeted Daredevil's friends to frame Osborn for their recent misfortunes to further his attempts on manipulating Daredevil's actions. He has Nelson disbarred as an attorney for standing up to a judge on his payroll for an unfair ruling of overturning a jury's verdict. He also causes the loss of [[Dakota North (comics)|Dakota North]]'s private investigator license.<ref>''Daredevil''#502-504. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the 2009 ''Daredevil'' arc \"[[Return of the King (comics)|Return of the King]]\", it is revealed that the Kingpin has spent the past year living a normal life in a small Spanish fishing village. There he meets and falls in love with Marta, a young mother of two. He finds himself trying to overcome his former life as a crimelord, only to later find Marta and the two kids murdered by Lady Bullseye and the Hand who then brutally attack him, stabbing him through the shoulders with two katanas. When he asks why, Lady Bullseye replies, \"The reasons are far too numerous, but if you want a specific cause, ask Daredevil\".<ref>''Daredevil'' #116. Marvel Comics.</ref> In his revenge against the Hand, the Kingpin frees and recruits the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] to help him. Fisk begins experiencing hallucinations of his dead wife who taunts him. It turns out that Fisk's actual plan is to take the leadership of the Hand, after killing Hiroshi, the ninja-lord who ordered the family's assassinations. However, he is thwarted by Daredevil who takes the lead for himself.<ref>''Daredevil'' #118-119 and #500.

The Kingpin's Shadowland hideout is attacked by the Superior Spider-Man to which the Kingpin claims that the Superior Spider-Man is much different than the nemesis he had fought. While escaping, the Kingpin kills his doppelg\u00e4nger Smedley Kornfeld (who was hired for events like this) in order to fool the Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWith his power over New York gone, Fisk set up shop in San Francisco, with the intention of rebuilding his empire there. But the vigilante [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] acted first, taking control of the local gangs and kidnapped the Owl who also relocated to San Francisco. He transformed Owlsley into a super-computer capable of taking control of all wifi signals in order to locate his former girlfriend [[Julia Carpenter]]. During this time, Daredevil confirmed his secret identity, taking a positive approach to it this time and moved to San Francisco to practice law and continue his superhero career. Fisk began to make moves against both of his enemies, hiring the assassin Ikari to kidnap Foggy and Matt's new girlfriend, Kirsten McDuffie, and having his men look for Julia to have leverage against the Shroud. However, the Shroud and Daredevil came into conflict when he and Jubua Pride, the Owl's daughter, attempted to free Owlsley. The Shroud then released all private information about Daredevil's law practice's clients. Daredevil went to Fisk and offered him a deal, he would use his resources to fix his situation and assure Foggy and Kirsten are safe, and in exchange Matt Murdock would fake his death and get a new identity only Fisk would know, giving Kingpin back the power to destroy Daredevil, which he lost when he went public. However, Fisk went with his original plan instead and Ikari kidnapped Nelson and Kirsten. Meanwhile, the Shroud, Pride, and Daredevil crashed when they attempted to get Julia at an airport, allowing Kingpin's goons to take her. Fisk presented his hostages when Daredevil confronted him and had him fight Ikari to the death, with Fisk killing one of them if Daredevil wins. The fight took them to the streets, where the Shroud saved Daredevil and killed Ikari. Improvising, Daredevil took Ikari's costume and claimed to have killed the hero while the Shroud had the Owl bring to light all of Fisk's operations in exchange for his freedom. While Kingpin and Daredevil fought, the federals stormed his building.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter HYDRA's defeat, Wilson Fisk is able to use a subsequent mayoral election to put himself forward as a last-minute candidate, avoiding his criminal past being drawn into the issue by simply ignoring questions about it, aided by the fact that he has never been legitimately charged with anything. With his primary policy being a bill to declare all vigilantes as criminals, and despite Daredevil's own recent efforts to create a precedent for superheroes testifying under their secret identities in Washington, he is able to have Daredevil arrested in an FBI sting operation, mocking his old nemesis with the knowledge that the people he protects chose Fisk to 'protect' ''them'', prompting Daredevil to break a window and leap out of Fisk's office to begin his own efforts to bring down Fisk's empire. Matt Murdock then applied for the position of deputy mayor.<ref>''Daredevil'' #595.

When the Sinister Syndicate is formed, Mayor Fisk gives them their first mission to capture Boomerang who has stolen something from him. When the Sinister Syndicate catches Boomerang, Beetle contacts Mayor Fisk as she is given information on where the exchange should happen. As the Sinister Syndicate plans to adjourn for the night, they hear Mayor Fisk outside stating that they are harboring a criminal and are to surrender Boomerang to him or suffer the full might of New York City. The Syndicate notices the police, the SWAT Team, the Anti-Super Squad, and low-level bureaucrats. Spider-Man arrives as well and tries to get Mayor Fisk to have the authorities stand down only for Mayor Fisk to claim that Spider-Man fell prey to Boomerang's hypnotic boomerang. Electro claims that Spider-Man is buying them some time. After reading the paper in Boomerang's hand that belonged to Mayor Fisk, Beetle tells the Syndicate that they should let Boomerang go. While Beetle claimed that she betrayed them, she did it because she's a supervillain and states that she plans to have Mayor Fisk deputize them. The rest of the Syndicate is not up with this plan. The Syndicate then assists Spider-Man against Mayor Fisk's forces. Beetle has Spider-Man evacuate Boomerang while the Syndicate fights Mayor Fisk's forces while not killing them. The Syndicate is defeated and arrested by the police.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #25-28. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMayor Wilson Fisk was reunited with his Miles Morales who has become Ultimatum.

Most of his body mass is actually muscle that has been built to extraordinary size, much like a Super Heavyweight [[sumo|sumo wrestler]], or some [[Olympic weightlifting|Olympic weightlifters]] and [[Powerlifting|powerlifters]] but at greater strength levels. He has been shown to be strong enough to hurl large men across a room,{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and leave imprints in concrete walls after punching them.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #69, Marvel Comics</ref> Defying his size, the Kingpin is a master of many forms of armed and unarmed combat, especially sumo wrestling. His signature move is the [[bear hug]]. He has fought [[Captain America]] to a standstill in hand-to-hand combat.<ref name=\"Captain America' 1972\"/> His daily workout typically consists of simultaneously overcoming five or more trained martial artists with his bare hands;<ref>''Daredevil'' #170, Marvel Comics</ref> he stores his valuables in a safe which has no lock, only a door which is so heavy that only the Kingpin himself is strong enough to open it.<ref>''Daredevil'' #171, Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nHe typically wears [[Kevlar]] armor under his clothing. Fisk sometimes carries an \"obliterator cane\", a walking stick that conceals a laser weapon that can vaporize a handgun or a person's head at close range. He typically wears an ornamental diamond stick-pin that conceals compressed sleeping gas that is effective if sprayed into a victim's face. Due to his wealth and intellectual industry, Kingpin could use far more advanced paraphernalia, but he prefers to use such things as a last resort. As Fisk became less Spider-Man's enemy and more Daredevil's, he became more of a [[realism (arts)|naturalistic]] mafioso than a comic book criminal mastermind, and depended less on [[science fiction]]-like weaponry.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe United States government is aware of the Kingpin's crimes but has never been able to prove his involvement. Members of the government have worked with him when necessary (even while describing him as \"the devil\"), such as when they needed his help to dispose of a Manhattan office building that the [[Beyonder]] turned into gold.<ref>\"Gold Rush!\", ''Web of Spider-Man'' #6 (September 1985); \"This Gold Is Mine!\", ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #268 (September 1985), Marvel Comics</ref> The Kingpin's willpower is so great that he can resist even the [[Purple Man]]'s mind control.<ref>\"Pawns of the Purple Man!\" ''Marvel Team-Up Annual'' #4 1981</ref> He is intellectually formidable and is a master tactician and a highly skilled planner and organizer.

He is extremely skilled and knowledgeable in the organization and management of criminal and legal business operations.\n\n==Other versions==\n*In ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' universe, Wilson Fisk is a pirate captain of the HMS ''Vanessa'', known as the King's Pin, who attacks the ship taking Peter Parquarh and Sir Norman Osborne back to England.{{issue|date=May 2012}} However, although his attack injures Osborne, he is able to take the ship when Peter deflects the cannonballs by using his webbing to throw them back at the ''Vanessa''. Fisk is thrown into the sea when he confronts the captain directly, even rejecting Fisk's 'offer' to explain how he got his name.{{issue|date=May 2012}}\n*In the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline, Wilson Fisk is known as Dirigible, a wealthy businessman who bought his way into the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a human terrorist group serving [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] that makes up for their lack of mutant powers using technology which allows them to fly and emit explosive blasts.{{Issue|date=March 2011}} Dirigible is clearly the leader of the group, as he is seen giving orders to his three teammates.

However, unlike his traditional depictions, he lacks self-confidence, is emotionally unstable, and initially does not adopt the Kingpin moniker.

When one of his associates, Nikolas Natchios, decides to leave, Fisk hires [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to kill him and frame him as the Kingpin, and later to kill Natchios' daughter, [[Elektra (character)|Elektra]]. Bullseye kills both, and admits to Daredevil that Fisk is the real Kingpin. Daredevil defeats Bullseye and confronts Fisk. The two fight and Fisk initially gains the upper hand, but Daredevil breaks the roof, allowing the rain to pour in and improve his vision, enabling him to fight back and break Fisk's legs. Though Daredevil nearly kills Fisk in retaliation for murdering the former's father, [[Jack Murdock (comics)|Jack Murdock]], for refusing to throw a boxing match, Daredevil spares his life. Fisk threatens to reveal Daredevil's identity in prison, but is put off when Daredevil counters that he would basically be admitting to being defeated by a blind man. As the police approach, Fisk vows revenge, and a newspaper article later shows that Fisk has been exposed as the real Kingpin.\n* The Kingpin appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', voiced by [[Liev Schreiber]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-trailer-1202833788/|title='Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' Casts Hailee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali and Lily Tomlin|website=Variety|last=Nyrem|first=Erin|date=June 6, 2018|accessdate=June 6, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606163029/https://variety.com/2018/film/news/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-trailer-1202833788/|archivedate=June 6, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This version is [[Alchemax]]'s benefactor and has various supervillains under his employ, including the [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Prowler]], the [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Green Goblin]], the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]].

As such, Kingpin is one of Spider-Man's oldest adversaries, and the two have fought on numerous occasions over the course of the latter's eight-year career. In addition to being an exceptional criminal mastermind, Fisk is also depicted as being a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, as he easily overpowered and severely injured Spider-Man during their first fight. The first mission of the game sees Spider-Man helping the police raid Fisk Tower and capture him, having finally obtained enough evidence against Fisk. Upon being defeated by Spider-Man, Fisk is imprisoned at the maximum security prison, the [[Raft (comics)|Raft]]. Following this, crime rates skyrocket as several criminals, such as [[Mister Negative]], attempt to fill the power vacuum. Despite being locked up, Fisk continues to maintain a number of fronts throughout the city, allowing him to continue financing his criminal empire, though Spider-Man helps the police find and dismantle them once he finds out.\n* Two playable versions of the Kingpin (\"Wilson Fisk\" and \"Spider-Verse\") appear in the match-three mobile game ''[[Marvel Puzzle Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dinh |first=Christine |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/this-week-in-marvel-games-your-favorite-marvel-games-swing-into-the-spider-verse|title=This Week in Marvel Games: Your Favorite Marvel Games Swing Into the Spider-Verse|publisher=[[Marvel.com]]|date=December 13, 2018|accessdate=March 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Theater===\nIn the play ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'', Fisk is seen robbing a bank with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] before being thwarted by Spider-Man.\n\n=== Tabletop games ===\n\n* Kingpin has been featured in [[HeroClix|Heroclix]] Collectible Miniatures Game.\n* Kingpin has been announced for [[Marvel Crisis Protocol]] Miniatures Game<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lara|first=Rene|date=August 5, 2020|title=Daredevil, She-Hulk, Punisher y otros llegan a Marvel Crisis Protocol|work=Wargarage.org|url=http://wargarage.org/noticia/daredevil-she-hulk-punisher-y-otros-llegan-a-marvel-crisis-protocol/|url-status=live|access-date=August 5, 2020}}</ref>.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=850|title=Kingpin}}\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Kingpin Kingpin] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/kingpin.html Kingpin's Profile at Spiderfan.org]\n\n{{Daredevil}}\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Punisher}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kingpin}}\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita Sr.]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Daredevil (Marvel Comics) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional crime bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional hapkido practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional judoka]]\n[[Category:Fictional jujutsuka]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional sumo wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Hydra agents]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics film characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics television characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]"}]}}}}
