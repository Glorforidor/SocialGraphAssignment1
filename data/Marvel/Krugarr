The character was co-created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], and first appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Strange Tales]]&#39;&#39; #110 (July 1963).\n\nDebuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] of comics, the character has featured in several self-titled series and Marvel-endorsed products including arcade and [[video game]]s; [[animated]] [[television series]]; a [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] film; and merchandise such as [[trading cards]].\n\nIn addition to his [[Marvel Universe|mainstream]] incarnation, Doctor Strange has had been depicted in other [[fictional universes]].\n\n==1602==\nSet in the [[Marvel 1602]] universe. Sir Stephen Strange, both the court physician of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] and a magician, senses that there are unnatural forces at work. He is the replacement in the 1602 universe for [[John Dee]] and is married to a version of Clea. Here, he cannot use his &#39;Astral Projection&#39; (which he refers to as a magic mirror) as well as the modern one could, lacking modern materials, and is often physically drained after it is finished, and lacks memory of what he saw in astral form. During this time, he makes indirect contact with [[Uatu]], who warns him about the danger caused by the &#39;Forerunner&#39;s&#39; arrival in the past, but is placed under a compulsion not to speak or act on this knowledge. Eventually, when Elizabeth is dead, he allows himself to be executed for witchcraft and treason so that his head, kept alive by Clea for some time after his execution, can continue to be of help by sharing the information he has gained from Uatu with the other heroes so that they can prevent the destruction of reality.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\n==2099==\nSet in the [[Marvel 2099]] universe. The Sorceress Supreme of Earth is a young woman who calls herself \&quot;Strange\&quot;. She secretly shares her body with a monstrous demon. She is very inexperienced in her powers and uses them recklessly. In one incident, she causes the death of her brother. Her main opponent is [[Garokk]] who wishes to use her past torments and inexperience to gain the title of Sorcerer Supreme for himself.&lt;ref&gt;\&quot;2099 World Of Tomorrow\&quot; #2 (October 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nIn a &#39;reset&#39; 2099 timeline where the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]] has conquered a decimated world, he apparently kept Strange contained in a mystical circle.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Man 2099&#39;&#39; vol.2 #9&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Spider-Man 2099|Miguel O&#39;Hara]] emerged into this timeline and released Strange, she claimed that the demon possessing her protected her from major world-shifts, working with Miguel to repair an old time machine of Doctor Doom&#39;s so that he could return to 2015 and avert this timeline. However, after Miguel&#39;s departure, Strange revealed that she was working with the Maestro and was under the control of the demon within her.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Spider-Man 2099&#39;&#39; vol.2 #10&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nStrange later appears on [[Battleworld]] as a member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders 2099]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Secret Wars 2099&#39;&#39; #2&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nWhen Miguel returns to a new variation of the 2099 timeline where having superpowers is illegal, he witnesses Strange&#39;s demon being banished from her body with Moon Knight using a soul sword.\n\n==Age of X==\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Age of X]]&#39;&#39; timeline, Doctor Strange poses as a Mutant-hunter for hire, but is in reality a double agent working with [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], who teleports mutants to Fortress X for safety.\n\n==Amalgam Comics==\nSet in the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, Dr. Strange was combined with [[Doctor Fate]] and [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] into &#39;&#39;[[Dr. Strangefate]]&#39;&#39;. As the only character aware of the nature of the Amalgam Universe, he was the chief opponent of [[Access (comics)|Access]], who was attempting to separate the [[DC Universe|DC]] and [[Marvel Universe]]s. Originally numbered as Earth-962.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Doctor Strangefate&#39;&#39; #1 (April 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Bullet Points==\nIn the mini-series &#39;&#39;[[Bullet Points (comics)|Bullet Points]]&#39;&#39;, Dr. Strange chooses to work for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], rather than seek out the [[Ancient One]], in exchange for them restoring his hands. Later he is seen possessing claws similar to Wolverine&#39;s.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Bullet Points&#39;&#39; #2-5 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==&#39;&#39;Duckworld&#39;&#39;==\nSet in [[Howard the Duck]]&#39;s home-world and home dimension. This version of Doctor Strange is Ducktor Strange, an [[anthropomorphic]] Duck. In this reality, he is still a Sorcerer (the \&quot;Mallard of the Mystic Arts\&quot;), but is also a drunken derelict, who seems to live in alleys drinking \&quot;sorcerous sauce\&quot; (alcohol). He has appeared in &#39;&#39;Howard the Duck&#39;&#39; magazine #6 (July 1980), wherein he sends Howard and Beverly back to Earth; and in &#39;&#39;[[She-Hulk]]&#39;&#39;, vol. 4, #20 (Sept 2007), wherein he helps Stu the Intern return to Earth (since Stu&#39;s extensive knowledge of Marvel Comics continuity reminded him that he could find the Ducktor and how he could be returned by the Mystic Mallard).\n\n==Earth-A/Earth-721==\nIn &#39;&#39;She-Hulk&#39;&#39; (vol. 2) #21, a non-powered counterpart of Dr. Strange from Earth-A comes to Earth-616 (aka Earth-B) and impersonates the 616 Dr. Strange. The impostor is revealed when he can&#39;t think of a rhyme for the word \&quot;Cyttorak\&quot;.\n\n==&#39;&#39;Earth X&#39;&#39;==\nSet in the [[Earth X]] universe. Dr. Strange&#39;s body is murdered by Clea (this Earth&#39;s Sorceress Supreme) under the behest of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. His astral form aids [[Mahr Vehl|Captain Marvel]] in his journey through Death&#39;s Realm as one of the few inhabiting heroes aware of his death.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n==&#39;&#39;Exiles&#39;&#39;==\nAn alternative Dr. Strange helped the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] briefly. This character was not a mystic, but instead was still a practicing physician who specialized in superhumans. This version of Doctor Strange was killed by an alternative version of [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Exiles&#39;&#39; #63-65&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==&#39;&#39;Fantastic Four: The End&#39;&#39;==\nIn this series, Dr. Strange is now the Ancient One and had a daughter with Clea who is the new Dr. Strange.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Fantastic Four: The End&#39;&#39; #3 (Feb 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==&#39;&#39;Guardians of the Galaxy&#39;&#39;==\nIn the alternative future of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], Dr. Strange assumed the title of the Ancient One (previously held by his mentor) and took on a disciple of his own, a Lem named [[Krugarr]]. Strange/the Ancient One was eventually killed by Dormammu, who was defeated by the combined efforts of Krugarr, his disciple [[Talon (Marvel Comics)|Talon]], and the Guardians.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Guardians of the Galaxy&#39;&#39; #36-37&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==&#39;&#39;Marvel Zombies&#39;&#39;==\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Zombies]]&#39;&#39; universe, Dr. Strange is one of the last heroes in the alternative \&quot;zombie world\&quot; to be transformed into a zombie. He was last seen in living form as part of [[Nick Fury]]&#39;s resistance to defeat the zombified Marvel superheroes in the spinoff &#39;&#39;Dead Days&#39;&#39; before he and the rest of the surviving superheroes are later overwhelmed by the zombie [[Fantastic Four]] and turned.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&#39;&#39; #1 (July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He participates in the multi-zombie attack on [[Doctor Doom]]&#39;s castle, in an effort to capture and devour the unaffected Latverian citizens inside.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Zombies Vs. The Army Of Darkness&#39;&#39; #5&lt;/ref&gt; While part of a multi-zombie chase of Ultimate [[Reed Richards]], he vanishes under a rain of cars launched by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimate Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; #22&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later resurfaces in &#39;&#39;[[Marvel Zombies 3]]&#39;&#39; but with limited function as a result of Magneto&#39;s wrath. He is part of [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]&#39;s undead alliance and can only perform two spells, one of which allows viewers to see into other universes which becomes an essential tool to Kingpin&#39;s plans. Ultron kills Zombie Dr. Strange.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Marvel Zombies 3&#39;&#39; #3&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==MC2==\nSet in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe. Dr. Strange is retired and the title of [[Sorcerer Supreme]] has been passed to the younger [[Doc Magus]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;A-Next\&quot; #3 (December 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==&#39;&#39;Mutant X&#39;&#39;==\nSet in the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe. Dr. Strange was the [[Man-Thing]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mutant X Annual 1999&#39;&#39; #1 (May 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The title of Sorcerer Supreme had been taken by Mordo.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Mutant X&#39;&#39; #32 (June 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==&#39;&#39;Spider-Ham&#39;&#39;==\nSet in the [[Spider-Ham#Other characters|Larval zooniverse]], the [[funny animal]] version of Doctor Strange is Croctor Strange, an [[anthropomorphic]] [[crocodile]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham&#39;&#39; #4 (Nov 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==&#39;&#39;Thor: Vikings&#39;&#39;==\nDr. Strange assists Thor in the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] mini series &#39;&#39;[[Thor: Vikings]]&#39;&#39;, when zombified, evil Vikings massacre Manhattan by pillaging and killing its citizens. Strange helps Thor locate the descendants of a victim that the Vikings had slain, just after the victim, a village wiseman had placed a curse on the Vikings that caused them to become zombified. With Strange&#39;s instruction, the battle-experienced descendants all fight the Vikings with Thor.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Thor: Vikings&#39;&#39; #1-5 (Sept 2003-Jan 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Ultimate Marvel==\nSet in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe. First appearing in flashbacks, Dr. Stephen Strange married his former student, Clea, and the two of them had a child, Stephen, Jr. Strange Sr. later vanished, and Clea decided to raise Stephen, Jr. away from magic.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nAs a college student, Stephen Jr. was approached by Wong, who told him about his father and took him on as a student. He supports himself as a new-age guru to the rich, powerful and famous, and is seen as a celebrity, appearing on television talk shows. He is known to the public as \&quot;Dr. Strange\&quot;, although he does not hold a medical degree or doctorate. He has bemoaned his lack of knowledge in things mystical and usually, just barely saves the day with one last desperate, untried spell. Starting in &#39;&#39;Ultimate Spider-Man&#39;&#39; #107, this Doctor Strange is a member of Daredevil&#39;s team fighting against the Kingpin, the [[Marvel Knights#Ultimate Knights|Ultimate Knights]]. In &#39;&#39;Ultimatum&#39;&#39;, Strange is gruesomely killed by [[Dormammu]] when [[Ultimate Hulk]] rampages through his house.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Ultimatum: Fantastic Four Requiem&#39;&#39; #1 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; \n\nThe title of \&quot;Sorcerer Supreme\&quot; was only self-proclaimed by the elder Strange as reported in the comics during a TV news broadcast.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n==Marvel Cinematic Universe==\nIn this shared universe of interconnected films designated as [[Earth-199999]], Doctor Strange is played by English actor [[Benedict Cumberbatch]].\n\nThe character&#39;s existence is first confirmed in &#39;&#39;[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]&#39;&#39; where he is mentioned by [[Jasper Sitwell]] as a target of Project: Insight alongside Bruce Banner and countless other individuals.\n\nThe character makes his onscreen debut in the [[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|eponymous film]], where his origin story is fleshed out. Brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange is involved in a car accident that permanently cripples his hands and  ends his medical career. Seeking to restore them, he tries seven different treatments each of which are unsuccessful and leading him to go bankrupt. The despondent Strange soon travels to [[Kamar-Taj]] and is trained in the Mystic Arts by the [[Ancient One]], [[Karl Mordo]] and [[Wong (comics)|Wong]] which he uses to battle a former student of the latter [[Kaecilius]], though he is unable to save the Ancient One from death, he nevertheless uses the [[Infinity Gems|Time Stone]] to save the world from Kaecilius and his master Dormammu (also played by Cumberbatch). In the end he accepts his place as the Master of the New York Sanctum.\n\nStrange later has a minor appearance in &#39;&#39;[[Thor: Ragnarok]]&#39;&#39; where he aids [[Alternative versions of Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] in finding their father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], who went missing from Asgard though he is shown to be wary of Loki due to his role in the Chitauri Invasion.\n\nStrange next appears in &#39;&#39;[[Avengers: Infinity War]]&#39;&#39; where he aids [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]], [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in battling the warlord [[Thanos]] on his home planet [[Titan (comics)|Titan]]. Strange is later forced to give up the Time Stone to Thanos in exchange for saving Iron Man&#39;s life. When Thanos assembles the Infinity Gauntlet and snaps his fingers, he wipes out half the universal population with Strange being among those erased from existence.\n\nStrange returns in &#39;&#39;Infinity War&#39;&#39;&#39;s direct sequel, &#39;&#39;[[Avengers: Endgame]]&#39;&#39;, being restored by the [[Hulk]]&#39;s snap five years later. Along with Wong and other sorcerers, he comes to open portals for the Ravegers, [[Wakanda|Wakandan]] and [[Asgard|Asgardian]] armies and the rest of the heroes to help the remaining [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their final battle against 2014 Thanos. He later reminds Stark about why he had given the Time Stone years ago and tells him this is their only chance of victory, leading to Stark sacrificing himself by using the Stones to kill Thanos and his army. Strange along with Wong later attend Stark&#39;s funeral.\n\n==Venomverse==\nA Venomized version of Doctor Strange appears in [[Venomverse]], who is responsible for gathering all of the different incarnations of Venom. His Earth was eradicated by the Poisons so he had gathered Venoms from across the multiverse in order to prevent the Poisons from consuming more of them. He is captured by the Poisons and he realises that instead of bringing more Venoms to fight, he had brought the Poisons more Venoms to consume. In the climax he sends all of the surviving Venoms to their universes while the bomb built by [[Rocket Raccoon]] explodes. His fate is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Venomverse&#39;&#39; #1&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==What If?...==\nDr. Strange also exists in several [[What If (comics)|&#39;&#39;What If?...&#39;&#39;]] [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverses]].\n*In \&quot;What If....Doctor Strange Had Been Disciple of Dormammu?\&quot;, Strange has his hands healed by Mordo and does not become a student of the Ancient One.  Mordo later converts Strange into a disciple of Dormammu.  When Strange is forced into a battle between Dormammu and the Ancient One, he decides in favor of good, and finally becomes a disciple of the Ancient One.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;What If?&#39;&#39; volume 1, #18 (Dec 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;\n*In \&quot;What If...Dr. Strange Had Not Become Master of the Mystic Arts?\&quot;, Dr. Strange never travels to Tibet, and Mordo become the Sorcerer Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;What If?&#39;&#39; volume 1, #40 (Aug 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Doctor Strange}}\n{{Marvel Multiverse}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional characters from parallel universes]]\n[[Category:Doctor Strange]]&quot;</span>
