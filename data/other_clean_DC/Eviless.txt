== Fictional character biography ==


=== Pre-Crisis ===
Eviless was introduced in Wonder Woman #10 (1944), but not formally by name until issue #28.
A slave driver from Saturn (later retconned as a subatomic earthlike world near or within Saturn), Eviless and Duke Mephisto Saturno (of the Saturnian Invasion Force) battled Wonder Woman. Although defeated by Wonder Woman, she later returned after being taken to Transformation Island. She pretended to die by controlling her heartbeat and stole the Golden Lasso. She placed a splinter in the lock of the Venus Girdle, meaning it did not affect her, though she pretended she had reformed. After taking control of a guard using the lasso, she freed several prisoners from Transformation Island (criminals previously captured by Wonder Woman) and banded them together as Villainy Inc. The team was unsuccessful against Wonder Woman, despite kidnapping her mother, and were defeated and captured.


=== Post-Crisis ===
Post-Crisis, Villainy Inc. was led by Queen Clea and the existence of Eviless has not yet been revealed, even in Post-Infinite Crisis continuity.


=== DC Rebirth ===
After the events of DC Rebirth, Eviless' history was altered. She took the name Saturna (a reference to her original name Saturnette) and became the leader of the Crimson Men, a doomsday cult. She possessed necromantic abilities, such as forming black wings on her body or controlling the dead. Saturna battled Steve Trevor and his team while investigating a mystical island inhabited by children. Steve Trevor defeated Saturna twice, the second of which left her deep within a chasm, covered with rocks. However, drops of the island's magical water fell into Saturna's unconscious mouth, implying she will return.


== Powers and abilities ==
Eviless does not appear to have any superpowers, but skillfully uses a whip to control her subjects. At times, she has appeared to put herself into a deathlike trance at will by stopping her heart.
Post-Rebirth, Saturna has an array of magical necrotic abilities.
