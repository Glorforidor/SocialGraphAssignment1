When the concubine comments on Darkseid showing a moment of weakness, Darkseid kills her and tells Desaad to remove the vocal cords from the next concubine. The conversation is witnessed by [[Forager (comics)|Forager]] of New Genesis, who is spying on them to see if Darkseid is responsible for the recent murders of the New Gods.
