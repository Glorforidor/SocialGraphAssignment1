Shapanka takes a job at [[Stark Industries]] to fund his research and attempts to steal directly from [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. After being caught and fired by Tony Stark for trying to steal from Tony Stark's secret vault, Gregor creates a suit containing cold-generating devices and is dubbed by the newspapers as \"Jack Frost.\"<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=33}}</ref> He attempts to raid Stark Industries where he captures [[Pepper Potts]] and [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]], but is defeated by Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #45 (Sept. 1963). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSeveral years later, Gregor Shapanka escaped prison and attacked Stark's Long Island industrial complex using a new far more powerful cold-generating battle suit and calling himself Blizzard. This time, Blizzard was out to steal Stark's climatron device which could be used to alter weather patterns. Blizzard nearly froze Iron Man to death, but Iron Man was rescued by Potts. Iron Man caused Blizzard's battle suit to short-circuit and then captured him.<ref>''Iron Man'' #86 \u2013 87 (Apr. \u2013 May 1976). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nGregor Shapanka obtained financing for recreating his cold-generating costume from multimillionaire [[Justin Hammer]]. Blizzard formed a partnership with two other clients of Hammer known as [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]] and the [[Melter]]. Together, the three criminals attacked a hotel casino in Atlantic City, only to be defeated by Iron Man and private bodyguard [[Bethany Cabe]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #123. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, Shapanka reconstructs his cold suit in prison. When [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] uses his electrical powers to break out of the adjoining cell, Shapanka is caught in the blast and the suit is fused to his body. Electro and Blizzard then join forces to take over the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', but are stopped by [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #56 (Apr. 1977).

Feeling alienated from humanity, Shapanka (again calling himself Jack Frost) went to live in an ice palace he created within a mountain. The [[Hulk]] found Jack Frost's new home and destroyed the ice palace. Jack Frost was seemingly killed in the collapse of his ice domain.<ref>''Hulk'' #249. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nGregor Shapanka reappeared in the guise of Blizzard. Somehow, Blizzard had lost his bodily power to generate cold and once again needed his battle suit to create low temperatures. Shapanka returned to crime and formed a gang to aid him. However, upon robbing a bank in New York City, Blizzard and his henchmen were found and defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and were taken into police custody. Thanks to his lawyer, Blizzard was soon back at large and kidnapped Bobby Saunders (a boy whom he saw speaking with Spider-Man). Through Saunders, Blizzard intended to get revenge for his most recent defeat. Blizzard mistakes a [[Iron Man 2020|villainous version of Iron Man from the year 2020]] for the modern Iron Man and attempts to ambush him. The future Iron Man however is on an urgent mission to find Bobby Saunders (who would grow up to be a terrorist in 2020) and instantly kills Blizzard with a repulsor blast.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #20 (1986).

Since Blizzard was vaporized by Iron Man 2020, Donnie adopted the name. His first mission involved working with the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] and [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]] to capture [[Force (comics)|Force]], who had betrayed Hammer. However, Blizzard was clumsy and annoyed his teammates with his amateurish mistakes (such as creating an ice wall blocking the path to their objective). After encasing Blacklash in ice, the trio fled as reinforcements arrived to protect Force.<ref>''Iron Man'' #223\u2013224. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe trio again tried to capture Force, who was protected by [[Iron Man]]. Although Blizzard fought better, when Force entered the fight, he neutralized the villains' powers. Blizzard, the Beetle, and Blacklash split up, fled and rested until their powers returned. Force found Blizzard, whose powers were ineffective against him, so Blizzard fought him with bare hands. Force repelled him, blasting him through a wall. Blizzard doggedly tried to blast Force again (despite warnings), and was electrocuted. The Beetle and Blacklash abandoned Blizzard; Chemistro blamed them for their failures, and they were arrested.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nBefore Blizzard could be jailed, he was rescued by the [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]] for Hammer. His loyalty to Hammer increased, although Iron Man tried to mentor him. Hammer negotiated with Iron Man for Blizzard, forcing the latter to help him take down the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #239\u2013240</ref> Iron Man agreed, but Blizzard refused to believe that Hammer betrayed him. After hearing a recording, Blizzard was crushed; he surrendered to Iron Man, and was saved by Chemistro and the Melter.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\n\nAfter solo missions against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]{{Issue|date=August 2009}} and the [[New Warriors]],{{Issue|date=August 2009}} attending the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M. Weapons Expo]] with several other supervillains{{Issue|date=August 2009}} and joining the largest group of the [[Masters of Evil]],{{Issue|date=August 2009}} Blizzard worked with a smaller team (including villains the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] and the daughters of the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]] and [[Batroc the Leaper]]). Their mission failed after interference from [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] and his allies.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}\n\nBlizzard attacked the [[She-Hulk]] in a bar; instead of defeating him, she invited him for a drink. Drunk, he contemplated his lack of recognition. Before collapsing in a stupor, Blizzard noted that he liked the She-Hulk. After reverting to her Jennifer Walters persona she collapsed, vomiting, on top of him.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #1 (2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWith the Avengers disbanded, the Beetle (now known as [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-IV]]) decided to form a new group of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Like the original Thunderbolts, they were former villains seeking redemption for their crimes as superheroes. Gill was one of the first members invited to join by MACH-IV, and he agreed.<ref name=\"New Thunderbolts #1\">''New Thunderbolts'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, he lacked confidence despite his desire to help people. As a Thunderbolt, Blizzard fought several enemies, including Fathom Five,<ref name=\"New Thunderbolts #1\" /> the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]],<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the [[Purple Man]].<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBlizzard and fellow Thunderbolt the [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]] became close friends. When the Speed Demon tried to commit crimes with the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], Blizzard convinced him to use his former Whizzer outfit and a tracking device. Angry with Blizzard, the Speed Demon tied him upside-down and naked on a bridge.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although doubting his status as a superhero and feeling hopeless, Blizzard gained strength from the others (especially [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], who insulted him and dismissed him from the group when she became its leader).{{Issue|date=August 2009}}\n\n[[Baron Zemo]], forming a group to fight Songbird's Thunderbolts, recruited Blizzard (who spent his days in bars after his firing by Songbird). His new teammate, the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]], enhanced Blizzard's abilities.{{Issue|date=August 2009}} He battled the Thunderbolts; the groups were soon assimilated, and Blizzard helped them against the [[U-Foes]] during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #103.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]\" storyline, Blizzard was seen with Whirlwind robbing banks when they are approached by the Spymaster. Blizzard and Whirlwind are recruited by the Spymaster to join him and his villain allies (consisting of the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]] IV, the [[Titanium Man]], the [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], and Whiplash IV) in a plot to attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower. During the briefing, Blizzard suddenly collapses.<ref>''Infinity: Heist'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Blizzard regains consciousness, he discovers that his skin has turned white. Blizzard had been exposed to the [[Terrigen Mist]]s unleashed upon the face of the entire Earth by [[Black Bolt]]. Being unknowingly an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] descendant, Blizzard experienced Terrigenesis, which causes the manifestation of his latent powers. Blizzard thought that this was his opportunity to \"be part of something bigger\" and decided to leave the Spymaster's team. However, he and Whirlwind were brutally attacked by the Spymaster and the Titanium Man when they tried to leave.<ref>''Infinity: Heist'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Blizzard and Whirlwind were forced into taking part of the assault to Stark Tower. After the Spymaster used teleporter discs to teleport some Iron Man armors to the buyers, he escaped and left Blizzard and the rest of his accomplices to be discovered by the heroes, which were using the tower as a base. They managed to defeat the heroes, and they were offered to be taken to the Spymaster by the Titanium Man. When they arrived to a spaceship where the Spymaster was, they were ambushed by him and the Titanium Man, who revealed himself as [[Captain Atlas]] of the [[Kree]] (who were the masterminds behind the heist).<ref>''Infinity: Heist'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Blizzard and the other villains managed to escape custody and started fighting the Spymaster, the Titanium Man and the army of Iron Men (controlled by the Spymaster). The actual Iron Man arrived to the spaceship, after having tracked down the armors, and helped Blizzard and his allies defeat the enemies. During the fight, Blizzard used the powers he discovered of being like a human battery to overcharge the armors and deactivate them, but he fainted and fell off the spaceship's cargo door. A suit Iron Man was controlling rescued him, but in order to let his friends escape, Blizzard froze himself and the suit. Blizzard was taken to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and was left under the simulation he had been delivered to the Inhumans in order to prove himself as the changed man Blizzard thought he was....until S.H.I.E.L.D. could know what to do with him.<ref name=\"Infinity: Heist #4\">''Infinity: Heist'' #4.

His first mission is to freeze desalinization plants in [[Abu Dhabi]], where it would leave the country with no water. It was revealed that the Mandarin had a bomb placed in Jim's neck to ensure his compliance.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #510.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Blizzard aligns himself with Iron Man, Zeke Stane, [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], and the [[Living Laser]] against the Mandarin and his Titanomechs. During the battle, Blizzard is impaled by a Titanomech.<ref name=\"Iron Man' 2012\" />\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nAll the Blizzards have similar powers, derived from their costumes. Micro-circuited cryogenic units make it possible to emit freezing rays, which lower the temperature of the surrounding air (or objects) and release ice as projectiles.\n\nDonnie Gill's costume is upgraded by supervillains the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] and the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]]. This enables even greater manipulation of cold, where Gill can encase people in snow and ice, create an ice barricade or generate \"ice sleds\" for transport. Following his Terrigenesis, Blizzard also developed electricity manipulation, where he can manipulate electrical currents and charge the energies in his body.<ref name=\"Infinity: Heist #4\" />\n\n== Other versions ==\n=== Earth-X ===\nIn the ''[[Earth-X]]'' reality, the Donnie Gill version of Blizzard has the same history.

Speed Demon runs in, telling him that Power Pack has found them; Power Pack bursts in, and a fight ensues. At one point, Blizzard freezes the ground, causing Speed Demon to slip and smash into him. The Pack captures Blizzard, and [[Julie Power|Lightspeed]] takes his mask so she can rescue Irena from Speed Demon incognito.
