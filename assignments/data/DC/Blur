He is the second character to star in a book titled &#39;&#39;[[Son of Vulcan]]&#39;&#39;, the first being [[Son of Vulcan|Johnny Mann]], who was created by [[Charlton Comics]] in 1965 and later purchased by DC Comics in 1983.\n\nIn the modern version, Miguel Devante is known simply as &#39;&#39;Vulcan&#39;&#39; and first appears in &#39;&#39;Son of Vulcan&#39;&#39; vol. 2 #1 August 2005. He was created by [[Scott Beatty]] and [[Keron Grant]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nLong ago the [[White Martian]]s created a &#39;&#39;metavirus&#39;&#39;, a [[Metahuman#The Metagene|metagene]] that could be passed from host to host via touch. This metavirus was responsible for the empowerment of the very first &#39;&#39;&#39;Son of Vulcan&#39;&#39;&#39;. From that time on the Vulcans passed the metavirus down in an unbroken line, sworn to hunt and kill White Martians.\n\n===Vulcan===\nOrphan Miguel \&quot;Mikey\&quot; Devante, 14, is taken hostage by Jason Woodrue a.k.a. the [[Floronic Man]] at the Big Belly Burger in Miguel&#39;s hometown of &#39;&#39;&#39;Charlton\u2019s Point&#39;&#39;&#39;. A relatively unknown hero named Vulcan tells Mikey to free the other hostages while he battles the Floronic Man. Miguel stays back after freeing the other hostages to ensure Vulcan is safe. Miguel saves Vulcan from danger by chopping off Floronic Man&#39;s arm with Vulcan&#39;s sword. Vulcan chooses Miguel to be his successor and takes him from the Derby Youth Home orphanage to his base the &#39;&#39;&#39;Vulcan\u2019s Forge&#39;&#39;&#39;.\n\n===Son of Vulcan===\nBefore Miguel can be trained, Praetor, the computer for the Vulcan\u2019s Forge, informs Vulcan that Floronic Man has escaped from custody. Vulcan and his new sidekick, Miguel, go to put Floronic Man back in custody. Miguel quickly realizes that they are not fighting the real Floronic Man for he has two arms and not one. Vulcan is killed by a female White Martian named &#39;&#39;&#39;A&#39;Morr&#39;&#39;&#39; who was disguised as Floronic Man, but not before the Flame of Vulcan is passed on to Mikey.\n\nMiguel returns to Vulcan&#39;s Forge, where Praetor asks him to verify himself. Pandora, an android assistant of Vulcan&#39;s, learns that Vulcan has been killed, and she goes to retrieve the sword and helmet which were left behind in Miguel&#39;s hasty retreat. Praetor, upon Mikey&#39;s failure to recite any of the five governing laws of the Line of Fire and thus vox-confirm his identity as Vulcan, begins to scuttle the Forge and ejects Miguel into space, in compliance with Forge security protocols. Pandora saves Miguel and they try to leave the Forge in a jumpjet, the Justi-Flyer. Praetor turns Pandora off but Mikey escapes with the deactivated Pandora.\n\n===Rogues Gallery===\n[[Image:Witchazeldcu.png|thumb|100px|left|Witchazel]]\nAt the funeral for Vulcan, his \&quot;old\&quot; enemies, the &#39;&#39;&#39;Coalition of Crime&#39;&#39;&#39; (Witchazel, Dino-Mite, Monkey-in-the-Middle, Charliehorse, Little B.U.D.D.Y., Flex, Scramjet, and Fishmonger, all characters created for the new series), attack Miguel, who is helped by an old Son of Vulcan named &#39;&#39;&#39;Barney Blaine&#39;&#39;&#39;. From Blaine, Miguel learns that the White Martians created the Sons of Vulcan with a metavirus. \n[[Image:Newhybridsdcu.png|thumb|300px|right|The New Hybrids, artist [[Keron Grant]]]]\nMiguel is captured by a male White Martian named &#39;&#39;&#39;A&#39;monn A&#39;mokk&#39;&#39;&#39; but frees himself and destroys A&#39;morr, but the human-Martian hybrid children of A&#39;monn and A&#39;morr, &#39;&#39;&#39;Sapling&#39;&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;&#39;Buster&#39;&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;&#39;Silhouette&#39;&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;&#39;Quaker&#39;&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;&#39;Blur&#39;&#39;&#39; escape. Blur is an albino teenager wearing an altered form of the [[Reverse-Flash]]&#39;s costume, and he and his four siblings still retain a latent fear of fire. [[Funky Flashman]], who was a member of the first [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]] and who provided the White Martians with [[metahuman]] genes, never revealed whether or not Blur&#39;s human DNA came from [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] or [[Professor Zoom]]. Sapling resembled [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] in powers and costume, and Buster seemed like the character [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] (or maybe a cross between [[Bizarro]] and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]). Silhouette seemed to be wearing a variant of [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade&#39;s]] old costume (or perhaps the Shadow Thief&#39;s) and had similar powers. Quaker had similar powers to [[Quakemaster]]. All of the characters to whom the hybrids bear resemblance were at one time members of the original Secret Society of Super-Villains, as was Funky Flashman, so it&#39;s assumed that he got the genetic samples from those villains when they were members of the SSoSV.\n\nMiguel and the restored Pandora later go to San Francisco, where Miguel is seen talking to [[Beast Boy]] of the [[Teen Titans]] and presenting himself as simply &#39;&#39;Vulcan&#39;&#39;.\n\nVulcan next appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Infinite Crisis]]&#39;&#39; #6 among of the spell-casters who summon the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] at [[Stonehenge]].\n\n===\&quot;Trial by Fire\&quot; aftermath===\n{{main|White Martian}}\n\nIn the &#39;&#39;[[Justice League of America|JLA]]&#39;&#39; story arc \&quot;Trial by Fire\&quot;, an ancient Martian entity called Fernus takes possession of [[Martian Manhunter|J&#39;onn J&#39;onzz]] and seemingly exterminates all remaining members of the White Martian race, though surviving White Martians have been seen since, including [[Miss Martian]] and the faux Green Martians in the &#39;&#39;Martian Manhunter&#39;&#39; miniseries.\n\n===One Year Later===\n{{main|One Year Later}}\n\nVulcan recently appeared in &#39;&#39;[[Justice Society of America|JSA Classified]]&#39;&#39; #19 (Jan 2007), as an unwilling participant in one of [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Roulette]]&#39;s metahuman brawls, fighting against [[Bork (comics)|Bork]] of the [[Power Company]]. He flees, and later resurfaces as one of the new [[Titans East]] team members, under the leadership of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. His comeback is very short-lived, as the Titans are badly injured by [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]], and Vulcan is left comatose.\n\n===The New 52===\nVulcan is seen pursuing [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]] in the pages of &#39;&#39;Suicide Squad&#39;&#39; as the latter escapes in a commandeered ambulance to Gotham before his Justi-Flyer is disabled by a shot from Deadshot.\n\n==Powers, abilities, and equipment==\nThanks to the unique Vulcan Metavirus, Miguel is able to generate intense heat from any part of his body. Miguel wears a special suit of body armor created by previous Vulcans, with gauntlets capable of generating forcefields. All Vulcans carry a special sword with a translucent [[Monomolecular wire|monomolecular]] blade that can apparently cut through almost anything.\n\nThe Vulcans and Sons of Vulcan had access to the &#39;&#39;Encyclopedae Vulcanis&#39;&#39;, the collected lore of everyone who had ever borne the mantle of Vulcan.\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=36&amp;t=003555 Comicon Interview with Scott Beatty]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vulcan (Dc Comics)}}\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics male superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Greco-Roman mythology in DC Comics]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Articles about multiple fictional characters]]&quot;</span>
