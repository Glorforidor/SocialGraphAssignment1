Bivolo&#39;&#39;&#39;) is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[comic books]] by [[DC Comics]]. His real name is a pun based on the acronym \&quot;[[ROYGBIV]]\&quot; (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet, pronounced &#39;&#39;roy-gee-bihv&#39;&#39;), a mnemonic for the colors of a [[rainbow]]. He is a minor, though recurring, enemy of [[the Flash (Barry Allen)|the Flash]] and other heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |title=Hero-a-go-go!

Bivolo===\nAs a child, &#39;&#39;&#39;Roy G. Bivolo&#39;&#39;&#39; always dreamed of a career as an artist, a lofty goal considering he was completely [[colorblind]]. He would often paint what he thought were beautiful pieces of art, only to be told that it was made up of clashing colors. His father, an [[optometrist]] and genius in optical technology, swore he would find a cure for his son&#39;s disorder. Due to failing health, he was unable to complete his product, but instead created a sophisticated pair of goggles that would allow Roy to create beams of solid rainbow-colored light. On his death-bed, his father presents him with this gift, and it was not long before Roy found a sinister use for it.\n\nTurning to crime because the world did not appreciate his art, Roy, now the Rainbow Raider, went on a crime spree focused mostly on art galleries, saying that if he could not appreciate the great works of art in them (due to his disability), then no one else would. During this time he often clashes with the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], and sparks a rivalry that would last several years. Some years later he would fight [[Booster Gold]] as well. Rainbow Raider becomes the mind-addled slave of a crimelord in one of many alternate futures within the &#39;&#39;[[Armageddon 2001]]&#39;&#39; storyline.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Flash Annual&#39;&#39; #4 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; He is a central plot point in the first issue of the &#39;&#39;[[Underworld Unleashed]]&#39;&#39; storyline because even [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], the demonic antagonist, considered him pathetic, indeed even calling him a \&quot;[[paramecium]]\&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Underworld Unleashed&#39;&#39; #1 (November 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRainbow Raider once traded opponents with [[Batman]] villain [[Doctor Double X]] after meeting a motivational therapist named Professor Andrea Wye. Both of them are defeated by Batman and Flash.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Brave and the Bold&#39;&#39; #194&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nHe later becomes a minor enemy of the [[Justice League]], appearing briefly at a villains gathering &lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;JLA-80 Page Giant #1&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt; and later taking part in the riot in the super-hero prison of Belle Reve Penitentiary (he is quickly defeated by a single punch from [[Zauriel]]). During his time at Belle Reve, he was part of the Color Queens prison gang alongside [[Crazy Quilt]], [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], [[Doctor Spectro]], and [[Multi-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;JLA #34&#39;&#39; (October 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nRoy is slain by the villainess [[Blacksmith (comics)|Blacksmith]] when she impaled him with his latest work of art.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Flash&#39;&#39; vol.2 #183 (April 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the many deceased characters temporarily reanimated as a zombie within the Black Lantern Corps.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;[[Blackest Night]]&#39;&#39; #3 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n====&#39;&#39;The New 52&#39;&#39;====\nIn [[The New 52]], Roy uses the alias of &#39;&#39;&#39;Chroma&#39;&#39;&#39;, rather than Rainbow Raider. During the &#39;&#39;[[Forever Evil]]&#39;&#39; storyline, Chroma was present in Central City when [[Gorilla Grodd]] invaded the city with his army of gorillas. He, Girder, and Tar Pit saw [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] defeated by Gorilla Grodd. After Gorilla Grodd punches Girder enough to crumble, Chroma runs away with Tar Pit. Gorilla Grodd later kills Chroma to serve as a warning to the other villains that the Gem Cities are his. Upon [[Solovar]] being chained up, the heads of Chroma and the Mayor of Central City are placed around him.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Flash&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #23.1: Grodd&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nChroma later appears somehow alive and intact. He and Tar Pit are robbing jewelry stores until they are stopped by Flash.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Flash&#39;&#39; vol. 4 #27&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Rainbow Raiders===\nSince Rainbow Raider&#39;s death, a team of color-themed supervillains have dubbed themselves the &#39;&#39;&#39;Rainbow Raiders&#39;&#39;&#39; in his honor.\n\nAfter the death of the first [[Captain Boomerang]], a funeral was held that every villain ever to face Flash attended. Among the large crowd was an eclectic group of metahumans calling themselves the \&quot;Rainbow Raiders\&quot;, in honor of the late Flash villain. Their sentiments, expressed during the service, seemed to denote that the group was relatively new to the scene, and had little exposure, standing, or experience working together.\n\nThe Raiders were active during the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]&#39;s second invasion of Earth, encountering [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Power Ring (DC supervillains)|Power Ring]] (who were disguised as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] and [[Green Lantern]]) while attacking the [[Missoula County, Montana]] [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] facility. The battle goes badly for the two, but thanks to the help of nearby civilians, believing that their beloved heroes are in trouble, attack the Raiders and allow Power Ring and Johnny Quick to rally and subdue the group.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;JLA #110&#39;&#39;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe fate of the Rainbow Raiders was intended for the pages of &#39;&#39;[[Blackest Night]]&#39;&#39;, and was soon after released as a \&quot;deleted page\&quot; segment in &#39;&#39;Untold Tales of the Blackest Night&#39;&#39;. Believing that, with the dead attacking, it was best to be on the &#39;winning side&#39;, the Raiders committed mass suicide in order to join the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. However they remained dead, because they lacked any emotional ties sufficient to draw the attention of the black power rings, which focused on resurrecting people who would inspire certain emotions in Earth&#39;s heroes and villains, such as [[Lex Luthor]]&#39;s various murder victims, or fallen villains and heroes like [[Maxwell Lord]] and [[Elongated Man]].\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nRainbow Raider&#39;s powers are derived entirely from the special goggles he wears, which allow him to project solid beams of rainbow-colored light he can either use offensively or as a slide for travel. In addition, he can coat people in certain colors of light to induce emotions (coating someone in blue light, for instance, would make them sad).\n\nEach member of the Rainbow Raiders have powers based on their color:\n\n* Red: has super strength.\n* Orange: has fire powers.\n* Yellow: has super speed and electrical powers.\n* Green: manipulates plants.\n* Blue: is made of water.\n* Indigo: has shadow powers.\n* Violet: controls air and wind.\n\n==Other versions==\n* [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Jonathan Kent]] posed as a supervillain called Rainbow Raider as part of a plot to get [[Superman|Superboy]] to capture gangster Vic Munster and his gang by using a hypnotic device on his helmet. Vic Munster later used the Rainbow Raider identity where he was defeated by Superboy.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Superboy&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) #84 (October 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Dr. Quin (a villain from the first &#39;&#39;[[Dial H for Hero]]&#39;&#39; series) appears in &#39;&#39;[[House of Mystery]]&#39;&#39; #167 (June 1967) as a different Rainbow Raider. This version temporarily gave himself powers using a rare crystal that changed his body into different colors (slowly following the sequence of the rainbow). Depending on which color he was at the time, he would gain a different superpower: Red gave him a super-hot beam, Orange gave him an obscuring cloud, Yellow gave him the ability to drain energy and super powers, Green enables him to slow the bodies of others to the point of paralysis for an hour, and Violet shrinks people and objects for an hour. His Blue and Indigo powers are never shown. He also had a secret final color power called Ultra-Violet which made him invisible.&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;House of Mystery&#39;&#39; (vol. 1) #167 (June 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Roy G. Bivolo appears in &#39;&#39;[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]&#39;&#39;, portrayed by Paul Anthony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/22710-arrow-and-the-flash-crossover-details-reveal-captain-boomerang-and-rainbow-raider.html|title=ARROW and THE FLASH Crossover Details Reveal Captain Boomerang and ...Rainbow Raider?|work=Newsarama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is originally nicknamed &#39;&#39;&#39;Prism&#39;&#39;&#39; by [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]], but [[Killer Frost|Caitlin Snow]] suggests \&quot;Rainbow Raider\&quot;. Even though Cisco dismisses it as lame and he called it first, other characters refer to him as Rainbow Raider including Bivolo himself. Rather than use goggles, Bivolo&#39;s metahuman power allows him to [[Power ring (DC Comics)|incite rage]] in people by looking directly into their eyes. His eyes glow red when he uses this power. In the episode \&quot;[[Flash vs. Arrow]]\&quot; (which is a crossover over with &#39;&#39;[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]&#39;&#39;), Bivolo sends the Flash into a rage, but the [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Arrow]] is able to keep the Flash occupied long enough for [[Eobard Thawne|Dr. Wells]] and [[Joe West (Arrowverse)|Joe West]] to arrive and reverse the effect. Bivolo is later captured and imprisoned. In the episode \&quot;Rogue Air\&quot;, Rainbow Raider escapes from prison when [[Captain Cold]] sabotages the attempt to move the prisoners from the particle accelerator with the goal of gaining their aid at some future date.\n* Roy G. Bivolo is mentioned by [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] in &#39;&#39;[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]&#39;&#39;. In the episode [[Worlds Finest]], Barry, attempting to help [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara]] deal with the public&#39;s distrust of her after her exposure to [[Red Kryptonite]], describes the time when he went against Bivolo unprepared and was affected by his powers and became uncontrollably angry and aggressive, resulting in the public not believing him as a hero. Barry eventually stated that the people will forgive her and accept her as a hero after some time has passed.\n\n===Film===\n* Rainbow Raider appears in the film &#39;&#39;[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]]&#39;&#39;.\n\n===Video games===\n* Rainbow Raider appears as a playable character in &#39;&#39;[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]&#39;&#39;, as part of the Rainbow DLC pack.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Rainbow Raider appears at the beginning of the second volume of the [[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|comic book tie-in]] of &#39;&#39;[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]&#39;&#39;. He teams up with [[Crazy Quilt]] and [[Doctor Spectro]] to defeat Batman and [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;&#39;&#39;Batman: The Brave and the Bold&#39;&#39; Volume 2 #14&lt;/ref&gt;\n* Rainbow Raider appears in &#39;&#39;[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]&#39;&#39; tie-in novel, &#39;&#39;The Haunting of Barry Allen&#39;&#39;. Bivolo repeated tried to \&quot;whammy\&quot; his jailer, Cisco Ramon, leading to Cisco developing some mirrored glasses which reflected Bivolo&#39;s whammy back to himself. Bivolo then began confessing his deepest thoughts to Cisco, also explaining that he preferred the name \&quot;Rainbow Raider\&quot;. After Cisco showed the metas [[Tina Fey]] films and TV shows, Bivolo tried to act out &#39;&#39;[[Saturday Night Live]]&#39;&#39; sketches with him, which Cisco quickly grew tired of.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Heavy.com]] lists Rainbow Raider as one of the worst supervillains of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jensen|first1=K.
