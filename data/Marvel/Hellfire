After Mysterio defeated the Wind and Earth Elementals [[off-screen]], he went on to fight the Water Elemental in Venice while Nick Fury and Maria Hill persuaded Spider-Man to help Mysterio defeat the Fire Elemental in Prague. After finding a holographic projector however, Spider-Man and his friend Michelle Jones discovered that they were drones equipped with holographic technology, which Beck and a team of ex-[[Stark Industries]] employees used to make himself look like an [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]-level hero. When Beck learned of their discovery, he had his accomplices create an Elemental Fusion monster to distract the world while he set out to kill them. His plan was foiled when Spider-Man got into the illusion and deactivated the drones creating it before defeating Beck.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/elementl.htm|Elementals}}\n* {{Marveldatabase|Elementals}}\n\n{{Ms. Marvel}}\n{{Spider-Man}}\n\n{{Marvel-comics-stub}}"}]}}}}
