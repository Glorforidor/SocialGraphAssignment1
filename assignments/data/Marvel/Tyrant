Formerly a mortal man, Galactus is a [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] who originally consumed planets to sustain his life force, and serves a functional role in the upkeep of the [[Earth-616|primary Marvel continuity]]. Galactus was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in the comic book &#39;&#39;[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]&#39;&#39; #48, published in March 1966.\n\nLee and Kirby wanted to introduce a character that broke away from the archetype of the standard villain. In the character&#39;s first appearance, Galactus was depicted as a god-like figure who feeds by draining living planets of their energy, and operates without regard to the morality and judgments of mortal beings. Galactus&#39;s initial origin was that of a space explorer named Galan who gained cosmic abilities by passing near a star, but writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] further developed the origin of the character, revealing that Galan lived during the previous universe that existed prior to the [[Big Bang]] which began the current universe. As Galan&#39;s universe came to an end, Galan merged with the \&quot;[[Eternity (comics)|Sentience of the Universe]]\&quot; to become Galactus, an entity that wielded such cosmic power as to require devouring entire planets to sustain his existence. Additional material written by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[Jim Starlin]], and [[Louise Simonson]] explored Galactus&#39;s role and purpose in the Marvel Universe, and examined the actions of the character through themes of genocide, manifest destiny, ethics, and natural/necessary existence. Frequently accompanied by a herald (such as the [[Silver Surfer]]), the character has appeared as both antagonist and protagonist in central and supporting roles. Since debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Galactus has played a role in over five decades of Marvel continuity.\n\nThe character has been featured in other Marvel media, such as [[arcade game]]s, [[video game]]s, animated television series, and the 2007 film &#39;&#39;[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]&#39;&#39;. In 2009, Galactus ranked 5th on [[IGN]]&#39;s list of \&quot;Top 100 Comic Book Villains\&quot;, which cited the character&#39;s \&quot;larger-than-life presence\&quot; as making him one of the more important villains ever created. IGN also noted \&quot;Galactus is one of the few villains on our list to really defy the definition of an evil-doer\&quot; as the character is compelled to destroy worlds because of his hunger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-villains/5.html \&quot;Galactus is number 5\&quot;] [[IGN]], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist-coplotter [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[First appearance|debuted]] in &#39;&#39;[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]&#39;&#39; #48 (March 1966, the first of a three-issue story later known as \&quot;[[The Galactus Trilogy]]\&quot;).&lt;ref name=\&quot;TR\&quot;&gt;Thomas, Roy, &#39;&#39;Stan Lee&#39;s Amazing Marvel Universe&#39;&#39; (Sterling Publishing, New York, 2006), \&quot;Moment 29: The Galactus Trilogy\&quot;, pp. 112\u2013115. {{ISBN|1-4027-4225-8}}; {{ISBN|978-1-4027-4225-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\&quot;kirbycollector1\&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal\n | last = Hatfield\n | first = Charles\n | author-link =\n | title = The Galactus Trilogy: An Appreciation\n | journal = The Collected Jack Kirby Collector\n | volume = 1\n | page = 211\n | date = February 2004\n | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n===Origin===\n{{Main|The Galactus Trilogy}}\nIn 1966, nearly five years after launching [[Marvel Comics]]&#39; flagship [[superhero]] title, &#39;&#39;Fantastic Four&#39;&#39;, creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] collaborated on an antagonist designed to break the [[supervillain]] mold of the tyrant with god-like stature and power.&lt;ref name=\&quot;kirbycollector1\&quot;/&gt; As Lee recalled in 1993,\n\n{{quote|\&quot;Galactus was simply another in a long line of super-villains whom we loved creating. ...[W]e felt the only way to top ourselves was to come up with an evil-doer who had almost godlike powers. Therefore, the natural choice was sort of a demi-god, but now what would we do with him? We didn&#39;t want to use the tired old cliche about him wanting to conquer the world. There were enough would-be world conquerors in the Marvel Universe and in all the other comic book galaxies. That was when inspiration struck. Why not have him not be a really evil person? After all, a demi-god should be beyond mere good and evil. He&#39;d just be (don&#39;t laugh!) hungry. And the nourishment he&#39;d require is the life force and energy from living planets!\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Stan. \&quot;Introduction\&quot; (second page, unnumbered) 1993, &#39;&#39;Marvel Masterworks: The Fantastic Four Vol. 5&#39;&#39;&lt;!--as spelled in copyright indicia--&gt; (Marvel Publishing : second edition, second printing, 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-7851-1184-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\nKirby described his biblical inspirations for Galactus and an accompanying character, an angelic herald Lee called the [[Silver Surfer]]:\n\n{{quote|\&quot;My inspirations were the fact that I had to make sales and come up with characters that were no longer stereotypes. In other words, I couldn&#39;t depend on gangsters. I had to get something new. For some reason, I went to the Bible and I came up with Galactus. And there I was in front of this tremendous figure, who I knew very well because I&#39;ve always felt him. I certainly couldn&#39;t treat him in the same way I could any ordinary mortal. And I remember in my first story, I had to back away from him to resolve that story. The Silver Surfer is, of course, the fallen angel. When Galactus relegated him to Earth, he stayed on Earth, and that was the beginning of his adventures. They were figures that had never been used before in comics. They were above mythic figures. And of course they were the first gods.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video\n | people = Viola, Ken\n | title = The Masters of Comic Book Art\n | medium = VHS\n | publisher = Viola, Ken\n | location = USA\n | date = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n\nKirby elaborated, \&quot;Galactus in actuality is a sort of god. He is beyond reproach, beyond anyone&#39;s opinion. In a way he is kind of a Zeus, who fathered Hercules. He is his own legend, and of course, he and the Silver Surfer are sort of modern legends, and they are designed that way.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, William A., and Mark Seifert.

In the nascent Marvel Universe, characters acted consistently, whatever comic they were appearing in. Their actions reverberated through every title.

Numerous requests from fans prompted the character to be featured heavily in &#39;&#39;Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; #72\u201377 (Mar. \u2013 Aug. 1968).&lt;ref name=\&quot;kirbycollector2\&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/effect/2012/06/19/a-failure-to-communicate-part-two A Failure to Communicate, Part 2], Jack Kirby Museum, June 19, 2012 (accessed Feb. 14, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; After a flashback appearance in &#39;&#39;Silver Surfer&#39;&#39; #1 (Aug. 1968), the character returned to Earth in &#39;&#39;Thor&#39;&#39; #160\u2013162 (Jan. \u2013 Mar. 1969). Galactus&#39;s origin was eventually revealed in &#39;&#39;Thor&#39;&#39; #168\u2013169 (Sept. \u2013 Oct. 1969).\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\nThe character made appearances in &#39;&#39;Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; #120\u2013123 (March \u2013 June 1972) and &#39;&#39;Thor&#39;&#39; #225\u2013228 (Jul. \u2013 Oct. 1974). These two storylines introduced two new [[Heralds of Galactus|heralds for Galactus]]. Galactus also featured in &#39;&#39;Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; #172\u2013175 (Jul. \u2013 Oct. 1976) and #208\u2013213 (Jul. \u2013 Dec. 1979).\n\n[[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] reunited for the origin of Silver Surfer and Galactus in the one-shot [[graphic novel]] &#39;&#39;The Silver Surfer: The Ultimate Cosmic Experience!&#39;&#39; in 1978. This [[Marvel Fireside Books|Marvel Fireside Book]], published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], was an out-of-continuity retelling of the origin story without the Fantastic Four.\n\nThe full Lee-and-Kirby origin story was reprinted in the one-volume &#39;&#39;Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin&#39;&#39; #1 (May 1983), inked by [[Vince Colletta]] and [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]], lettered by [[Jack Morelli|John Morelli]] and colored by [[Andy Yanchus]]. While nearly identical to the previous origin, this story featured supplemental material, edits, and deletions by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]], pencillers [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]] and inker [[Jack Abel]]. Rather than traveling into a dying star, the character enters the [[World egg#Influences on science fiction and popular culture|core of the collapsing universe]] before the [[Big Bang]]; the story was later reprinted as &#39;&#39;Origin of Galactus&#39;&#39; #1 (Feb. 1996).\n\nThe character guest-starred in &#39;&#39;[[Rom the Space Knight|Rom]]&#39;&#39; #26\u201327 (Jan. \u2013 Feb. 1982). Galactus featured in two related storylines of &#39;&#39;Fantastic Four&#39;&#39; #242\u2013244 (May \u2013 July 1982) and later #257 (August 1983), in which writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] introduced the conceit of Galactus feeling remorse for his actions, and the weight of his genocides. In the issue, [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] assures Galactus of his role and purpose as one of shepherd and weeder in guiding the universe to its proper purpose, and Galactus remains resolute. Byrne further elaborated on this concept in &#39;&#39;[[Fantastic Four]]&#39;&#39; #262 (Jan. 1984), which sparked controversy. At the end of the story, [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], an abstract entity in the Marvel Universe, appears to validate the existence of Galactus as necessary for the natural order and essential to prevent an even more catastrophic fate; [[Howard University]] professor of literature Marc Singer criticized this, accusing writer-artist of using the character to \&quot;justify planetary-scale genocide.\&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Marc.

Elaborating on what inspired the change, Ewing explained \&quot;What inspired it\u2014a mixture of wanting someone big on or allied with the team\u2014originally, we thought about Odin, but he&#39;s a bit busy\u2014and my usual preoccupations with atonement, redemption, growth and change.

Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The entity later rescues the team at the behest of Eternity, and learns that the latter has been imprisoned by an unknown force. Galactus also comes into conflict with fellow cosmics [[Lord Chaos]] and [[Master Order]], who, with the [[Molecule Man]], wish for Galactus to return to his former role as a Devourer of Worlds and thereby restore order to the universe. Galactus locates the hero Anti-Man outside the multiverse and, after transforming him into a Herald of Life, sends him to recruit the recently disbanded Ultimates to help discover the identity of Eternity&#39;s captor, who is later revealed to be the First Firmament, the first iteration of the cosmos. Lord Chaos and Master Order bring Galactus to trial before the [[Living Tribunal]], still seeking to restore Galactus to his former state for the sake of the cosmic balance. Although Galactus successfully argues that the balance of the new Multiverse is different and that his old role is obsolete, the Tribunal is destroyed by a Firmament-influenced Master Order and Lord Chaos. After a brief battle, Master Order decides to create a new cosmic order, which it and Lord Chaos control. Their former servant, the In-Betweener, is forcibly merged with them into a new cosmic being called &#39;&#39;Logos&#39;&#39;. After destroying several Celestials, Logos forcibly transforms Galactus back into the Devourer of Worlds. The process is reversed when Anti-Man sacrifices his life to restore Galactus as the Lifebringer.
